Hi, how are you?
00:00:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Good, good. So what's going on with you? happened this morning?
00:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have to get my hormone levels checked because I get estrogen and progesterone. And also I need keep an eye on my A1c, which is, I have diabetes. I don't have it, but I don't want to get it and just keep an eye on it. But I normally have really tiny veins that are not very good to draw. But I've been taking Clariton because my allergies have been super bad, like my whole face hurts here all the time. all the time. Anyway, and on top of that, I'm about to start my period. So I'm extra emotional and extra sensitive. And she put the tourniquet extra tight so she could find it dug in this arm didn't get it.
00:01:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's the tourniquet on this one.
00:01:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's bruised from the tourniquet.
00:01:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then she told me she would not dig in this hand, but she did.
00:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Finally got the blood three cubes, but the whole thing just hurt. don't normally cry from the pain, but like it was a lot today.
00:01:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:01:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mostly, I think probably because of hormones, but, and I was going in feeling like I was about to have a hot flash. Haven't eaten because you can't it was a fasting lab. Anyway, so this morning is emotional and I'm just ready to get on with my day. Yes, last night, I was using I hate. This is my executive dysfunction. writing anything about myself. If it's for a specific purpose of teaching somebody and tell my story because this story pertains to what you are doing and it's actually about you being my training of my experience then I'm you know I don't think about it but so what I did was I went to chat GPT with the stories I'm like I don't even know what stories it has because I've given it so much stuff and so it wrote a lot of things for me for my history and then I went in found my trainings sorry let's see for things that I had created let me shut my screen assignment that that we had I think that it needs the next iteration, but for me, I can't even explain how much I hate this type of stuff and how hard it is for me to do, especially when I'm not feeling great emotionally. Yeah. But I did because I want to make traction. So, I have base camp training videos. Nice. I teach people, I taught people, this was 12 years ago when I first created about boomerang for Gmail.
00:03:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you know what that is? Yes. Yes. attempted use it as well, but I don't use it as much, but it sounds cool.
00:03:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We don't. I mean, Gmail actually has integrated a lot of the features that Boomerang had and also taught about, yes, where I taught people how to filter their emails and use smart filters, so their inbox isn't full all the time. Let's see, reportive, and yes, where reportive is another Gmail integration that uses canned responses so that you can kind of automate, so yes, where, and reportive do a lot of the same things.
00:04:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And again, this was 12 years ago. I haven't been using them because I don't really need to because I barely work and I just have the same clients though, but that's not really scalable anyway, and not a real business.
00:04:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a job. Like I haven't dropped, let's be honest about that. Anyway, but reportive allows you to create different types of canned responses and connect with your team, so you can customize them for people and you can have those response times like Gmail lets you do a lot of things again. that it does, but it still has some other things. I had the timesheet homework, which is now the PTE Maximizer. have a video for that. I taught people how to use LastPass. I haven't gone through this, but I wonder what the webinar is. I had this program called Social Media Profits, like, because I had this partner was all about, we got to make money blah, blah, blah, this was not when he was my love, but he was just like an associate. He's very professional, like he won't associate the discord, but he always cared about me as a single mom, and he didn't want to see me be taking advantage of, and he knew things about my partner. so he would kind of try to get me to basically open my eyes, notice this thing, notice that thing and just kind of around it. and then anyway figured it out got rid of that partner and then ended up falling in love with my hero so yeah kept him nice love him anyway so um and so for i'll show you what and blah blah blah that was not good chat gpt and i got just kind of roughly which i need to assemble that's not it okay i'm going up there was a basically it took a few stories that i found and then it took some testimonials and turned it into um a story at one point it makes stories together and it put you in with my story coffee shop millionaire that was from like 13 years ago i'm like you know you're making stuff up now so um hold on a sec there's just a couple there's like one area i would show you and so my job is i'm just gonna take all of this and put it into a Google Doc and use it as kind of a framework to remind myself and modify it. Okay, so I think there was actually one more version after this that I like that one. Um, yeah, there's some things I have to modify here, but I've been an entrepreneur.
00:07:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Did you care if I read it? Like I feel like this is way my brain processes stop.
00:07:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, I've been an entrepreneur for as long as I can remember. My first taste of running a business came when I was just 10 years old, babysitting in the neighborhood, then quickly expanding my repertoire to a paper route of 11 and mowing lawns as a preteen and a team. Even back then I wasn't just doing it for pocket money. I have my sights on something bigger. This is not mine. I knew I was meant to create opportunities, not just for myself, for others, chat, dbt, liberties. Yeah. And I don't even know where this story came from. So as I got older, I naturally gravitated towards jobs that would change me to think like a leader, also totally, whatever, made that up. I found myself working in corporate America where the stakes were high level. I would say this is it. Our jobs were constantly under threat of being outsourced to places like Costa Rica or the Philippines. You had the pre-work every single day, and there was this relentless grind of reporting systems that were painfully, anyway. Okay, so bottom line is that that's where I got started. I'll rewrite this, but it was that we were in a, and I might have told you this, but in, so let's see, I worked there from 1996 to 2002. And so we had Excited Home, Apple, Intel, Adobe, Visio, all under one roof in a call center. And I, at the time was working, at the time of discovering this, I was working for Intel, and so my job was a technical team lead, but it was basically a business within a business. So I was responsible for staffing, 30 percent team, 24 hours a day, and I was responsible for hiring, coaching, terminating, so everything there, and then meeting corporate metrics. So Intel had a contract with Sykes, which was the company that I worked for, that we would answer calls within a certain amount of time, that we would resolve the calls within a certain amount of time, and at the call, the average length of the calls would be a certain amount of things. So that, those were our metrics. If we exceeded those metrics, there was a bonus, if we failed to meet those metrics, we didn't, we were penalized significantly financially, we didn't even get our contract. That would happen. And there would be this phone call from Sykes corporate office. Well, first from Intel corporate to Sykes corporate, then to my building. And then everything flowed downhill.
00:10:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And so we'd have this emergency meeting.
00:10:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Somebody's going to lose their job because we're in districts. OK, well, how come we didn't know that in the first place, and how come we weren't taking care of it, and I'm tired of getting threatened? Meanwhile, most of this stuff and most of these, even the managers were industry level workers. And all the job was on the job training. So most of the people didn't care. It was just a good paycheck.
00:10:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They didn't have the work, flipping burgers, whatever.
00:10:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. But I didn't want to be threatened. I didn't want to go flip burgers. I dropped out of college. I wanted this to work. I also really loved the technology, and I loved what I was learning. So anyway, we had a Lucid technology phone. I know those big black phones that have those buttons. on them like tons and tons of buttons on them. So those buttons had all these different modes where you could put yourself. So one was like waiting for a call, one was you're on the call, one was hold, one was transfer, one was called ACW, which is after call waiting where we would write our notes, whatever. So all of those different things had metrics, but tied to that was the technology that allowed reporting. So the phones could, there was a server that tracks how long each phone, because each phone was programmed with its own number. So how long it was in each of those modes and during which time we even used it as a time clock, that was where you logged in and logged out at the end of the day. So, you know, 1996, 2004, this technology was there, but the reporting was archaic and it didn't really exist. I can't really say archaic because it was still pretty modern at the time. But what it wasn't able to do, who spit out a report that automatically told us are we in metrics or are we not that did not exist. So after about the third time being this position as a manager and going through one of these types of meetings and being like, you know, cortisol pumping through my body, maybe in short style, like what's going to happen. Like I got to figure out how to know ahead of time where I stand so that I don't go, am I the one? Is it me? So what I found out was that where there were five reports that that the loosened phone system had that if I put them into a spreadsheet and did a few formulas, I would know exactly where we stood. So it took five of them. Now, again, I so when I started working there was 21. And when I left, yeah, hold on, 2000. Yeah, something like that. No, actually, I think it started when I was 19. So anyway, again, and this is 1996, like emails brand Like technology, most people haven't been using computers, word processing was basic, knowing Excel was not something that everybody knew. few people knew it. Google Docs didn't exist at the time. So I had a friend, he was also LDS and nerdy, he was in Excel all the time. like, can you show me this? Cause I saw what he was looking at and there were formulas and numbers, I was like, is this? And so I asked him if there was a way that he could help me do this thing that I was trying to do with these different reports to make these calculations. so he helped me put some calculations in. So I had five different tabs in one workbook. And so I would dump each of the reports into five tabs. in the mornings, I would go run the report, copy and paste it into the five, just raw data tabs. And then I would have a formula on the fifth one that would do the calculations to see. So it took me 15 minutes. That's all it took. 15 minutes to find out are we a metrics and are we not and which agent of mine out of my 30 people was in metrics and which were more which meant I could then go coach them and I could look at why like because we already did call tracking but we didn't have any data to measure okay I can tell you if you did this good or bad but I can't tell you are you doing it with the end the amount of time you're supposed to be doing it because they actually implemented that corporate worldwide and it was a worldwide company and I never got stressed out about those meetings again because I was always in metrics I hired better from that because I learned to profile people looking at that a little bit better I had a brand new epiphany so everything that I do for my clients has stemmed from the experience of being under constant threat of losing my job and watching watching the cycle of Easter, right? Like, Hey, we're all good. all good. Oh, we're gonna lose our jobs. Like we, the sky is falling with really analogy, because nobody thought anything was wrong and all of a sudden we're being pulled into meetings and we're being threatened with our jobs. So, um, but it was, it was looking at metrics and figuring out that there are certain numbers that matter and have to be measured constantly and they have to be managed to constantly. And if those things are done, then everything else is kind of smooth sailing. So anyway, then went and applied it to these different things.
00:15:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is So, why did you stop selling the coffee shop millionaire?
00:15:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I quit working for them.
00:15:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, so I never sold it. Oh, sorry. thought that was your product, but you're right.
00:15:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was this other dude. I remember this now. Yeah, yeah. And he called me on a Sunday and kept calling me and texting me and I told him I don't work on the weekends and I do not talk to anybody on. Sundays. And he was like, I know you're there, like, why aren't you answering? I was like, Oh, I had no other money, no other income for kids going through a I was already going bankrupt because I was making them all this money and they're paying me $15 an hour. And he wasn't going to treat me like that on top of it. Like, bye. So he tried to hire me again a couple times after that. But yeah, anyway, yeah, they had no structure. And then was your strength, your strength labs, they were doing good. I just came in and they did much, much better. Like, regs, this is what Matt Davis said they were doing 400,000 a month. And that I, and then they sold the company for $10 million a couple years later. Do you have a testimony from them saying they went from 400,000 most to eight, I do Matt. And you know, the only way that I got it was because he wanted to hire me again. Yeah. And because Ryan wasn't going to give it to me. So this is what Matt said. Something put Tina keeps getting us results in. She came to help out our company when we were having some growing pains and needed to help cleaning up our systems. At that point, we were doing a few hundred thousand per month, fast forward, 12 months, and we've increased our revenue tenfold. Tina played a huge part in helping us to do this rapidly. She took our ideas and visions and made them a reality and we couldn't have grown this fast without her. That's 100% too. So what I did for them is I put everything in base camps. They had meetings on a regular basis and they were not due dates and they were not accountability. So Ryan did a really good job of saying what he wanted done, but he didn't want to manage anybody. And Matt had a very different personality. He just had his first baby. And he did research, whatever. They were very different personality types. then on top of that, we had a... a media buyer was just either Ellison and graphics and things like that, everything had to be coordinated and done. So there was nobody keeping track of anything. And it was just the virtue of keeping track of everything, having 18 meetings. So we were all on the same page and me saying, okay, who's doing that? When did you get done? then the week, okay, where we are because you haven't said there's any problems. So I'm expecting it's going to be done on time. And a few times of, well, no, it's behind and a few times of I didn't get it done, but I didn't say anything and me going, okay, that's unacceptable, either fix it or we find somebody else stuck out done. So, yeah, those were my biggest, I do have like the other stories would be testimonial stories that I have from people and they're they're good. But the thing is, I haven't worked for a ton of people. What I've stated. in areas and done well for a while. also, I never worked more than 20 hours a week. And a lot of people have locked me in experience, but not in efficacy. And that's really kind of the whole thing about it. So anyway, that's that's my homework. have some trainings that existed that could be repurposed and just kind of refreshed a little bit for just general tips and tools and a story behind it to say, this is what these types of simple systems, that's the thing, they're not none of them are complicated. about this is super fancy. about anything that I do is really exceptional. It's not it's not I show up consistently and I measure the things that matters and matter and I manage the things that matter every single day. And that's it. And don't allow distractions too. So this is the other thing is, each of these companies and owners would be like, well, would be cool if, and want to do other things. And I would say, okay, if you do that, are you still going to get this done on time? If you do that, is that more important than this thing? Because every time you've wanted to go off and do this, then you neglected this.
00:20:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And so I have refused to work for anybody that sabotaged the work that we've agreed to do.
00:20:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm like, I'm either staying on task or I'm leaving because you're sabotaging my ability to do my job, and I'm not going to deal with that kind of stress.
00:20:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And it's not sort of what you're doing for Dan right now? Ryan?
00:20:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Ryan? Yeah, it's what we did. But having been seven years in, he doesn't really have to be in questions. asked you, well, why do it that way? And it was cost or have you followed up with this? So because he does have a lot of different things going on. But the difference with him and everybody else is that his pace is very chill and laid back and can be because he's got a business that runs like clockwork and does really well. And even when something goes wrong, it's still really good. they have to check out the page just and they bled money and he like, it'll fix it. It'll work.
00:21:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anybody else will lose their mind.
00:21:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Dan is really like not one to compare to anything else. But I would think, um, see, he is not a testimonial kind of person. He has said something before.
00:21:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's like, there you go, Tina, that's the best you're ever going to get. it was amazing. I didn't. Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah. Remember when I had to call him, he showed
00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, that fun. I think it was a CPA thing or a counting thing or something like that.
00:22:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, it's like this. Yeah. Okay. So it's Chris. Yeah.
00:22:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And Dan Meredith, it was, was wanting to get into copy. He was copywriting, but he was kind of new at it and he had his gym. But he did everything on notebooks and he just, I think he didn't define his values in the beginning. And so that was one of the conversations. And then it was stick to them, you know, and his values were shifting. And that's something that people have to take into account because values do shift generally until you kind of lock into your real core values and then they really never shift, not the main ones. But there's a point in most people's lives where they're shifting, shifting, shifting until they lock. I think kids are locked in now, but then they were definitely in flux and it was just the conversation about what you want, be clear about what you want, be honest about what you want, be aware of the way that you're sabotaging your opportunities to get what you want and stay focused, stop trying to please everybody, stop trying to, you know, don't say that you want to be a business owner and then also want to go play and do all these things, like which one matters most? If you want to play most, be honest about that and go do that. But don't act like you're a business owner that you care about the business. And so those are the conversations to have with a lot of people and like I've got one client and he's an eight figure client and he wants a lot of growth and but what he wants most is freedom. And so, the kind of growth that he wants requires more management than he wants to put in, and I said, that's okay, but you just have to be aware that there's this disconnect and pick the thing that you want most and the thing he wants most is to not have to show up in the office when he doesn't want to show up in So, then you have to be okay with, you know, 80, 20, right, this 20% of the time that you're not there, that a lot of stuff is just not going to be optimized and working the way that it should, but it's so profitable, and it gives you everything else that you want, except for the massive success that you want, you know, you have to be with the trade-off that you're not getting to the level of accomplishment that you want to, because the other accomplishment is you have a ton of freedom. Freedom and happiness that other people will never have.
00:24:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, yeah, true. Um, I wanted to also though, uh, I kind of, I didn't do my story all that yet, but I did do, I listed off a whole bunch of products and I had a Google She already for some other products with my own possible brand name, but I wanted to segue straight to Joanne because like, oh, yeah. Sorry. It's okay. It's okay.
00:25:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
because I have a three o'clock.
00:25:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I got half an it's all, it's all good. And so like, do we want to just see what she's given me already?
00:25:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Yeah, because I haven't even gone through all the stuff that she sent over.
00:25:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's been crazy. Either by either by.
00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll let you share.
00:25:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Just to have a gander here, some stuff I just started filling out. I have like so many things, like micro offer magic is my main course, but I have like from likes to members. 7-figure offer launcher, I-impossible sales system, traffic and sprint workshop, I-impossible sales system. I'm all over the map, ADHD, can see, I have e-commerce email promotions, swipe send profit, I-impossible success system, that was like teaching people how to make their first 1K and was like a Facebook group. I have scale of challenges and also the ultimate challenge masterclass is challenges kind of on the OG for way back in the day before everybody else is doing them. Ultimate webinar, and that's how I made my first million through those $17 challenges. Ultimate webinar sales, visibility workshop, ultimate Facebook group, cash injection, I wouldn't look at this now because I don't believe in Facebook groups as much right now, even though people are still using them, love and ways to grow good fast and then old stuff, like we're talking like from more than 10 years ago, get published mastery. Well, this one's not 10 years, this was three years ago, this was a 3K, six month cohort, I mean like 25K. one month selling it, a social sales system, just teaching people how to make money on social sales using Facebook groups or Facebook or social media and bring them to a book or call funnel or selling, know, cohort. Fast-cast mastery, these are old ones now. If I were to say the first ones, this was the first one. The first one that really took off, I had the ultimate consulting challenge. I think I first sold for a buck and five bucks. Thousands went through it. Like I had 6,000 buyers of this low ticket that I increased at four and I said, this was a great kind of catalog model to everything else because as I got all these buyers, then I would have an ultimate Facebook challenge because to be a good consultant, they needed no social media. I would have mobile challenge to be a consultant.
00:27:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They needed to learn how to also deal with mobile optimized websites because remember, this is like 12 years ago.
00:27:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Then I had social media challenge because being a consultant, they needed to learn how to use social media. same thing to make it's all you hadn't learned video. So that call me calm automated in me offering a social media certification program down here. And that was a 2k program that certified people in social media. And that was back in 2010 or 11. So I sold 200,000 one week social is at that time no one had a social media certification. Everybody knows brother has that now vacation.
00:28:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I guess before Kate Buck had social media manager pro.
00:28:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is before Kate Buck existed. This is back.
00:28:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that was great.
00:28:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Wow. Yeah, was. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Social media certification program like innovator. Yeah, like the thing is, you know, what means I'm usually always innovating on what's trending right now and using what, you know, kind of like a superstructure what people all know and stuff. And I had momentum like once I had this all going, I had such momentum.
00:28:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, that had been costing though.
00:28:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It was because every month I was launching something new. It totally was right, but I had team like I use these and that's different. Yeah I was using base camp.
00:29:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I had a really good team like you know, and I had a lot of JB partners So it was I was I was true leader like in the CEO of the of the business We were making at least a hundred thousand a month and I was you gonna have a great podcast episode about this and break this down And some trainings about what because there are different seasons, you know And we use stuff like that and like I was the first thing I was gonna say My head is like that was not a leverage business except for you were leveraging trends For business opportunities and revenue opportunities because another thing I was thinking Earlier today. I was like I would never do X. I would never do X. Like all I was listening to a podcast They were talking about the restaurant business and how hard it is and it's such like Fin margins. I'm like I would never do that and I'm like but what if that was the only thing I could do to make money What if that was thing I knew, what if I had no other skills, like, yeah, what mind to say, I would stick up my nose and say, I would never do that. And also where he if nobody did that. And so I kind of caught myself in my ignorance and against, like, I, because first of all, I don't believe in infinitives for the most part, never always this type of thing. Because for the most part, I think there are very few things that are eternally and infinitely ever true. But that the seasons are really important. And I think as coaches or consultants or whatever or leaders or teachers, is that we help people understand that there is a season where something does not make sense for you, don't do it. But only you can know that and other times where it does. But like, because if you go listen to somebody who's telling you to do something that's not compatible with your season, your environment, your skills, do our values, et cetera, then you are creating, that is a recipe for disaster on a spiritual level, on an emotional relationship level, like anything that you do something is just so counter to those particular things, an environment, skill set, relationships, values, whatever. It's destructive inside and you'll just implode in. But this is amazing, all of your things. You put time, could you put a timeline to the left, roughly like 2010, like drag it down for whatever ones you did in that area?
00:31:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sure, I'll do that later just because I want to talk about it. Sorry.
00:31:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's so much.
00:31:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm just like, whoa. Yeah, no, no, I've been thinking about that too because they'll even show people how many products I've created and stuff. video ads made easy. was more in 2016. That was before people were teaching about video ads. Because one of my nephew, I brought his e-comm company to 1k day in sales using video ads, and we sold it 18 months later from startup for over a million dollars to venture capital company, that to e-comm company. Facebook ads scale, that was probably 2020, Black Friday, Cyber Monday Toolkit, that's probably 2020.
00:32:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, is that what made you post the...
00:32:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, because I just have to change dates, like the email's already done and everything, so yeah. That's awesome. Email-deliverability class, I actually did that a few months ago because I wanted to start doing some master classes to then put into little ticket funnels.
00:32:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You looked as crazy as I started teaching about that in 2000, it was with coffee shop just talking about it, and it's actually how I had my first conversation with my sweetheart because he had an email list. So they were getting 10,000 names on it a day.
00:33:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
he's like, whoa, yes, 10,000 names, 10,000, 10,000 often today.
00:33:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's big time. Yeah, but yeah, but they, but they didn't, but it was a new thing to be thinking about sender scores and reputation and inbox placement, that kind of thing. But but I was learning about it because it was impacting us at that time. So yeah, yeah, yep.
00:33:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anyway, wow, that's pretty well. Anyways, okay. So I'm just going to sit you this alive.
00:33:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean, well, this is shows what it's probably so you are.
00:33:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I'm so glad you did this. And Frank Kern promoted this, by the way.
00:33:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was funny. I found him on my list when I was looking through my email list. Oh, yeah. Yeah, Frank at Frank Kern dot com.
00:33:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
think it was funny. Yeah. So okay, so let's go to this girl by the way. Hey, I did post another comeback just for the hell of it. Hey, I'll do a done for you funnel. I don't know if they've released it yet. Uh, but I said they have to have $20,000 working capital. So just FYI just posted that today. Um, just to say my self time because people have been reached out to me, but they like want me for implementation and they want something for cheap.
00:34:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyways, it looks like I've improved yet, but all right up in here.
00:34:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:34:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what was, uh, that's the thing though. So this time next week, Maria, if we, if we spend this, we really, um, putting these things, these two things together. And even if we just like record ourselves having conversation about the things that we've done and built and who we served, then go frame the offer after somebody can be like, who are you?
00:34:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've never heard of you. And then they go watch. This is what you did.
00:34:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:34:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know what I mean? Yeah, there's only once like glitch because it's Canadian Thanksgiving this weekend.
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I am. Taking Friday money. Oh, okay.
00:35:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's only glitch. It's FYI. I think it's Joanne, right? I was gonna dump her stuff into one of the Google Doc because she sends me so many things. Well, look at the free group. You should probably look at my new funnel. We are in the process of making. I don't want to get dropped into too much.
00:35:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's red clogs all over the place. Those are the types of people. They want you to work without money and you realize me looking at your stuff is you taking my time.
00:35:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, we could turn the table and look at something, make some if you want to continue with us and I can just give it the CMO.
00:35:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
COO's thing is that it hates 6,000.
00:35:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you want to do this, like, or out? Or something else that's, yeah, because it's just, um, yeah, I mean, I can do two YouTube videos in the time that we took to talk to her that three hours that one night, then I would have, you know, tons of views on YouTube and build in my YouTube channel, you know, yeah, so I think it's important to see you see what if you can improve what we have, we have six, so that's the other end flag, we have six ages, she's trying fail, so I want to be fully transparent. So she repeats that a lot too, by the way.
00:36:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, um, what's the common denominator?
00:36:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Of why the agency tried to fail, I don't know.
00:36:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She is the common denominator. Her business is the common denominator.
00:36:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, because I can't believe that she would hire a new agency now and expect them to beat the past agencies when it's like the election month's coming up and it's most time to run ads. Yeah, you know, so she's probably going to complain about these guys, you know, unless she's because I said it, maybe that's in her ear now, both.
00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
These guys. Well, the other thing is when you go into somebody like that, like the odds that you're going to succeed are slim and then your reputation is messed up because they go around, this person couldn't do it either.
00:37:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
not going to put myself in that situation. Yeah, so she keeps talking about this funnel. I was thinking while we look at the free group, we should probably look at my new funnel, so I'm just going to highlight this new funnel. So I don't know where what her new funnel is. I think it's important for you to see if can improve what we have. So really she wants us to come in and optimize her business.
00:37:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's the thing. I never talk about this because it hasn't come up too much, but people have to have, so there's a minimum amount income to have at least... 50% profit margins so that they've got some working capital. She does not have 50% profit margins and she's got maybe like 10%, I don't hold on let me see, she said 2.6, so I to do this, 1, 2, well let me do this. What percentage of $2.6 million is $600,000? I'm just going to show my likes on 23%, yeah 23% margins, okay 6, 1, 2, 1, 2, divide by 2, I have 60% so I have no idea if you can see my animals but I'm going to turn my share screen off.
00:38:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay and because it's just really funny because the cat and dog are almost beside each other and that's
00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
not that often you see the baby's where's the baby's oh barely see i know hold on let me let me try and reorganize this oh my gosh the cats in the cat bed and the dog is right there leading up against the couch oh is that funny i just don't see that that often love it really just looking away he's all tired up because he was at the doggy daycare i picked him up just about an hour ago yeah she's funny she's got that they're adorable she's got 23 profit margins and i mean there are businesses that have that but before it being virtual and i mean it's just poorly run yeah it needs a massive overhaul um it sounds like a lot of stress i'm not interested in a lot of stress yeah that's the biggest thing i as much Such as somebody's mission excites me is I'm not going to go into somebody else's home and and stay there if it's chaotic.
00:40:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, and what I love what you just said, that's where we're down, honestly, like my energy just increased. I don't even notice it because it's like how refreshing will be able to say on a podcast or videos. Hey, if you if you have a business that's doing over $50,000 a month with 50% profit margins, we can help you. Boom, like it's that crystal clear, you know, and because I've been frustrated with the calls I've been getting over the last two weeks because. And I created the situation because I did three months ago, the 2k offer and then the 997 a month. So let me turn the box around silent. And yeah, I'm just like, the hell, I'm not going to work for you for for free or like especially with that one lady was like, why don't need a coach. I actually just need someone to implement stuff and she needs to figure out how to move her stuff to go high level. I'm like, I'm not your gal. So it's just like, I don't even know why I thought the pocket CMO COO doc was pretty clear, but then when they get on the phone with me, they want me to implement. That makes sense?
00:41:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it might be that they're mixing old offers with new ones and just thinking about something that they were already sold on in their mind before. And then you became top of mind again, but we feel the old offer. Now, they don't have to have those kind of mop, or the bigger the company gets, the less likely those margins will exist. So, you know, nothing lower than 30 if you're at 100 k a month. I don't want to, I'm not going to be there if it's less than basically it's about how much, how much money is being made and set aside. So 50% profit margins of 50k, there's, there's 25,000 left to be investing in people and teams and systems and ads. there's a reason that I said that specifically. Now, yeah, so it's, it's about knowing that you have enough to pay my fees. Yeah, plus ads and other people. So it isn't just a random number.
00:42:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So, okay, so let's see what else you sent us. Um, did she put this in frickin Googled?
00:42:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, she says she used a computer, right? Oh, that's a no.
00:42:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would not work with somebody who doesn't use She typed this app.
00:42:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She sent chat GBT. Before she dropped that in, she says, I'm gonna go to chat GBT and get you something. So I think she did that there. Which was interesting. don't use Google Docs or have a computer, you chat GBT. Like that's, I don't know. Oh, I don't know how old she is, but she didn't do
00:43:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Brianna, she's in her fifties for sure. If they used to do the road tour of all the female singers back in the day. So, oops, showed. I know it's a little ugly, but, um, and then she gave us access. Let me know. I'll write to Marima partner to be on the call and give you access to everything and talk you through how we run TTM. Well, thought that's what the call last week was about, but took three hours. Here's the free community. Oh, I thought she gave me access to the community.
00:43:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So another requirement I have, Maria, that the so because everything that I was about leverage and optimization. Yeah. I. I don't work with anybody that is, um, not focused. I don't know if she wanted and she's not focused. She's focused on her goal and her mission, but not when it comes to structure and organization, like her mom doesn't, didn't even want to charge money. And she's like, I just like, she, she's focused on a huge number of revenue, but not margins. She didn't even know what her margins are. So what I won't do is teach somebody who's making that much money, business values, and act like I'll train beginners that stuff, not one on one, but through courses, right? But I'm not going to teach somebody who's already responsible for other people's lives and making millions of dollars, the fundamentals anymore, because there are that will work with me that I don't have to do that with. Like, there are people who are making millions of dollars and want the kind of help you and I have because they want to go further, but they're not a giant mess. They just don't have the person who will also, like they're leveraged and optimized in their brain, but they don't have anybody else who will do that in the business for them. So they have to be that person.
00:45:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
00:45:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When she does, she wants that, but the positioning would have to be incredibly clear. This is what you get from us. It's going to cost X. We're going to do this a little bit and your team is going to have to do the rest of it. We're basically going to tell you what should happen, give you the targets, help make sure everybody's clear on why we're doing it, how we're doing it, and then other people will do it. We will not actually do the work. will, you get our brains. you get our experience, you get our leadership, but we are not the operators.
00:46:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I am not anybody's operator. Yeah, I think that's the shift that I'm going through now, too. And that's why I find it interesting because some people like still want me to be their operator, you know. So yeah, um, available. Yeah. So, so it's still one core problem or problem.
00:46:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Brian Moran offered me 30% of a new company if I would come down to Austin and run it for him. But I don't, I'm like, I'm not interested in that kind of like this work.
00:46:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
wouldn't want it.
00:46:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, tell me Tina, everybody has a prize.
00:46:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, you're set to douche back. You don't use a douche bag, yeah?
00:46:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. So, plays nice and tries to wants to be liked, but anyway.
00:46:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, um, what, what is she at the end of the day? So I'm in the, I'm in the Facebook group. This is breastfeeding, so we're in this group right, breastfeeding out. Like, there's two groups. is your question, please? One thing we would need to know is what's her org chart?
00:47:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I know she doesn't have one, but she'd need to create one. Who's on your team? What do they do? How much do you pay them? How many hours a week do they work? How good are they at what they do scale of one to ten?
00:47:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you want me to ask her to do that?
00:47:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, if you have any interest in working with her, you need to know those things. Because that's an asset you need to know. So, like, if you're not going to be the operator, somebody else is. Who would you be working with?
00:47:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, can you send us an org chart of your business and what their roles are?
00:47:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who works for you? First names, last initial. What are their roles? are their and Where are they located? How many hours a week do they work?
00:48:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And In words for you, including these include subtrumptor everyone.
00:48:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. We need the names so that we can differentiate between people when we're looking at it. And know that, you know, like, if one person occupies two spots, we need to be able to tell.
00:48:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What are the roles and responsibilities?
00:48:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where are they located? many hours a week they work? Yes.
00:49:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do they work?
00:49:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How long have they worked for you? Scale of one to 10. How good are they at their job?
00:49:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anything else?
00:49:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What has your team consisted of in the last two years? What people were here in the last two years that are not here now. Why are they not here now?
00:49:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So what has your team consisted of in the last two years?
00:49:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh-huh. That is different than what you have right now.
00:49:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Who's missing?
00:49:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're left, Who's missing and why are they missing? Because this is going to eliminate leadership issues.
00:49:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You mentioned one part in the moment. Okay, so I thought I had this opener messenger and it went back out, I like looking at one's bigger.
00:50:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The other thing I know we talked about it last week and I just want to reiterate it is that she's not doing us a favor, bringing us to the table of big deals. Yeah. You would be doing her a service, giving her the ability to actually handle the big deals that are coming her way and not tank them. There's no lack of opportunity to get money. is a lack now, but there are limitations to what we say yes to. If you wanted to go sell your soul, you could go find lots of people who would throw tons of money at you. you wanted to go burn yourself out, you could find lots of people who would throw big money at you, Maria. You know that. You don't want to do that anymore. No. That's been part of. probably a big part of the issue with their dad being gone is that there's something that happens when we lose people as we start to realize how fragile mortality is and how short it is. And so we want to spend more time with the people that we care about and we are more with their you were conscious of it or not. We're more conscious of the fact that you don't want to spend your time in places that steal from you the life that you do have. And so I don't think you were super like surface level conscious of that but I think your heart was like I can't. I don't want to do that stuff anymore. And even with what's her name? Boutique. Karina. Yeah Karina. Even with that like I think that that was probably more about I mean business business and you like business but also it was about relationships.
00:51:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
know you care about people
00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that you work with partners and friendships. so that was the thing that your spirit is like, I need to like the people that I'm working with. And that was there. But then you weren't being honored properly. I know she had real issues, whatever. She wasn't holding up front of the bargain. So now it's just kind of realizing that there are trade-offs that are acceptable and trade-offs that are not acceptable. This is what's becoming clearer and clearer to you on a daily basis. And so these opportunities, but people even like Joanne, that's not super clear too, because she hasn't figured out what she sabotaging with her chaos or her, I want to make 10 million dollars. And even though she said I want to double the rate of breastfeeding, the thing that she repeated multiple times was 10 million dollars, 10 million dollars, 10 million dollars. You only said, I want to double the breastfeeding rate once. And that's when I asked what the goal of mission was. So the thing is she's actually focused more on the financial goal, according to her own language and energy, then she is on the mission of doubling the breastfeeding rate.
00:53:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I do find it confusing how to help her at this point, like, you know, I'm really thinking that it's probably not a good idea.
00:53:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
think probably the best thing that we could do is, and if we were willing to be benevolent enough to do it, go through this together and say, okay, here's some of the things I would ask.
00:53:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let her answer the questions.
00:53:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If she answers the questions that we gave her structurally, go in and say, look, the best thing that we're willing to do for you right now is give you an audit and we will make a recommendation, which is basically the COO CMO kind of pocket, but modified for her, which is an audit and these are directions we think you want to go. Now, if you want us to implement it. Here's what it's going to look like. It's going to cost you and we're still not going to manage it. We'll help you find an ops manager if you don't have one or project manager. Otherwise we will lead guide and train your manager. It will cost a lot, you know, because we're going to get our $500 minimum hourly and and something like that. But I think that that's all that we do is we give her structure and guidance and potentially train one of her leaders. And and that's just and it's truly honestly it's benevolence whether and if she doesn't see it that way and doesn't want it that way, that's okay.
00:54:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Bye.
00:54:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look, everything will be fine. You'll find your people and we're glad to have talked to you. It's a great mission to have. But we have our own missions and they don't particularly align.
00:54:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So it looks like they have the Thompson products. Like it's very weird like I don't even know what. funnel is right it's it's it's just one thing Thompson method for looks like one hundred percent off so it's probably two four seven always on sale she said all like once a month or something once every other month to bring in the cash which then makes it she could probably get to her 10 million by cutting that price in half well this uh this is what she says it for now whatever the price is if you made it because most women especially brand new moms who are learning how to breastfeed in the first place that's where they have a poorest when you're young and having your first child oh so you think this is too expensive hundred twelve twenty Canadian it's not that I don't think it's that valuable I think that that if they cut they could offer it to more people so there's different ways of scaling right um one of them is getting more cut
00:56:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Customers the other one is getting less customers more priced now. I don't know what the the support level is And I don't know if that's feasible But I do know that this particular thing is something that is more important at one season in life And that's your first baby And now I needed all the way with every one of my children because I never got it figured out So that's that's not the limitation, but it's most needed with your first baby And the first baby is usually when you're youngest and poorest So taking that into account in the market What happens if you reduce the cost? Yeah And you could even call it like a first baby special whatever doesn't matter if it is or not if somebody wants it and it causes them to convert We don't care for it's your seven baby.
00:56:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know Would a mother notice The order bump is discover how to safely collect in store of Colostrum and dr. Rob is masterclass for just $24 and learn whether it's the right to
00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
choice for you and your baby's well being what is colostrum like so when you first when you're before your milk comes in um you and even while you're pregnant you ooze out colostrum which is loaded with antibiotics cows have it in fact i don't know if you've ever heard the supplement called armora um they sell it because now they get it from cows and people take it as a supplement so it's but but mother's colostrum is loaded with the most powerful vitamins and antibiotics for the baby to improve their health but once your milk comes in there's no colostrum it's just milk so but you get colostrum all throughout your pregnancy every month's different but i've never heard about storing that that's not a normal common thing you might be able to youtube it but i'm 48 half four kids and two grandkids and i've never heard about or thought about storing colostrum
00:58:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, what I'm also thinking is, is that, um, that order bump is probably terrible, uh, converting right now, because in the way that it's listed, yes, well, yeah, I don't even know if that should be the order bump, maybe some other different order bump, like for $7 something, like even maybe a meditation to calm yourself while you're pregnant, I don't know, but just I don't think a confused mind says no, and I don't think every pregnancy will know what the hell that is.
00:58:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, um, I think they will, yeah, if you've studied anything about breastfeeding and got to the point that you know that that's the first kind of milk that comes in, and it comes in before milk, also a lot of women will leak it, and that's one of the signs that they're even pregnant, um, before they have babies, and so they're like, what is that, and then they go ask the question and they learn what cholesterol moves. I knew I was pregnant two days after I got pregnant, way before you could go, because of that. were just so sore and they were leaking. I was like, what is this? Milk's not supposed to come in now, and my mom's like, that's colostrum. And then I knew the difference when my milk came in, because I was rock hard, it was extremely painful. didn't know could get rock hard, but they just like overnight milk came in, and it just was so painful. Like, have you ever had any part of your body be so swollen that you could, like it was shiny and you could just feel the pain of the swelling, just the swelling, not an injury per se, but just swelling? Yeah, my knee, but it wasn't shiny, but yeah, my knee. Yeah, so that but breasts. Terrible. Have you ever tested different price points and what are the conversion rates over those different price points? Are you late for a call?
01:00:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
She's okay. Well, this will be interesting because if she doesn't give us all this information that shuts the door on spending even more time on her, right?
01:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yes, exactly. And I think that what's probably going to happen is she's going to Um, this is, this is, this is my thing is I get, and I ask a question, whatever. people like, yeah, no, never mind. I'm like, okay, that's fine.
01:01:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know, yeah, I think, I think if I could go back in time, I probably would have told her, let just just pay a six thousand off our thing, pay two thousand for, for like the first, um, you know, analysis, like all it, you know, that we'll do for you. Let's go from there. And then, cause right now, um, I'm not motivated to work much for her.
01:01:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, and she's already had someone to my time. I wouldn't do it for that. I'd do it for at least four thousand. So split two, two for you, two for me. It's taken too much, like this type of thing, a new business. You have to wrap your head around a lot of stuff. And you have to wrap your head and it's the energetic exchange with a person. That is very draining. That's not just showing up and doing work.
01:01:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
New people are new exhaustion. And so she, she, sorry, go ahead.
01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. there's a price to pay for that is all like I'm only willing to make a certain exchange for that.
01:02:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah and she she has the warning signs because it's sort of like this guy I'm talking to at 5.30 today knows me from Ellen's tennis group message me and said the guy that built my funnel everything he's changing his business model so he's no longer running ads and working optimizing funnels so I'm left with out that talent is that something you can do can we talk and so boom we're talking and then right away he sends me the here's the funnel pages and I stopped running ads but if you want the conversion rates let me know so it's very like there's no energy drain like it's it's like okay let's get to it this is what I yeah yeah but without payment so just keep that in mind because it's also simple like did he pay you?
01:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know because he wants to talk about whether I do that kind of thing to help him okay okay like like just don't I wouldn't go giving away free advice whatever just I have seen people take that way very easily by starting to send you stuff and wanting you to look at it. That's taking your time. Like, I'm willing to do it on the call with you this amount of time. I'm not going to go dig into it. Your job now, if I'm talking to you is you're going to walk me through this on the call. not giving you any extra time other than the call. If we come to an arrangement on the call, then you pay me, then I'll look at it. But this calendar time I'm giving you is all I'm giving you until I know what you're going to pay.
01:03:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know what I mean?
01:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, there's just so many tire kickers, like, and you have to be careful. types of people, the funnel, you know, managers, or ones, whatever, but anyway, I just protective of you.
01:03:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Thank you. No, but you're right. Because yeah, when I was doing those free onboarding calls in Scoop Group, yeah, majority of them was bad. And I'm like, okay, why am I doing this? This is stupid. And that's why I made it five bucks a month instead of free, and you're in a min on it. And I changed it to business accelerator. or so.
01:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah. My, so I know you got to go. I'm just going to do this. I have a linear path. And to me, it is get our histories, like our pedigrees basically written and figure out what we could do with our existing products. What are the ones? How quickly could we get them repurposed into a tiny little package, a small little type of offer. But then with the pedigree, and here's what we've created, are you interested in talking to us about whatever, but it's, you know, the high level price. And instead of worrying about conversions, I just trust that the right people will come into that. And in the meantime, you can do the, you know, our consulting or whatever, but then you're not committing yourself to fulfillment. When you get off the call, you're done. You don't have to think about them anymore. But at some point, one of those phone calls will probably lead to Maria, I need you. You can be like, here's the price. And I won't do the implementation. But what I can do is, lead your implementer. And I can direct your implementer potentially and say, okay, here's what you should do. And this is what it will cost you and you keep that $500 EHR in the back of your mind always. So whatever price you offer is like, okay, well, talk to you for an hour, four times a month and it's $2,000 or $2,500 or $3,000 because you know they're going to talk to you throughout the week a little bit too. And so but I'm not doing it, I will give you the strategy. I will tell your person what they need to do. I'll help you set a base cab so that we can check every week that everything's on track and you get one hour my time. That's it, $3,000, $4,000, whatever.
01:05:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, cool.
01:05:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then you get your money and then you're not burdened and then we can build the scalable stuff as it goes. Love it. Okay, I'll let you go.

Hello friends, how are you? still have sick child. Yeah, she has to go to her dad's for the weekend, so I didn't get to mama and take care of her and give her other biddies so she'd get better. How are you guys?
00:00:32 - Patrick Shahverdian
So good.
00:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:00:35 - Patrick Shahverdian
Mm hmm.
00:00:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, was new. It's good guys. Take me.
00:00:46 - Patrick Shahverdian
We're at 600 something K and settlements for the month so far.
00:00:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Put my chair. Good job. I mean, things are, you know, going as they, as they should, good, come with some more detail than that. Come on. You know how much Mark pays me to meet with you, but for today, it's a skin in the game. Let's go.
00:01:22 - Patrick Shahverdian
I mean, it's just things are going as it's supposed to be like treatment is being done, getting a lot of policy limits, so that means the clients are willing to get the treatment that they need, which requires, you know, case managers to sometimes push them to get that treatment or explaining why we want them to get that treatment, which is good. And then, you know, obviously we got one big case, but that doesn't I mean, that thing slowed down. So I made sure to tell the team, firstly, I just ignore that it even gets settled. just try to act like we don't have. So we don't rely on that big one for the month, but yeah, trying to get to a million, but I don't know if we'll go in there.
00:02:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's the 15th path. We can do it. I believe in you.
00:02:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
How are you doing, Lorenz? Pretty good. Not having as good of a month as Patrick, obviously. But I'm actually pretty excited because a lot of those big cases I've been working on for the last year are either demanded or we're drafting a demand, or they're going to be ready in the next few weeks here to demand. So I'm going to start hitting some big ones here soon. So I'm excited about that. Obviously, the extended vacations everyone is taking is requiring some organization skills. Thankfully, Mary took pity on me and sent me Karen, who is a, we just hired her, think a month ago or something, but she's an experienced case manager. spoke with her today. We're going to be using her for as long as Mary will let us have her. So she's going to be sliding in to whichever team has a missing member at an given point, but I can definitely use her.
00:03:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. So let me open. I have a setting up a meeting so We have a guy that's been helping us with Lidify reports. When I started working with Mark, every time I would ask, where do we get this? We're, I don't know, there'll be a pain in there to get, like, I don't care, do it anyway. Anyway, so we found somebody who can help get us the data that we want and organize it. And it is a pain because Lidify is not intuitive is much money as goes into that. And as many people have their business on it, you would think they would do a better job, but no. Not optimized offers, I don't think. Yeah. So, but we're, we found a guy and he does a really good job at things. But now the process of getting the reports is kind of convoluted. so I need to get on a call with him and with Mark, which we're working on scheduling. So that we can. Get all the reports that way that I want them, including one for you guys, just to go look at that. Has the data that you should be looking at. I haven't looked at this yet today because I have a second. My baby is almost 15. And my oldest is about to be 24. One of my looking for Tina to bring together. Tina girl. It's not so smart sometimes. tell me. Reports. It's free. As for it. There it is. It's because I minimized my thing. Do you manage my team? What I want? Look at some numbers. Oh, yeah. And. I think. Mark told me that all of this isn't accurate, but it was close. What am I looking at? For October, it was this month. Refresh. Yeah, because what I see for you, Patrick, yeah, this can't be right, is, well, gross attorney fees by team for you would be 65,000. That's not right, right?
00:06:36 - Patrick Shahverdian
It's like an average?
00:06:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, gross for October.
00:06:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, Mark posted higher numbers yesterday.
00:06:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so this report is definitely not correct.
00:06:51 - Patrick Shahverdian
Sometimes he'll put three six.
00:06:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, so that's Right then, 65, 1, 6, 6, I have 0.4, but in the rounds I have 69,000 gross attorney fees.
00:07:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Should be, well, I got another 20 last night, so it should be a little higher than that.
00:07:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Depending on when the report updates might not show up. So, like, if Salesforce is on East Coast time, then 9 o'clock last night would have been cut off for the report for today. Or yesterday. I don't know how it cuts off anyway. Anyway, okay. So, now your gross attorney fee, what is, is that target?
00:08:10 - Patrick Shahverdian
Exactly.
00:08:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Huh.
00:08:15 - Patrick Shahverdian
I think the gold a million.
00:08:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For the gross attorney fees for the month. Yeah. I know that number, but that's that's I don't even know how. Um, is that all together? Yeah. Oh, okay. Okay. makes more sense. It was like these numbers don't make sense with that. All right. Um. Yeah. The other thing is we've got leads have been dropping like crazy. We're.
00:08:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Thank you Mark yesterday in Arizona.
00:08:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Super slow right now. Oh, where's my Monday report? What day do go? The, the, I mean, California is super slow. We've only had four for California as a Monday, seven for Arizona, 11 for Washington, six for New Mexico. So Arizona is not slow compared to what else is happening right now. Washington is saving us. And at one point, and this is where knowing the numbers really comes in, Mark was just going to not do Washington at all. And then we went and crunch numbers in his way. And he was like, oh, that's not what I thought. So we get numbers for a reason and we track things for a reason. All right, so what I want to do today, the first thing I need is an update on reports. I need to know how you guys have been reviewing your cases for our conversation. Don't all speak up once now, calm down.
00:10:24 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, no, I mean, I started doing three review meetings a week, like we said. We're on pace, we haven't finished the full year since we switched to that, the full case list since we switched to that, but we're on pace to do two reviews per case every month.
00:10:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Two reviews per case every month?
00:10:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, that's every other week, we review each case every other week.
00:10:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so you will get through your entire case load twice a month.
00:11:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good job. All right. So I would like you. This is an assignment for both of you. I want you to keep a log. We can put it in a Google Doc, a shared Google Doc. And I want you to modify it. Let's just start it right now. File new document. All right. Week of, we'll say, 10, 14. I'm going to share my screen real quick. Shouldn't I open the Zoom now so I can do that? Levantage away.
00:12:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
She's okay. She's going to start doing a stereo interactions next week. I was her mindset and energy going through all that. She wasn't too on board that night. She spoke with a doctor and she's eager to get going.
00:12:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Keep her in the prayers. I'm going to update that tempo roll for you. Let's see. Okay, I, my brain just went out the door for a minute and it was with the birdies chirping. Okay, we're at 1014. So update on case to cover all cases. So this this is zoom gets in my way. I'll just tell you with all those little things here. What I'm thinking, what I would like you guys to do is just so with the increase case review and the increase effort on looking at your operations. I want you consciously in the morning, every day, be thinking about. In the way that you're looking, so there's doing your work and then there's looking at your work, right? And I know that you guys are looking at it and kind of evaluating it and figuring out like, Patrick, I know that one of your thoughts is, how do we get to higher numbers, right? How do I be top dog? So the answer to that is always going to be operations. It's good, right? So you're having those thoughts. What I want you guys to keep track of every week is let me know what you've noticed two parts, what you could and should be doing operationally to improve things and results that you notice from things that you have started doing. Because when you come to the call, I have to extract that and most of that extraction process takes up the majority of the call where. as if you're taking note of it real time as it happens as you see it, then our calls will become more effective and then we can take that information and use that strategically, which is tapping more into my power and which is a better use of Mark's investment in our time together. So I need you every day to just be looking at it, just every time you're looking at things. If something, if you notice it, I want you to go, you know what? I'm going to write that down so I can bring that back to Tina as a, that's a win or something we should work on or whatever, okay? Is this one o'clock meeting time just too close to after lunch? y'all just like...
00:15:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Now I think we're with both Patrick and I are introverts and so it's hard to get information out of us. We're just...
00:16:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, whatever. I'm just going to take it personally. Don't like me.
00:16:06 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So whatever.
00:16:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not fishing for compliments. I'm fishing for energy, but it's okay. Um, okay.
00:16:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
want to get a hard time getting things out of me.
00:16:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I am an ambiver. So like, I perk up when I'm around people that I like and I'm engaged with. But then afterwards, I don't want to talk to anybody for like hours at all. Like play my game or go to the gym or like do something that doesn't involve talking to people. I really love it, but also it drains the crap out of me. And so like I'll go to church and I'm all, no, whole time. And then people are like want to talk or call or something afterwards. And I will literally look at the phone and go go away. You never really like them. I'll be in the grocery store and somebody I really We love it there, and I'm like, oh, just like, no, bye. Anyway, okay, so when does that get it? Anyway, I have a job to do here, so I have to extract the things. So let's go to this, this is a little, I was wanting to work on, that's not the right one. Okay, so remember this that we was working on? Do, do, do, do, Yeah, we're breaking things down. So first, talk to me and let me know, we'll start with you Lorenz, has this popped into your head at all as to like these other things that have to happen and just talk to me about if any thoughts have come to you about the conversation we've had around this. And if it hasn't, that's okay. Yeah. it has.
00:18:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. Yeah, you know, a couple of things have come to mind, especially, you know, it's always stressful when the CM takes a couple of weeks off, because we have to reshuffle the teens, but it also provides an opportunity to see what's falling through the cracks and what, where our blind spots are. And so, taking on some of Jessica's case load, I've noticed there's a couple of things that are not getting done. And so, I'm actually, I had a brainstorm session with Mike today, and we're looking at maybe having a sort of flowchart based on this spreadsheet right here, and have maybe as simplified the process to where, you know, it's like a decision tree or something.
00:19:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If he doesn't have a very high rating, sorry, carry on.
00:19:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Another thing we noticed is that we review cases and assign tasks, but it seems like those tasks get lost into the ether. I write them down in the file review section of the case, but unless I know which we talked about last time, sometimes those tasks fall through the cracks. And so John and Viri and I have been experimenting with the task workflow on Slack to see what we can do. We're still tinkering with it, but I'm thinking about rolling it out, team-wide. And that would keep the tasks alive, so to speak. They wouldn't be just tucked away into the case file.
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that workloads are very good. There's this, and then I wonder if there's a slack workflow integration. So slack has a new thing. Do you use, like they have notes and almost like a project management kind of built into it? you have you seen that?
00:20:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Is it? No, I haven't played around. I've been, since last week, I've been working really heavily on the $6 million demand. so I haven't had a ton of time to work with slack and the ideas that I've had. haven't had a ton of time to implement them, but that's the demand was sent last night. So I'm going to start tinkering around with it. Is that have you played around with it?
00:20:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, so I don't use it a ton. I mostly use it. check things out at a workflow. Create a workflow. I have not used workflows on any of that work. Choose an event. So, like, you could go through the whole list of things that we have. Now, keep in mind that when you're innovating, generally, you're going to have rework. You're to do it again and again. Almost always, when you're creating a new system, it's not going to be great out of the gate. Sometimes it will create more problems than it solves. So, you want to fix that as quickly as possible. The best system is the one that gets used.
00:21:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, right, I want to be kind of, you know, idiot-proof. I'm not, you know, I'm using the expression, not calling my team idiots.
00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But, Oh, yeah. Well, also, we've talked about mental load before, right? So the system should reduce mental load. Basically, sometimes all you might need to start with would be a flow chart, because what can help with the mental load is the visual of this is the checklist, or even just this. There's a checklist. So creating something that's just kind of literally like boxes right here, right? Where check it, is it done for this case? I don't know how you structure and organize everything and how you have it and letify. And that's the problem, is that there isn't that kind of function built into Linify. And like Mark, so many different clients were like there, they try to get away from using spreadsheet. But because it feels like we work, right? We've already got all the data and solidify, but it's not when you can do certain types of functions and those functions reduce human error and things falling through the cracks. So there are also, and these are things that as we're thinking about it, because I've never had this thought before, so I'm glad that you brought that to the table, things like Zapier, which is, it's an automation integration with workflows and it's almost an if this, then that kind of thing. So let's say we get a new case and the case comes in and so then Zapier could go say, okay, mail it to whoever and then check and automatically follow up every two days. Did you do this? Did you do this? this? And so it creates a reporting system, never thought.
00:24:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I was looking when I first got hired here. was looking for something similar to that.
00:24:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I couldn't find any free service. It's not free.
00:24:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'm not compared for it.
00:24:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
00:24:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:24:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, and he loves automation actually, and he loves smarter stuff, and it's not expensive. And what we potentially might get into is hip butt or just like privacy and compliance type issues. So that's a conversation. But it's a meeting with him and Chona tomorrow night. I have a habit of forgetting things. I'm just going to. Email. You know what, I'm going email him. just told him I might need to go talk about this. And I want to talk to you about the questions for an idea about the runtime. This is just so I don't forget. I had to remember which words had already come out of my brain and into the message. That's how special it might be. Okay, so I like where you're going with that. I think the first step would definitely be just having the team have something like this look at it. So you can copy this. And this is shared with you, right?
00:25:52 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:25:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's good. You copy this and just show them, hey, this is in modify, you know, anything you want them, don't want them.
00:26:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
see whatever and just go like okay so you how do tasks get delegated does it just come in and people know and they grab it or do you use make assignments yeah so a couple of ways either through your case I say okay this needs to get done this needs to get done who's doing this who's doing that and they usually you know say okay I will do this and I say okay can we get this done within the next three days and then I write in the file review okay you say then though like is it a specific person or you just put it to the team like if I'm talking to Mike and Jess and a case we need some hospital records. We need to follow up on hospital records. Usually that'll be Mike's department. And so I'll say, you know, hey, Mike, can you get this done for the next three days? And I'll put on the file review, needs hospital records, Mike, by this day, and then I'll initial and date it.
00:27:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me see if this is the right one or if it's a list. feel like it might be a list. But, um, well, I don't want to do it in here because she is in there. I'm just creating a new channel. Hi, Canvas. For templates. You Okay, ours might work. Let's do okay ours and see what we get here. I mean, you could completely rework this or create one from scratch, but they have, I like these also, the lists, you should explore this. So these are just basically tasks, follow up with whatever case, lot, whatever, and then assign a person to it, open item, you can put the status, you can put the date that it's due. And I imagine the workflows could kind of work like this, but If that is something that we could explore, I'm trying to figure out the best way to go about this because I love that you have this idea, how interested would you be in going Canvas and workflows? Do you enjoy that stuff at all?
00:29:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, depending on the length, I don't want to sit through a 45 minute video. No.
00:29:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
somebody can't explain it in five minutes, I bounce anyway.
00:29:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:29:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just to get an overall concept where you're like, okay, I can see a little bit about how to do this. I mean, if you're good at finding somebody, um, good at a chat GPT. Hey, my guy.
00:30:10 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
They have pretty good, you know, solution driven, uh, response. I don't love them for drafting, like, things, but as far as the technical solutions.
00:30:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, with two case managers and a, and a little assistance, we get approximately, we have approximately, how many cases do have?
00:30:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Uh, two, thirty-ish.
00:30:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We get approximately how many new ones a month, like six, no, ten, how many.
00:31:02 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'll you in a second, I'll just look at September, I'll look at September.
00:31:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The last Now, because this month we only got five so far. That's our do you ever use chat GPT?
00:34:06 - Patrick Shahverdian
I've never used it before.
00:34:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, we will break it down right now. Good question. Okay. Task assignment. How are tasks currently assigned to your team members? there specific categories of tasks you'd like to automate? Currently they are assigned manually through. I should say tasks specifically because. Are there specific categories of tasks that you'd like to automate? do you have a standard set of tasks that can be templated?
00:34:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Not yet.
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What we have this right I'm actually so I'm gonna do this one and drag it down No dummy Why did you be too? Whoa, it just happened Copy and pasting from Excel can be You Let's see, due dates, prior shows, do you have an existing system for setting up due dates, due date, systems, non-existent, really, just effectively, we don't have a super structured, you check, you look kind of thing.
00:36:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I'm the structure system.
00:36:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Prioritization, how flexible are these deadlines? Okay, so I do have target timelines for how long tasks should take as well. As as order. of past dependencies, and minimum contacts from, will say, maximum, um, and between contacting clients, and then if you don't talk to them, when else, Patrick? If you've gone or you just dipped up on your video, because you should be paying attention to this also, I mean, if we don't talk to them with, I see a chap or something, sorry, need to take this call, okay cool. If we don't talk to them within a certain amount of time, we need to follow up with them. Okay. Tracking a reminder, if you prefer Slack to handle reminders, or do notifications automatically, would you like to manually set custom reminders for each task or their specific intervals? It wants to set the reminder, timeline frequency, parameters, and then have it be automatic via Slack there. What key performance indicators would you like to see in the reports? Keep the eyes. On track back. That's about it. How many days over. do would also be good. Want to improve the overall speed. Closing cases, Instagrams with other tools, no other tools integrated. Actually, we use a program called Lidify. Right? She's a sales force. I want to track clients. Automation scope. Do you want to automate the creation of recording tasks? I want to use as much automation. As is prudent to accomplish my goals without over complicating the process or creating too much dependency on tech. The goal is save mental workload and time. And improve speed of case resolution. We have answered all the questions.
00:40:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Good thing for a minute.
00:40:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You hope.
00:40:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I hope I hope the reason he has to take that call is because he's getting that 500,000. I'll see.
00:40:51 - Patrick Shahverdian
Now. State Farm being a B.
00:40:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
State Farm being state farm.
00:40:58 - Patrick Shahverdian
Now that adjusters. running from you know They used to call me every day when I wasn't ready to like present the case and now that I'm ready.
00:41:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They don't answer the phone Task on it it deals very art of warish. You'd be like, have you ever every day Every single day Did it get it? Okay Task templates we can set up reusable templates for each of the 20 main tasks you had on the case This will allow you to quickly assign tasks for team members with predefined due dates and reminders Task dependencies Incorporate task dependencies to ensure certain because like you've got and I'm sure you know what task dependencies are But some of these can't be done until other ones are done. That's the task dependency So just just a rule in the same page Setting up automated reminders to find standard timelines for each task category or to police report two days prepare demand letter Look at this. I already like using our step and put in and in here, KPIs because we already did this, this is the thing about compounding how step builds upon things, right? So having clear definition and putting the tasks with accurate language in there has led to you having that brainstorm and us doing this. Everything that you do feeds the next thing that you do. Like one of these days we're going to get to the point where Mark's going to be like, holy crap, what just happened to the scene? Watch me. Watch, watch you. Watch y'all. Let's go. Okay. Define standard timelines. already did that right. So KPI monitoring reporting, basic reports, which is all I expected. Use Slack integrations or other reporting tools to show the status and trust tasks on track, off track. Overdo monitoring, automate alerts, that's to do that integration with notify tracks, key client case, and see if it can connect with Slack. don't know. We should have known that already. So if it doesn't know, it has some plates. Would you want these templates to include pre-set due dates based on typical case timelines? Oh, we're going to refresh this because it broke. I'm good for breaking chat due to day two.
00:43:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Do you have a paid version or the free version?
00:43:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Boy, please, do I look like the free person? Whatever is available, I'm getting it when it comes to technology, because, yeah, my guy, though, he's so funny. He knows I love tech, so I was, I don't remember where I think I was in Vegas, and I went there and he rented a car for me, and I don't even remember what it was, but it was super high tech. And he's like, yeah, because I know you love technology, yeah, do you understand learning curves? I'm like, I don't know how to use this car. It's cool. But I just want to get where I'm supposed to go right now, like, you're like, yeah, anyway, you can just like. I don't want to take on a person. I mean, you can't even give me time to play. Okay, create task templates, develop reusable, a more of direct, blah, blah, Automation triggers. Yeah. Okay. And wait, oh, you're asking me questions. Why? That's too much work. Um, so I don't want to answer any more questions. Um, what can you do to give me something I can do to slack, to get going right now. This is how Tina operates. What's the shortcut, homie? I need it.
00:44:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
This is the workflow builder. Click create. Set a trigger to the triggers.
00:44:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have anybody? Do either of you have anybody that's nerdy that would like to, like, play with this and set this up?
00:44:58 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah, Isaac.
00:44:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Isaac. Isn't Isaac like on paternity leads?
00:45:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, is he already?
00:45:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know.
00:45:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I know he's going on paternity leads. Are we gonna get a set?
00:45:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think part two. Yeah. I don't. I don't. That's not the easiest role to fill. Mark still calls him Noren sometimes and Noren was the dude before Isaac. So I'm like, stop that.
00:45:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's so rude. It's a such a nice guy too.
00:45:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have to tell Mark to behave himself multiple times a day. So he's like, no, I'm like, did your last name is sweet? Just try it. No. All right. Um, it's good thing he tolerates me. Go to work. I don't want to do that. Yeah. So we need somebody. So explore Zapier and Salesforce integration tools. So I don't think that exists. Just starting with Slack, using the workflows as and the reminders should be a really, really good start. So showing your teams, okay, really keep in mind and frame this with your teams, look. And I love to start with a question. Do like, and everybody gets paid differently and their incentivize differently, but like, you would ask them like, how do you feel about our monthly goals? That's very open-ended. And they'd be like, what do you mean? How do you feel about our monthly goals? It's okay. They can be uncomfortable. You can just sit there and stare at them until they give you an answer. Be okay with that. It's okay. Don't leave the question, just let them. And they'd be like, you know, they don't say anything. So then the next question can be, do you want to help the team hit the monthly goals? How important is that to you? Now watch them. Be honest. video call or be in the office with them because their face will tell you the real answer. If they are like, you know, make that little micro expression of just like confusion if they're level dot, like they don't immediately say, obviously I want to do it, right? Then they're like, man, you need to know that. You need to know that. Okay, because if that's not incentivizing them, but then you need to come at it from another angle, like, knowing that hitting our goals is a requirement for all of us to have job security. How interested are you in hitting our goals in order to not have to worry about having another job? Now, frame that the way you need to by the person that you're talking to, okay, don't use my language. But
00:48:01 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That sounds very threatening, like inspired.
00:48:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, okay, that's what I'm telling you. Look, I don't have the time to think pretty. know you guys can do better. Don't talk like me or people will hate you and be scared about your jobs. They're jobs. Okay, so don't do that. Yeah, anyway, I'll ask GPT before I have please reward my my this sentence so that people don't feel threatened with their jobs, but Here's the thing though, they're grown-ups and you have to realize that your metrics matter and your ability to hit the goals matter. They're not random goals. There are profit margins involved in the business. The goals are set based on the profit margins. Okay, a lot of money is spent on marketing and a lot of money and excessive amount of money is spent on incentive program. It is not super- for profitable this model that's here. these goals are very important. Now, the goals, if everybody is rowing in the same direction in the boat, we get there faster and better, right? Yeah. So you, I'm giving you the overall conversation that needs to happen. You have to finesse it with your people. Don't be like, Tina said to do this and I'm like, everybody wants to quit and they're scared blah, I'm not, no, I have a recording. I did not say just go, don't do it. But you want to read them. You want to have a conversation and read them and know how interested they are in hitting the goals and making things work well. Now, if that angle doesn't work, the other angle is, you know, how much would you like to see things go smoother without really having to put more effort into it? How would you like to kind of just reduce them, the mental load of the... the job but still get things done and it's a little bit easier. Most of people would say yes. The reason that's important is because in the beginning this is going to seem like more like a pain in the butt. Systems and organization take setup and they take getting used to. Old dogs, new tricks, that kind of thing. People just tend to not want to do it. So you want to frame it with ultimately this is going to make less work, less stress, easier to get to the goal line without sitting there going wait what should I be doing. You'll know exactly what you should be doing when and why and how you're doing. But also when somebody is sick and when somebody is not there, everything's already assigned. You've also got historical data about what's been done and how much has been done. It will help you with reviewing your team in a good way. It's saying like, man, you've been doing awesome. All these tasks, because I've been done on time. And then you'll also be able to look at, because you can go and alitify and see, you know, what's the average days to close, or resolution, and give them that and go look at that. This is improving. Patrick, you're still new, but, you know, you'll be able to look at that and just know what your targets are from the beginning once you start separating and having your own cases, not any mixed with Mark, whatever. Like, your day is kind of dirty in the beginning, but it'll be really good. So, but in order to get people to not be negative and go, you know, talk, and also the other thing that you should tell them, like if you've got problems with the issue, you need to bring it to me, but what's not okay is to go murmuring around and being negative about these things. So. So yes, it's new. The point of it is to make the job easier, easier as for to cover each other when somebody's out, and less like trying to keep track of everything in our head and just kind of see how we're doing. Like unless you're the kind of person that just like, hope somebody's looking at your work, then you're probably in the wrong firm because that's not how many things here. So anyway, I think you guys should have that conversation and then we should find somebody and it could be one of you guys, it shouldn't be that hard. Or we can set our next conversation next Tuesday and we can go into Slack and walk through this and do it together, set it up in one account. then if we can duplicate it to another one, like maybe create, I don't know, new channels. I don't know how it would have to go. We'll figure that out as we do it. But worst case scenario, if you don't have anybody that you can deputize, you'd be interested in doing doing this. And Isaac, if Isaac is around and he would like to do it, that'd be awesome. Especially because he can, he can share that with Mark and go back and forth there. But this is a great idea. This is a perfect follow up with this conversation that we had. And really could lead to really, like I said, reduce mental load. Because you're visually going, this is where everything stands. And automatic reminders and follow-ups. You don't have to sit there and follow up with your team constantly. Slack is doing it for you. And then you get to see, well, are they doing what they're supposed to? Are they checking it? Now, the other thing that will happen is Slack notifications are going to increase. So that can overwhelm some people.
00:53:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That is the one thing I want to be careful with because we did have let-ify notifications. When I first came in, every time we open the case, let-ify- And I think it was like 22 different emails for tasks that needed to be done for case opening. And so every single case was 22 emails.
00:54:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so eventually, no one even looked down. Right. So you can modify how the notifications work so that either they can disable notifications on there and just manually go in and check their stuff. You can do it so that it's push notifications, but not email notifications email notifications, but not push notifications. There's all kinds of different ways you can set it up and on the on the company level, but as well as like in the way that you structure the reminders and the alerts as well as the way that your people have it. So how they get notified is totally up to them as long as the job. gets done. If they're not getting the job done, then it's an issue, right? And also, all of these tasks already exist, like mentally, these notifications should be happening anyway, like, hey, you got to do this, hey, you got to do this. This is the nature of the job. There is a lot to do, a lot of cases, a lot of clients, a lot of tasks within it. So the reality is this already exists. If their preference is, I don't want to see it because it's too much, you know, that's a problem because this is the job. So that's another way to look at it. Now, you can have it set so that maybe you only get pinged if something's overdue or maybe you only get pinged one time per case or whatever. I don't know how it works. Again, we'll have to modify it and you can let people know that. Meantime, if they're getting overwhelmed, they can snooze their notifications with Slack, and they can just go in and check under their little red alert tab, right? they've got going on. This will be, so the goal is to work through the system as quickly as possible. So all the feedback that you get, like having them, I give you actual real feedback, not complaints, right? like, not this sucks. Okay, this sucks. What's a better alternative that you can think of? You bring a problem to the table, always also bring a potential solution. Okay, you can bring all the problems you want to, as long as you also bring a potential solution. Otherwise, it's just complaining, and anybody got time for that? Yeah, I told you all this one of them about that already. Yeah, anyway, you ain't trying to solve the problem. You just the problem, and I ain't got time for problems. Now you got to go. I just spent some time in the ghetto every now and And then it comes out, and my girls like to tell me about it. They don't even know how much I hold back. Like legit, get it. Like I go on to English class, and my friends are like, yo, check this out. He's got a nine millimeter right here. I'm like.
00:57:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
What?
00:57:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that was my life. Like I had a friend, as soon as I moved out of there, she got shot in the head by some gangsters because they were just out hanging around. And these guys from Houston, they were bad news. And then a few weeks later, another one of my friends, who was like, he was a star people, basketball, phenom, and like on a role student. And he's in prison for life because these guys shot somebody and said, you're going to take the blame for it. And if you tell anybody, we'll kill your whole family. So nobody ever said anything. That was a fun couple of years.
00:57:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:57:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, so if you see some crazy, crazy. Come out. It's real.
00:58:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You're not coming out.
00:58:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
God put me where I needed to be so I could understand what I need to understand. And whatever. That's all it is. But every now and it comes out. So yeah. Anyway, um, this is great. Uh, Patrick, um, really do need you to calm down like I can't handle energy. What are you really impressed with this GBT thing? Well, that's what I was going to ask you like, what do you what do you think about this? Like, what's I know you're always thinking and I know you're engaged, but I would love to know just kind of your thoughts about today's conversation.
00:58:45 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah, um, I do know like, let's say we have like these, I don't know, 15 things that need to happen throughout a case. Like, it's like a kind of seesaw like this part of it starts to fall off and we remind the team.
00:59:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and make sure we need to do this and then that that's being done like perfectly and then the other side like the basic stuff starts to like get missed so it's like I don't know if it's something about you know being able to see it in order for them to not forget but it will help it will help a lot so one of the things that I think that whoa actually meeting myself um that we might do and again please frame this with your team and let them know that this is a work in progress that there is this is going to be probably really clunky in the beginning and maybe more of a pain than it seems like it's worth but if they will stick with it we will make a system that works well for everybody and it makes at least some improvement for everybody and from everybody's perspective if we're wrong about that you got a person that probably ought to go because really it should be something that everyone can get benefit from. The only reason that wouldn't be is one if they're just that negative or two, they don't contribute to developing the system. Meaning they've made suggestions, they've explained with some kind of articulate eloquence why something doesn't work, so we can figure out a workaround. But at the end of the day, things are falling through the cracks and not getting done the most efficiently possible. The goal is not perfection, the goal is progress, but progress doesn't continue to come without being intentional about it. You can't just show up and be like, hey, you know, I'm going to do what I do. Progress comes from strategically planning how to improve doing what you do, right? So that's what this is about. So to that point, Patrick, one of the. things that theoretically, because I've not used Slack like this, I have used lots of other project management suites. But I don't want to create a new application that you guys have to log into. So I love the Slack idea, Lauren, by the way, good job. And I love you, Brad, chat to me too. I was like, I just know you got to do that. I'm such a nerdy girl. literally be talking to chat to you in the middle like, okay, how do you write this? How do you figure out this? I had an hour session with my 14 year old daughter trying to plan her career because she's like, what's a good place that they have lots of pets, but not a lot of vets, because she wants to be vet. So we talked to chat TBT and it's like Aurora, Colorado, and then we were off to the races for like an hour. Anyway, hang on, Lauren, real quick. So, Patrick, what we should be able to get is notice a pattern like, like you just said, right? If we start doing this, then this dips off. We start doing this and this dips off. What you'll probably find is that just paying attention to things, so just thinking about how different operations have been for you guys just because you thought about it differently. We had conversations, it stuck in your head, it popped into your head throughout the week, you're like, oh, you know what? I'm going to go do this. That's what will happen with your team too. They're like, there's just something changes as soon as you create awareness. So there's the level of awareness of just, oh yeah, like that's a lot of stuff that has to happen in the case, and it has to happen with every case. And there's kind of like a timeline that has to happen, and then when you add in the fact that you're looking at your cases and Lorenz you're like, or either one of you like, hey, it's been three weeks, nobody's checked in to see and make sure, you know, client didn't die. Everything's okay. We've still got a number. that works. All, you know what I mean? Like, once a week, at least are hearing from us, Hey, we're just checking on you, letting you know where we're at. You know, nothing has really changed, but wanted you to know we're here, we're working for you. That kind of thing. You're doing that. Your whole team needs to do that. So the more visuals we have here, right, the more structure that they're looking at, if they can see the tasks and slack, if they can see the outline of these or all the things that have to happen, instead of trying to keep it in their head every day going, wait, what do we need to do? Like, did somebody leave me the correct notes about what I need to do next? Do I already know what I need to do next instead of sitting there for two or three minutes ago? Oh, yeah. The next thing is, out of those two or three minutes over a week, over each person, over a month, over a year, we're talking tens of hours at the very least that we're saving doing this. And that's on your best day. Sometimes people going to show up with a migraine, you got women sometimes are going be cramping. Sometimes and somebody's gonna be hurting, depressed, whatever, all kinds of things, right? The mental lag time multiplies at times like that. So this mitigates some of just the humanness and the weakness that we have. And but also really helps everyone to see how is the whole case flow doing, even if I'm not the one doing it. And again, if somebody's like all of a sudden, I'm gonna be out for two months. Well, what has Mike been handling? What's been Mike been on top of? like, look at all those mics. I got to give that to somebody else. Holy crap, know, like Lauren's you're going through this stuff right now. So it's a process, you get some insight with the insight comes some improvement. And also with the insight comes more burden to an extent because now you have a new awareness that, oh, we're actually to not doing so great on this. But overall, it creates lifts, it creates traction. And as you've seen, Patrick, now with chat GBT, you'll notice one of the things that we improve a lot is just the mental effort. We're reducing the mental load and leveraging the mental effort. Chat GBT, if we can use Slack, so you're not having to manually remind everybody, chat GBT, helping us strategically plan it. It's not real AI. It's just logic. If this, then not. It's got a database of questions to ask, but for the most part, the output is equivalent to the input. So if we ask it really good questions and logic, it's not going to come up with anything we couldn't have done ourselves most of the time, but it will get there much faster so that we can process the next question, the next step, and so on. And so, anyway. But At the end of it comes, your cases get done faster. More reliably, we should be seeing better incentive pay. also within, so timeline, roughly 90 days. It's going to be a pain in the butt for roughly 90 days. The first 90 days are lots of growing pains. It takes about 90 days to work out and create the first iteration of a sick, the first successful iteration of a project management system with a small team. I'd say 45 to 90 days. Okay, so bear that in mind. Think about whatever is important to your team, especially that this is going to help us a lot when somebody's not available or the team changes or you're just having a rough day and we can't keep track of everything. thing. The goal of this is not micromanagement. The goal of this is not to create more work. So ask them to have a little faith and try to be part of the team making the process better. Okay.
01:07:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Sounds good.
01:07:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good luck with those conversations. And then the notes. didn't share this with you. I need to share this with you. Where did it go? Which, which, I don't know where I put it, where the crap. That was on it. Oh, was it here? Yes. Okay. Share. What are you guys going to do? What's that?
01:07:51 - Patrick Shahverdian
Noted like things that we noticed that are good or bad during our reviews.
01:07:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, not just our reviews, but anything throughout that we Like, hey, this is something we could be working on or hey, this is something we worked on and it's doing good. And here's how I know it's doing good. Here's what I'm seeing. Just things that you're noticing about the overall functions and operations of the team. That would be useful to have a conversation about. Even if it's celebrating a win or potentially something that we could work on, OK? No. All right. Thank you for spending time with me. You little introverts. I like talking to you guys.
01:08:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I think you're awesome. Thanks for bearing with us.
01:08:35 - Patrick Shahverdian
I like that.
01:08:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I look forward to it.
01:08:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You have a good week, OK? You too. Bye. Bye. Bye, bud.

Oh, that's not good sound. Hello. Can you hear me?
00:00:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I heard that.
00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was really garbled.
00:00:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Don't give me that crap.
00:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's what it is, Dan. I can't help it. Are you there?
00:00:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
About now. I think it's because I was on Wi-Fi and data.
00:00:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can hear you. It's still a way. Not great sound quality, but anyway. I had to do this real quick. How, what happens, I mean, unless it's personal and stuffs Monday, that you couldn't come to our meeting?
00:01:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, I hired this dog trainer that Glenn recommended, because it's like completely transformed Glenn's dog, blah, blah, blah, long story short, the guy basically kidnapped the dog. So, I had to go to Phoenix to get the dog back, because his life fell apart. He had no car, he was homeless, he had no car, he's got some crazy girlfriend, she kicked him out. The girlfriend started sending me all these weird messages, and I'm like, is going on? He was supposed to bring back the dog on Tuesday, and he's like, I can't do it. like, oh, got to be kidding me. Nice. So, I had to fly to Phoenix and drive back to get Zinnia, and she's now trying. Right.
00:02:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
As far as I can tell, I just that's terrible.
00:02:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And so you and Glenn are talking again, friends or like, no, he, well, I mean, I do talk to him here and there, but you not me, Tina, I don't do emotional . So he had recommended the guy back in the fall and I talked to the dude briefly and then I just sort of blew it off. But then I was like, right, we get this other dog, like she really needs to like, I just need her to like, get a catch up. Right. So I'm like, can't train two dogs at once, but I'm gonna have to know. And the dude has like great reviews. I guess Glenn never told me this. Glenn told me this recently. the reason when I had like two trainers and neither one of them could really train Malu, which is his German Shepherd. And then Malu was like really fear aggressive. And he was also just sort of not, he was like, unwieldy. And then Malu bit Glenn's mother, she had to go to the hospital get an operation, like, and then that really freaked Glenn out. He's like, wouldn't they wouldn't let anyone come to their house. The dog got worse. So then he found this dude. And now the dog is like, it's a different dog. It's like the dog's like, everyone comes over, we go on walks, no, no more fear aggression. You got to go to the other. And I was like, Oh, yeah, there you go. And then Glenn sound like, other people to the guy. They all raving reviews. They're like, Oh, this guy's great. And then his online reviews are like five stars. So it's like, All right, don't mistake it.
00:04:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, that's wild.
00:04:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
wild. It was unfolding. I'm like, what?
00:04:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now I'm wondering, did your psychic tell you any of this was going to happen? Like not specifically, right?
00:04:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But it was this wild. I don't know.
00:04:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What a story.
00:04:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No.
00:04:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how much, how has been getting her and.
00:04:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it was like four grand to, like, I, when it's all said no, I'm like, but I, he had videos of her and she'd be doing all the things. So I'm like, all right, she is sort of and then he's like, the dude is very apologetic. I mean, I think he just didn't see it, but I'm like, best intentions, bro. it's like they don't mean a whole lot so I'm supposed that he's supposed to like do video call on Friday I'm like this is all for Denise this is not for me it's for her but but yeah so I saw videos of her like healing like a pro right next to him to do that with me so there's still a chance I did some stuff I was doing but the whole rigmarole of flying dude there and driving back yeah but that she doesn't bother me alright whatever that's what I gotta do I'll go do that I mean yeah that's you you choose how you handle things yeah yeah Eric was like I would be so pissed I'm like what's the point what it
00:06:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
point of being mad really about anything?
00:06:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
that's like, and then I wrote some really great lyrics on the ride home. So there you go. I was looking at them this this morning and then someone sent Dan Burks and a new song and I was like, oh, I think those are going to work. Here we go. So there you go.
00:06:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we're lining. Yes, that there always is one. I really always this one. So during COVID, I got my daughter access to masterclass and they had some dog training stuff in there and she did that with my havinies. It was a little punk and he so healing, sitting, staying, and there's something called door dashing like when the door opens, they run off the door and he doesn't do that anymore. So I don't know if Mario would be interested in training Zinnia and you're getting like an online thing.
00:07:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Because I got a different trainer for the puppy and Denise and Mario lasted approximately one lesson. And then they're like, I don't want to do it again. like, well, then I'm doing it because this is not happening. Yeah. I had an hour lesson with her yesterday and Belle did great.
00:07:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Aw.
00:07:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:07:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yay. Yeah. okay, good. We talked about last week, I need to, I probably should go back and remember that it, but talking about, I think I probably just need to do that because my brain is like not dialing into the details of it. And my AR notes aren't good enough about this section, but basically scope of support and creating an SOP for like you were saying, I don't remember who did it. I guess it. was Glenn, I think it was Glenn, where Vijay and Abhishek did things that they shouldn't have done and it was a lot. so how even did it get to them in the first place?
00:08:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, okay.
00:08:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So in reality, Bobby's the one that stopped because he kind of okayed it.
00:08:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So that's what I was asking is what's the routing process?
00:08:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
how did the ticket come in?
00:08:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Who saw it? How did he get to Abhishek and Vijay? Exactly. That comes into the desk. Typically, Bobby is the first person to get on any tickets. I never do. Sometimes, sometimes they'll tag me in for whatever reason. Eric, Sometimes it's tagged in, but usually Bobby's the first person to touch it. Maybe they're trying to get him or not entirely shown.
00:09:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Typically. So is that not even a standardized process? Yeah, I guess so because I asked you a question, you said typically Bobby's the one that sees the tickets first. so you said typically that makes me ask, is that even a standardized process who's checking and who's assigning and who's accountable?
00:09:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I think they all are assigned to him. So buy him.
00:09:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is the volume of tickets?
00:10:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, like, one a week, maybe.
00:10:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Glenn asked for something and Bobby said, okay, and sent it to Avishak and Vijay, basically.
00:10:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Not realizing what he was asking for was more than what it seemed. Because the framing of it was, oh, yeah, just take this funnel and make it that funnel. Bobby didn't realize, like, yeah, that's part of it. But then you also need a new calendar. You also need a new automation. also need to tell you also, right? So it was like, it was the behind this. It was like the underlying functionality that was time absorbent, not the, like, duplicate this funnel.
00:10:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So is part of the. the process be then if there's a technical request that comes in that whoever assigned it, like, let's just say it's Bobby for right now, which long term probably is not the best thing. But if it goes to a dev team saying, what is the scope of this, like, what is involved and if they say, okay, we think it's this, this is how long it would take, then whoever comes back and says, okay, this falls within your scope of support, anything beyond. Like, if you have additional requests or we find out that it needs more, how, I'm just trying to figure out how would we word the contingencies, the, the qualifier.
00:11:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So yeah, so Bobby's working on that.
00:11:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So he's like, and we had started this many moons ago, right?
00:11:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And it was like, this is included, this isn't. So if it comes in and you're like, oh, yeah, that's, you know, we could. categorize it at that point or tag it and go content update, you know, site update, content update, new page, right? All the stuff that's included is that. And then we do these other included things like monthly plug in and we're pressed like that's all non-request based. So if you look at the tickets that come in are three kinds. Update content, which is all we ever get from Mark or Isaac really. Customer support, like I just bought strong marriage now and I can't log in. So we handle that, we'll forget those but Rebecca actually does that so we have her in there because they have their own help desk person but she uses the centralized help desk. And then the third one would be, I mean an example would be length. thing, which to me would be new components. But you could also, what would also fall in that not covered category would be new landing page, new form, stuff like that.
00:13:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which I'm new name.
00:13:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, no, just very specific, right? a new content page? Sure, yeah, that's going to be an opt-in page and a new form, the most negative. What they were requesting was a new funnel, like straight up. And it was like a book, a call funnel, you could call it, right? was. Yeah, it was like, yeah, was a book, I would call it a call funnel, which we, they had one. So they were right and like, oh yeah. We just want to make another version of this, but there's no, it's not cut and paste at all. Well, I mean, parts of it on, they don't know that. So their interpretation of this cut and paste, whole thing done. And I think Bobby's interpretation was also cut and paste. Oh, yeah. And he just set to damage it to BJ. And then they came back, they don't question anything, right? They just do, which is very developer-y.
00:14:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, done. We're gonna get it done.
00:14:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And they got it done. And then it was like, oh, PS that took 10 hours. And Bobby was like, wait, what? Which in the grants do you know things? It's not that big a deal, right? Because most of the time we get zero requests from Glen and Ross. So we're just making 700 bucks a month, doing nothing.
00:15:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
except there an allotment of developer time that a person can have. So let's say all of the requests.
00:15:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, they get none.
00:15:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:15:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They only get what they get and there's no custom anything. There's no whatever. It's like, hey, you get these things. So, and there's no limit. Like, you could add plenty of new content pages, but no one's ever going to do that. So it could be later on, we change that button right now. It's like all framing and do like set it and forget it. Like, you don't need to be adding blog posts or if you do, you can do it or we can do it. So, those guys were, they'll also add like a product here or there and that's like super simple. So that's included. It's like, oh, they want to add. They always do some weird . Oh, you know, need a 3K 150 month. All right. Well, no, I mean, fine.
00:16:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a good perspective. Is there a due date for Bobby having this documented?
00:16:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I've missed the meeting on Monday, so I don't know where it's at. I I think his first line was just going to dig up what we already did. I feel like it's already done. We just didn't really. We got to figure out, like, I guess, in a way to help us do this. Hey, a call bundle takes 10 hours. So therefore, the price of a call bundle is 10 times the hourly rate that we already have, which I don't know at the top of my hand. I want to say it's like $90.
00:16:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I feel like I remember. like two years ago maybe that you had a price chart for hourly rates.
00:17:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yep we have it if you're looking somewhere and probably it's based on Abhishek and DJ's black quilts like Greg's.
00:17:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Anyways, of time right?
00:17:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah or they buy the thing. So we say okay it's gonna cost this. So some stuff you would just need little pre-priced. Hey a new landing page of form is this. Hey a new funnel book a call funnel is this. A new sales funnel, three steps sales funnel thing. And then we could have these things pre-built as important templates from the basis cloud library. just don't because we can't build them yet. Because that part doesn't work. Because the theme isn't done right?
00:17:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
guys are fixing another dragon.
00:17:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh yeah. My version of it, it's like, hey, we would have the Cloud Library template of, hey, this is a automatic customer funnel. But they're going to charge them what we're going to charge them, and the fact that we have a Cloud template, not their concern. We built it, we use it, you still pay 900 bucks or whatever it is.
00:18:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is named Frank back from vacation.
00:18:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think he got back.
00:18:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So he gave some deadlines of when he thinks the first thing will be done, but you think it'll be done soon. I'm trying to remember what the first thing was.
00:18:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I had it written down. He wants the wolf or site.
00:19:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, no, the first thing was to build the wolf or side on 2.0 Oh, you just like got really far away or muffled or something He wanted the wolf or site built on basis 2.0 But he didn't know it was already done.
00:19:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I didn't either. I was like, I think that's done But I don't I'm not I'm not gonna say that on this call And then I think I have to check me to let him know, but he was on vacation. So they were like, hey, we already did that So we're gonna go work on this stuff What's next? They just start working on the theme And they sent the code For review, I think they tagged in Nario Then they sent it to Frank. So ultimately Frank is like, hey, I want a code review before I get it and then when I get it we're gonna come in I get it and review it and it's good It'll get committed for there literally are waiting for Frank And does he have it Huh, huh yes, yes, okay, yes Or like it's in the get waiting Oh What's what's the status of brain tree and moving and all of that There Eric was all pumped So he thought he had it solved and then this morning reset you got hit again It's like oh well not solved But no one else is getting hit. It's just reset you now so that makes me think that Ross or Glenn's admin is compromised. So I was like they don't need to be admin. So we removed that like an hour ago and then I was going to look at one thing, but I didn't have a chance to look at it yet. We installed this, we installed two plugins, but one looks for attacks and the other, like, logs a bunch of activity. So they're, like, getting in through an admin, it should show up in there. But there's also the idea that they were already logged in. And they just, so then we just unlocked, we logged everyone out. It moves WP log in. So if they were going straight in, or were already logged in, now they should be logged out. And then if Glenn and Ross were compromised, they no longer have.
00:21:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that was one of the main things that I learned a long time is a long time ago is not have WP admin as the login, like, we would use secret link or something like that.
00:22:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
instead of it.
00:22:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that there are zero admin accounts like the admin default is changed to something else. So that anything that's default basically got changed to something else.
00:22:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and then prank was like you need to rotate your admin password like every 60 days. And we should use this thing called one pass. We don't log in. We log in through WP Manage or I do. So then I was like, everyone just needs to use that. We just change WP Manage. Okay, breaking up so bad and trying to figure out what you're saying.
00:22:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think I got the gist of it. He said change your passwords every couple of months or six months? 60 days. 60 days. Okay, that I was like, it sounded like two. I remember a six, okay, that was every 60 days and he said use one pass and you said you log in through Managed WPAs, WPAs. So you don't have to get rid of rain tree?
00:23:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Known at this point. Okay. Maybe it seems like a maybe we can if no one else has gotten hit, which makes me think that there's and the Presidium guys did find malicious code on reset. You and they didn't find any on other sites. So it could be that they're only able to get into that site through whatever backdoor they created.
00:24:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You Well, hopefully that gets fixed. Oh yeah, where are we at with more surf stuff?
00:24:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I just finished. We are advanced. No, it's not done. And halfway through is a Google analytics board. And beyond. But finished the first two sort of. The steps of. Yeah, like their. Valley and now I'm moving into. The next level. I'm doing the GA for one. Right now. and then he has like a GTM advanced that I'm doing after today probably and then uh there's like uh oh there's uh oh and then I hit up Melissa and was like hey are you out there she's like yes but i'm on vacation of course you are in european that's what you people do uh so she got back from vacation today maybe they all go away at the same time uh and I sent her all of his stuff so he has like two forces whatever right so he has like two it's really two videos he has two videos on looker from their kind of point of view and then he has um those reports his eye on the journey Report thing and they have all these graphics that are like pre-built for you that you can use start like hey Log in here. Watch these Then I want to build these reports. I set up a bunch of the events for it. I think correctly and then let me know when you're done and We'll take the next step. So shoot price started looking at that yesterday Okay Okay, so oh no, I'm sorry today today. She's back today Sent it to her yesterday What would she be doing is like creating your version of the report for you? Yeah, yeah, she's she does all of our GDS stuff So she built like that that screen cap I sent you the other day of that report.
00:26:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's all her You built that What screen cap of a report did you send the new subs and new cancellations? I don't remember seeing a report.
00:27:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, you didn't look then. And what's the report was like, there's like, there's a graph.
00:27:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yes, chart chart chart. Okay.
00:27:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So we have a bunch of different charts in Google data studio that are based off of blue data and gravity data. We don't have anything that's, you know, extending Google analytics or not Google on the floor. But she's our, she's our go to for that. And I think like, you know, it's going through this course. I set up the variables to do or to mail or get the variables and the parameters or whatever. I said all those up to be able to do it for two journeys. it's sort of the path. the journey path to purchase so which path will they go down and then just like the straight product journey which would be a product checkout purchase so those should all exist as data in Googling will explore now for like you know only like a week or whatever but and then they'll just continue to accrue.
00:28:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you describe those journeys again path to purchasing straight product journey.
00:28:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So path would be the go to the two paths page then they go down one of the paths of winner ninja only then they go to the product page and then they check out the other journey is that they start on the product page and then they check out or everyone that goes to the product page so even if they came from a path I just want to see hey what happens or project project page on and then I can connect to build three journeys so it would be path one path to and then like home page button to product page which is the probably the most popular way people get there.
00:29:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So is it like a I don't know like a goal setting kind of like with behavioral so I'm not referencing GA for because I haven't used it but previous google analytics you could map out goals and they had customer behavior where you could look at their journeys from where they entered this page this page. So no, what does this look like? Like in a layman's professor?
00:29:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah yeah so what you are talking about doesn't exist anymore at all. So everything in GA4 is event based. So, like of those reports, I'm firing events for those steps, but then in order to visualize it and see it as like a funnel or see a breakdown of people going through each individual step, right? let's say, hey, how many people hit the product page? Well, that event is product page, page view event. So, it would take that level and be like, okay, you had 100 people, this is the product page. So, instead of it being URL base, like it was in J4, you're using events and the reason you're using events is because they can only fire once, right? So, you don't have to worry about, oh, did this person come to get, right? The page views are not really page views, whatever, it's really like this many, it was 100 people, 100 events fired on this thing, conceivably. And then you'd say, then you have multiple events on the page. So, then the next event is add to cart, or the next event is, you know, you can have multiple events. so, you're doing, you're doing, we have a report based on the events. And then you can put it together by like, OK, event one is page view of path page. Event two is page view event of path one. And then event three is page view, obviously, this person above the priority, right? This page view of product page. then the next one is page view of checkout. And the next one is page view of purchase page. So then you could say, OK, show me that. Show me the breakdown of that in percentages. So he has like, one side is just like the numbers. OK, 10% of the people saw the page one. And 20% went to path one. And 80% went to path two. And then you can start. And you start basically right now, we're just establishing a baseline. Like, I need to know what's actually happening. And then. And then he's got some like, he says, oh, what's his number? He's, I'm going say his, he says that everyone's card should be 10% add to card. It's not like that. He's like, we've done so many sites and you'd average as 10% if you're not getting 10%. That's where you start. You should start figuring out why you're not getting 10%. So we get the number. And then we see, are we 10, are 20, are we 2? Then that's the right side of the screen. And then the right side of the screen is more of like an actual funnel visualization. And it's showing you going through the steps of the funnel, but his funnel is that those eyes, impression, interest, interaction, whatever the five eyes are. And then those events are separate events. could, you can have some of them might be like impressions is the same impressions, but then interest is hey, they scrolled and saw the variations or they, whatever you decide. So I don't have those ones set up yet, because I have to figure out what they are.
00:33:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I, I love this. mean, because how many times have you talked about how much the data matters and that's. Um, so does it have a built in heat map where you can see the activity or the equivalent through the events, like can an event be mouse over the cart button or, um, to a certain page or click or hover or things like that?
00:33:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So like one of his events for like interest would be, um, scrolled to make this up, right? And was at that location for four seconds or more. So then that event would fire. He's like that shows that there's interest and you can sort of Find these events right find those more specific events by Watching like clarity videos or whatever, right? You might go watch a bunch of clarity videos and go Oh, there are people doing this like I should I should track that. I should see You know, whatever whatever it is. I'm good example But your example is correct, right? You would define The add to cart button is like, okay, they or the for us it would be like the Drop-down menu of sections, right? like oh, went to this they stayed in that sections area for this long So they were thinking about it or and then or maybe you can find an event like they interacted with that menu That's gonna get more into this advanced GTM. That's part of a gun to that's where you start writing your own JavaScript and you're and you're firing events using JavaScript based on Thumbs up so but other stuff like scrolls already built in so you can Take the scroll data that's already there and then you're going to marry that with Hover and whatever that's not built in There's a bunch of basic stuff that's built in you just have to turn it on That sounds so awesome Yeah, he's definitely it's definitely been demystified. I'm like, I'm almost there. I'm like, okay.
00:35:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm starting to pick it up now That's good And I love that you had Melissa because with Google Data Studio like it should provided the the new framework right the user interface um is being understood she should be able to be useful in So you being able to say which is to me the main goal of you having enough of a technical understanding of what needs to be done in the business to hire and choose the experts to actually do the thing, work in the business, and also to be informed enough to direct them specifically to the most leveraged activity, which I think is, you know, like Melissa, you have Norio the code overlord and Frank and Melissa for analytics and Bobby for meeting management and conversation, so that is to me the way that, so I was, I started EMeth again because I have Mark and the guy who referred me to reading that, and so I was just, I'm like, well, it's been like 12 years, I should read it again, and I was looking at that going, I was listening, thing just in the very beginning and thinking about the 30,000 foot view that they start describing about what needs to happen in the business and then I'm thinking like why am I not out of business yet and other people doing this stuff and then I heard the thing and it was like this is always the issue with EOS, EMITH, with any of these things is that the work that I do and the way that it's work with are different is that we want the good business practices and the good business systems and it lines up with a lot of that but we want and prioritize freedom over time and who we work with above profits like for Mark his priority is I don't want to go to the office if I don't want to go to the even if I don't want to go in for a month. He wants to work, he wants to have his business, he wants to have it profitable, but come hell or high water, he's going to figure out how to do that without having to be in the office for a month if he doesn't want to go in for a month.
00:38:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's new.
00:38:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and that's why I'm having conversations, because I'm like, he's definitely not there.
00:38:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But I don't remember hearing that before. No, I definitely did not exist before.
00:38:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so it does. And the thing is that there are always trade-offs, but these trainings don't talk about human trade-offs and making anything that's other than prioritizing the absolute best health of the business rather than the absolute highest value of the visionary being that which is what I'm always going for. And because a lot of the times we do think like for you, it's pace. Like that is more important to you, I think, than well, then then profit, but so is no drama. So not feeling like things are stressing you out either because of the people that you're dealing with or making yourself go, you know, this is the deadline. It's the deadline. It's got to be the deadline. Realizing that deadlines are arbitrary anyway, really. It's this because we said it's this and it should be this, which is what happens most of time, the same with financial goals. That's what most businesses live and die by. And even an email, and he's like, and it's hard work, but it's worth it. And I'm like, it depends on who you ask. And how hard it is. Like, so none of us are opposed to work. We all work. We work consistently. something we show up all the time. But I think it's kind of almost the obsession level and the required discipline. Like even, oh, what's his face? see it. It's the profit profit first. Yeah. Yeah. What? So none.
00:40:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's creating a job.

Like, oh, I'm never doing that. None of these, to me, are the simplest forms of success. Right. There is always extra and and they talk about the 80-20 rule, but I don't think that they really understand it or they they just overcomplicate it because We really don't have to have that much organization and structure. The bottom line is what are your most profitable activities, effective hourly rate, that kind of math, right? And what are the things that have to be done in the business or it fails to exist or it diminishes that is tedious and takes the visionary away from the most profitable activities. Those are two massive leverage points. Number one, you spending more time doing the most profitable thing, which almost always is also the thing that people love most. That's why it became the most profitable thing because you loved it first and we're good at it, almost always. In fact, I have not seen an exception yet. And the other one is as quickly as possible and creating a path to this if it doesn't exist. all the other things that pull you off of that off of your plate on someone else's. Specifically, someone who can work autonomously and not need to be micromanaged or anything like that. To me, those are the first two levers to go after. And then systematizing inside of that. But mostly, it's just a huge awareness of the greatest value in the business, starting with human resources, starting with the visionary, depending on how small it is. And then a single person of support in the highest level. So like Seth Ellsworth, his biggest person would be a salesperson, or a lead generator. The next biggest person would be an automations person, because what he does is largely automations. For Mark, Mary, um looking in the documents or looking at some of the reports and managing managing the people being available frequently and then having attorneys over their pods just being better leaders has you know those are his leverage points for you a developer because so much of it is technical and then a person to track tasks and move them forward and not necessarily a single person in any of these things but those are leverages and so you know there are things to glean from email from bill to sell from EOS but yeah anyway just contemplating all of that and but but things like that so you understanding going for a full circle how staying on top of technology has been a massive lever for me is for you, too, because the technology itself is the lever. So GA for being able to provide so much data, but the first thing is you have to wrap your head around GA4 and how it works in order to unlock the gift that it has in its data. And knowing most people will never do that, most people are just kind of going in the dark because they don't have good data, they don't know where to get it, or they won't put the effort in if they do know where to get it. anyway, you just leveled our leopard game, that was a long way to say that's what you just did.
00:44:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, yeah, I mean, I think that, you know, I just come back, it's like, it's the age old thing. It's like, there is no system, there's no system. Not working a system and there's no system if you're not building a system. So I'm like, you gotta build the system first and then work it So I'm no problem and usually where people fall down is they never build the system So it's like, you know, you didn't set the weather. It's like he hasn't built the the way to get an automations person in there, right? and it's like oh, yeah, you're gonna build that mark but it's funny about mark is like The other day was like, hey, I think you need to start recognizing that and your right hand not Mary Here we go Salka's getting deeper and deeper in there.
00:45:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would like to hear more of that.
00:45:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What how He's deeper and deeper in there like he's interacting with Sam and Are you saying Salka is the right hand? Salka was saying that he said that to mark. He's like you need to Start recognizing that like I'm your right hand not Mary And that his right hand needs to be someone like Salko, not Mary, because Salko can go into an arbitration. Salko can go in and tell Sam, hey, no, you're doing that wrong. And like level up the things that matter. Mary's more like a ops person. It's like, no, should just be the, like, I think you just nailed it. Like, she's the one that should be looking at dashboards. That's not Salko's gig. You should be the one that's like, hey, your leads are down. Hey, retainers are off pace. Hey, but you know, calls going out is low, right there. But you know, our job, you know, is getting those metrics in place to be established and be then set that baseline and say this equals that. Therefore, if this is not happening, then that is not going to happen. And I think I actually had Josh did something with phone calls that he sent me. I haven't looked at it yet. Because I started, look, I started wondering about that. like, okay, if we can't track an intake person, which we can't, which I understand, because they don't don't get assigned the lead. That totally makes sense. It's like, well, they all do the same thing. They all make calls. So there's got to be a relationship between all volume and whatever, right? what was the differentiator about July? What made July different than every other July before it, right? Part of it was lead sources. But like, what even the best lead source hit the bend. So it's like, well, it wasn't just that, right? Like, and what's really great about it was like, in the mark three years ago, monkey did that to him three years ago in July. Totally different stories being told at that point. You're like five alarm fire, we're at, because we got zero retainers this month, right? like, he would have been like, so underwater. And I was like, no, that's not you can now have your best lead source totally crap out on you.
00:48:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, and you set a and you set a record. And that is the leverage.
00:48:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's a risk. Yep.
00:48:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're welcome. Mark. Right. Thank you. Because he's like, well, because he didn't even have a system for it. He didn't have a schedule for it. He didn't, whatever. I'm like, who goes and buys new vendors? do. do you do that? How often? Well, um, like, okay. Yeah. Yep. All these things. Um, hold on. Let me. Oh, you were so lead. Let's talk about mom for a little bit. I have to cut off right at one. Um, unless there's something else you'd rather talk about.
00:49:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Another Sunday one's just chugging along it's high season and we're just I'm it's all It's me just figuring out this the analytics piece is gonna unlock it all I'm about to ask ask Mercer my first question yesterday, which is something missing in their training some of their trainings old I'm like, hey, this doesn't exist anymore. I Don't even really need the thing, I'm wondering if they have an answer and then I'll get to this other bit And then I'm gonna hit them with my KPI. Hey Let's say I want to try new customers. I still got to get that answer But that's gonna be my big question for them. The rest all make sense And I'm just gonna go on the Legos in place. We just had an hour and a half long call about mom.
00:49:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So go. Oh Yeah, huh. Yeah.
00:49:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, got moved to today.
00:49:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Oh Yeah, cuz well our last call was an hour and a half also Cuz time flies I'm like I was this call almost was over already. Um, what was I? Oh, yeah. Okay. So another 71, that was kind of why I wasn't pausing on that because because of the analytics. And I already asked you about record stuff and just seeing what's going on there. But I haven't asked about mom in a couple of weeks, other than you know, was Mark working on the book. And I don't remember your answer, but basically they're doing other things.
00:50:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, the book is done. It needs to be edited. And then Katie comes back on Monday, so I'm going to yank around the side and be like, I need you to help me edit this book. So her and her husband will probably help me edit the book and then the book will be done done. So that'll probably be done hopefully, you know, next seven to ten days from Monday.
00:50:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, what's next?
00:50:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Then I'm going to revisit like all the all the checklists. So we had like a release checklist, that checklist, I gotta make sure all those are up to snuff, you know, as far as Greg goes, because I think he made one, but I don't think he made them all. Make sure those are done and then sort of revisit the mom's site and be like, okay, now let's make it really show what we do. So I was on a call with them today, and Sean's label wants to sell land, so they acquired Lansdown's catalog as part of being signed to the label. And now the heads of the label got ousted, he literally just texted me that because I'm like, what's going on? So they got, they were like, hey, you can buy your catalog back. And they want to charge them 250 grand, which I just went on Chats UPT for like a while, and I was messing around. The value of the catalog. like is way higher than that based on what Chechi PT was saying, right? Me going, Hey, how do you do this? How do you do that? What's a multiple, right? So I got to verify some of that stuff, but it, you know, as Chechi PT does, I'm like, Oh, that's not real. Like, I don't know if this is real, but. And then I was querying it, whatever. So there, there's definitely like a formula that you could use. So of course, Mark home, you know, home run, Grand Slam. Grand Slam is like, Hey, we could go around and start buying other outer catalogs will go get investments money and blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm like, no, bro, no, no, no, no, no, no. Like, why don't we go back to AFM, which is Sean's label and we make them an owner finance offer. So we buy lands down catalog back. It'll be money down into paying interest rate, firms with a payout by whatever, they'll get a monthly, a guaranteed monthly payment. And then we have some sort of bio clause that we can buy out whatever because my Arc was showing me and Spotify what happened with his band, so he's been playing around with Cross-McTill using some of the fan flowy stuff. And their streams are just like going up and up and up and up. But they are nowhere near as big as Lansdowne. And then this other band that we work with, they signed with a company called Amuse, which is sort of like what we're doing. And those guys went and started promoting non-point, and their streams started going up. And Amuse is getting a chunk of that revenue. So they're like, Lansdowne has better bass numbers than both of those bands. And what a shock Tina, Lansdowne has never used any of the fan flowy stuff. Because why would you when it's right there in front of you for free? So, of course, today they're like, do you want to buy Lansdowne's catalog of like no? But after I did the whole thing, I was like, wait a minute. Like, what if, Angela, what if mom bought Lansdowne's catalog, owner financed, right? Don't, none of this go out and raise capital because you're just inviting people in that you don't want around in 10 years. Like, so you go in and your owner financed it. And I, with GPT, I was like, hey, how long has Spotify been around? So I sort of came up with this custom formula that says, well, Spotify might not be around in 20 years. So don't give me evaluation on 20 years. But the calculation that I did give me, it was saying, which I do feel it could be pretty valid. just got to go, you know, find something. And it had like, oh, this source, this source, this source. So it might mean some tweaks, but, you know, over a 10-year period, it was saying that the stream revenue is worth, which is based on actual Spotify data, that it's worth 1.5 million. I was like, okay, so if we can come up with that formula and then we can actually figure out like what it's worth, then you could go do this with other bands. You go to the whoever owns the catalog and you just keep doing these owner fine hand steals. Like, hey, we want to buy this one for that and then you bring them in and then you put your promotion engine behind it and then whatever those numbers were, they're wrong because you're now going to increase all that revenue, but you're going to do it to an asset that you already own. So I like, all right, that's kind of interesting. That's like building this asset, like this recurring revenue asset that can go out 10, 15, 20 years and then God forbid, one of these bands breaks, like, all right, yep, we need to look into that. So we got our first there, Sean and Eric are setting up the staff stuff tomorrow. We're bringing on a DIY client, it's going to be the first person to like, just, he's going to pay, I think, $97 a month and he's just doing it himself. So what he wanted, he was like, when can we get access to this? he's going to be our little beta tester. Norio, I got to send him a video today. I don't do right after this. So he has, he needs some help with his. He's building this song lookup app for us that uses this service called song link. That's part of the onboarding that we have. It's part of the promotion engine that we need the artist to be able to quickly get all the links for all the streaming services by searching their song. He's building that, those search their song. They go, yeah, that's it. And then it will update like 10 custom fields inside their account. So they could do that for like up to three. So we promote retell them to pick three songs. So hopefully when I send him today, we're. Yeah. Hopefully when I send table, get him over the hub and then he's going to look at this DNS app that we might build is the biggest sort of hurdle for use or so far has been getting their DNS setup. They're like, OK, not going to go, daddy. Hey, person, there's no idea what we're talking about. Go in and add this MX record, that MX record. Oh, yeah. Yeah, good luck. So people are just borking on that. And Mark found this software that looks like it's exactly what it does. And they have an API and all that good . I'm going to kick that to my own next.
00:57:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll your MX records for what they need to be.
00:57:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It does it all. Yeah, it's just it's wizard or fives setting up all your DNS.
00:57:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you just give it like a registrar or something or how does it.
00:57:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. No, you give it your domain name and then using their app, you're already approved with like Wix. And like so many of these people are using Wix or bought their domain through Wix and then never built the site. And high level only works with like GoDaddy and CloudFlare, which some we had. Some people use GoDaddy, but, you know, if they have Dane, whatever, this, this middleware works with anybody. So then you, when you're authorized through them as fan flowy, then you're authorized to go in there at the DNS records on all those other providers. the person is just, you know, essentially. So like MailChimp uses them as an example, one of the big clients is MailChimp. So anyone that goes on MailChimp and needs to update their domain, they're going through MailChimp's app that's using this third party.
00:58:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then the third party goes. You don't have to log into your register.
00:58:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like, I get the access.
00:58:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How do you validate that somebody actually owns that domain?
00:58:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like, what is the verification process? Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I haven't, I just looked at to go play with it, play with the API, and then he'll come back and go, all right, this is how it's going to work.
00:59:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I will check because if they have that kind of permission, I mean, our is your domain safe. If anybody can get into it without.
00:59:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
If it might be that they do just log into our login and it passes it all through. That would make sense. That's probably how it works. So you're like not oh, I think, but it's sort of like that.
00:59:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Like plaid or something like that.
00:59:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's a good example. It's probably like that. They probably pull from a drop down. It's probably very much like plaid. And they just have every frickin provider. And then they can go in. Yeah, it's good. I was like, oh, that's interesting. But it would totally solve the problem.
00:59:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not paying attention to the time.
00:59:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
got to pay attention to the time. right.
00:59:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then that app.
00:59:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. And then I just reached out to the follower flow. guys for an update and haven't gotten an update. And the Spotify app no update waiting for that I think that's gonna take like two more weeks Until we get an answer if yes or no or nothing.
01:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what you said last week.
01:00:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, it's five weeks total So, okay, I think I still do the date. I say in the date. So five weeks or whatever the date I said you is most likely when we're gonna hear back.
01:00:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, I kind of recall that Yeah, um, oh what I was gonna ask Was next steps, but oh no, okay, so let me just say this because I do have to go but What you were talking about with chat DPT and its calculations And I know your brain already goes here, but the thing that I was thinking is how do you validate its formula and you would have to know what its formula is but if you understood its formula and you could validate it by Whatever it's playing data from and however it's making its calculations but basically replicate that formula, those calculations, that outcome so that you understood it and could verify that it works, then you've got a solid valuation process that you can be using for potentially purchasing other catalogs or helping people to sell their catalogs as a service or just another way for mom to generate revenue, but it just really stood out to me that having a formula like that would be really powerful.
01:01:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's what I said to it. I was like, I want to build a formula for this and then it added some stuff. go, well, I don't think Spotify has only been around, you know, Spotify has been around whenever I go, yeah, but how long is it number one? And it's like, oh, it's only the number one since the late 2010, like, oh, great. So now we're going to use that. So let's say, you can't say, you can't give me a calculation based on 2020. years is when I'd be around 20 years.
01:02:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like, you make a good point. We have to consider that they won't be the market leader. like, right?
01:02:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And it can't it literally created like a point system, like based on the age of the band, the age of the band's catalog, the number, whatever. So I need to get it to like integrate some other things. But then the math of Spotify or a stream is 100 percent correct, like 0.004, like it's some ridiculous number. So yeah. Now the question is, will the label go for our finance? don't see why they wouldn't. It's positive cash flow. Right.
01:02:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to pause the questions that are popping up my brain so I can keep to my schedule. But it just goes so fast. So many things to ask and then anyway. Have a good day. Take care of yourself.

I cannot tell you how many times I am just picking up my phone to text you and then you log it.
00:00:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's like the internet stop working. I'm like, I'm disconnect the Wi-Fi and now I'm getting bombarded with like, hacks and I think I'm show you what going to show you.
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was behind the camera, so I can't show you this, but I'm going to show you what I did and got home at midnight last night after having done. Hold on, cuz it was crazy, damn, where'd go, here, this, you have an iPhone so I can just send a bunch, use bunch of grandma's, well not everybody was a grandma, one was not a grandma, but I am. And now I have two grandchildren, let's see, this one and this. also that so that you can see we climbed a mountain yesterday at a top of a rock and there was legit rock climbing with no equipment and some of it was pure vertical and the only way I got up there was wedging myself between rocks and arm strength because I was too short to get the foot holds and hand holds that on that rock that mountain yes it was three and a half miles there and back and we watched the sunset on top of the mountain and we could see two volcano mountains from where we were that were a hundred miles away on one side and one hundred miles away on another side and then we climbed down in the dark with headlamp so I was in trumpet AF last night mmm that was a wild that was fun it was cool how to share Uh, hey, how did you talk to Lisa at all?
00:02:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I sort of did, but not really. No, she's like in Jackson Hole or something. So she kept dropping out. So she was like driving through Nevada or something to Wyoming. We're not what the hell she's doing. So I just gave up.
00:02:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's so much of that and that is just dead zone.
00:02:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so she was like, I lose you right here, losing him. I was like, and then it was like, no, here. No, no, no, wait, no. And then it actually got cut off and I was like, no worries. Oh, I don't know when she's coming back. think my mom told me, but I'm scared of me.
00:02:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, um, so where's my notes, notes, she. So let's start with basis. How's that going since last week?
00:03:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
with Frank yesterday and they kind of they be I'm a second visa or I'm a second visa and Eric like who all met exactly the second.
00:03:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay.
00:03:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
All of them. Okay.
00:03:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:03:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They're all but Norio.
00:03:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yeah.
00:03:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. they were they were just trying to like like the like imagine Frank is like the blocks expert, right? So he's unlike the cutting edge of all that, right? And WordPress will like change the name of something and Frank adopts it immediately. He's like, oh, it's called this now. So like some of the some of the names we're using are not what they are now. So when he hears, but the word still is around.
00:03:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It just has a new meaning.
00:03:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So what we call a pattern, for instance, this is true, but let's say it is, what we call a pattern is now called a layout, and a pattern is now something else. So they got together and they said, hey, we think there's some confusion around, like we need to make sure we're on the same page about what these things mean, or make sure that we're all using this to correct terms, right, because we think that we say this, and it turns out they were right. So it was like, okay, so they got the same page about that. And then they brought him up to speed on some of the other stuff that he was confused about, like, hey, why are you using a cloud? Why do you want to use a cloud library for this? how are you doing this? Eric's like, I think we got it, like, we definitely got it now. he's like, I think he was impressed even more. was like, oh, okay, got it. So then they said, for now, like, ranks, sort of like coming at it from a long term approach, like, Hey, you know, when you have a hundred clients, you're gonna want to be have this. And he focuses sort of in there. And they're like, we appreciate that. But we want to, we need to be working on the short term rather than the long term.
00:05:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we work on the short term.
00:05:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And for us, the short term is being able to do XYZ, whatever. he's like, got it. Okay, yeah, it's like, it's not that we don't want to do what you're talking about. It's like, we don't need that now, we need that then. But let's do the now, now and then then. And then Eric today was like, he was like, Hey, I just want to let you know, like, if it would be possible to keep him around for like once a month calls, like once we get this stuff out of the way is like to keep him around as an advisor for some sort, he's like, I think that would be super beneficial. I said, sure.
00:05:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thinking about having. Yeah, more long term anyway.
00:06:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no, okay, no, because I don't, I wouldn't assume that that was possible. So he never mentioned anything about like a monthly engagement or anything like that. All that he has said to me was, Hey, maybe maybe when we're done with this, you could help me sell my stuff. Or do you know how to do that? I'm how to do this. Maybe there's mean we can work either like that. And funnily enough, Eric was today, before I said this, Eric, Eric was like, man, if Frank used our stuff, he'd sell so much more of his course or whatever.
00:06:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's like his check out and all his stuff is terrible.
00:06:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But the code is good, right? So it's like, he's like, he's good at code, like really good. So that's the threat. So now they were like, this is what we want, we want to be able to do. These are the things, the problems that we have, let's resolve these problems. ones. So an example would be when we import a cloud template, make sure that it adopts all the styles, being able to set the global styles so that when you add a block or a gravity form or whatever, it adopts all of those. So that's what they're working on. And then showed him why it might not be the best solution for some of the that he's talking about, or we can do it like this. And he was like, oh, okay, yeah, that makes sense too. So yeah.
00:07:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, the goal is still to get wolf or done by October, okay. And the G4, the journey, how are we doing?
00:08:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think there's something wrong with one of our plugins. have to, I set up a test yesterday because I implemented our lead tracking on CMA. I'm for sure getting leads from ads and what I'm seeing, those events are not firing in, oh, you know what it is, the GTM container. I have to go to the container. It's not finally the container.
00:08:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
think I just figured it out. What is CMA?
00:08:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The certified management accounting exam.
00:08:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
00:08:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So we launched that site, whatever, like a year ago. It's. been steadily getting sales. So then I purposely tried to get leads. I'm getting like two or three leads a day right now. But they are not going up in Google Ads or Google Analytics. But I think I just can't a step. Do you know?
00:09:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, you cannot, Dan. You cannot skip a step.
00:09:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I followed the swap that I created. I would have realized I'd skip a step and I'd just get it on the fly. Did you follow the process? I did not. No wonder I didn't work.
00:09:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I did So what else in that journey, what else did you want? I don't know what else did you do related to G4.
00:10:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So Melissa is that she'll have all the stuff reviewed by the end of the day today. then she wanted to meet tomorrow. I'm not sure I can because I didn't think this stuff was tracking. But now I do think that stuff is tracking. So I need to go also saw something else weird yesterday that to go look at. Like there was an event firing in CMA that technically shouldn't be unless the way I defined it was URL based. And I said something like, hey, anytime a URL has SP in it, which would be a sales page, then do this. And if that's the case, then it would be correct. That is not the case that it's incorrect. And if that is the case, then I should have seen two other events and I didn't. So either the one event has messed up something's wrong, I think. So I have go look at that because the stuff that she's going to build is based off these three events firing on the sales page. But it would be that only a ninja because they just got a custom set up. It could and should be that they do fire on all sales pages across domains because they're not in any way product specific or page specific other than sales page is like this.
00:11:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The should only throw in a sales page.
00:11:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I'm going to go make sure that a they're actually all firing correctly on ninja CPA. And if they're not, then I can't be with her because they're needed to build the report. If they are, then I can be like, okay, yeah, let's jump on a call and do at least one. Let's just do that one. Just broken the fix.
00:11:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:11:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm still going to like the custom JavaScript version of his thing, which is custom JavaScript, which I do not do, but I'm going to learn how.
00:12:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. What does that allow you to do?
00:12:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think it's going to allow me to fire custom events based on custom documents, right? So the JavaScript says sort of like an if this, then that. If this happens, then fire writes out an example would be using that to fire my new customer event. So I'd say hey, if this is a new customer, then fire a new customer event. There's nothing built into GAPore or the GTN plugin or Woo that's made for that. So it's going to allow me to do this custom JavaScript.
00:13:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll be interested to see what those events are and so if you can't do it in GA4 or custom JavaScript, can you give me an example of the event?
00:13:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Because I think of that and think you can do it with custom JavaScript. It's not going to be a default event, so a default event in GA4 would be a form submit, they have a built-in event that I see firing that I didn't set up, so a custom event would be not default, it's not built-in at all, and then it's also you're defining it, right?
00:14:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, like for example, was it be scrolling to a certain page?
00:14:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Is it add the card? Is it add the card?
00:14:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no, yeah, all those are all those are built in.
00:14:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's fine. Yeah. So it's outside of those and then it can be completely custom, like new customer. No one is going to be, I mean, I'm not going to say no one, but probably very few people have ever set up a new customer event. So that's going to be me waiting for the order transaction result page to hit. And then I'm going to do a look up in the blue. I'm going to say, is this a new customer or not? If yes, then fire this custom JavaScript and call it new customer. Like event is new underscore customer.
00:14:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my god, what purpose like just to know that this transaction was from somebody that you've never had before or like to what end is what I'm getting at.
00:14:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, so then. in GA4 I can say, show me new customer sources. I say, your new customers come from Google organic.
00:15:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got you.
00:15:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Got you. Got you got you. Also, like, you know, then it would be like, you got this many new customers along the stuff that we already know, but it would be in that place too. And then, if I can do that look up and fire it into GA4, then I could also say, and go apply this tag in the infusion talk.
00:15:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We used to work around with that with Infusionsoft and onto port with what we call the sandwich page. That was sandwiched between checkout and the thank you page, the landing page that the customer got to once they purchased. in the checkout page settings, you can always say, okay, where do they go after completion of checkout? so it would go to a sandwich page and all that was on there. was a pixel, a tracking pixel, and a redirect, a meta redirect, so that it happened, you know, within seconds. And so the customer never saw it because it's a blank white page, and it just looked like a page was loading. But that fired the pixel, and then it would go to their landing page, and it happened so quick that, you know, nobody was upset or bothered by it, but then it allowed us to get a fire, a pixel fired that wasn't built into any of the systems.
00:16:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, similar principle, except just JavaScript faster. Yeah, well, and you can do more, right, so I can like delay, I could send the event in the data layer after the fact, I can send it with everything else.
00:16:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that appending data is amazing. And I only seen that though, what JavaScript and jQuery.
00:16:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right, same principle.
00:16:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's cool. love that. You're, this is a whole, I probably said it last week though, sharpening your saw and like, you can hire people for this stuff but not really well because people that do it as a job, do it as a job and their interest level is not optimized, it's not leverage, it's not simple, it's always bloated, it takes too long, it's not super refined, it's not as excellent as it can be whereas if you do it, even though it's working in your business, it's still working on your business because you're setting up the foundation for like, it's the vision, right? Basis is the the basis, that foundation tech stack that is, it's the tools but it's the systems and it's the processes and it's the methodology of using everything to it's fullest. It's potential, which is why Mercer will always have, you know, job security and you will end our business, however you want to look at it. But it's just such higher level than what almost everything else has done. It's the leverage. It's the data. It's clean data. It's fast data. It's attached data. It's data that tells the whole story from beginning to end so you can figure out what works, what doesn't work, how well it works, what works best, blah, Nobody else is going to do that like you would do it. So I'm glad you're doing it.
00:18:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. That's thing is like you can't, you can't measure what you don't know, right? It's like, I'm figuring out like, oh, yeah, want to measure. And then his custom JavaScript, so mine's like even more custom. And I can't, there's this, there's this idea that you can, you can take something like that and you can put it in as something else I can't remember the name of. But he's like, it's very rare that people use this, and I'm like, I have a feeling that's exactly what I'm going to need. And then his custom JavaScript is to do other things, like maybe you're combining events or you're defining your own where they scroll and stop plus 40 seconds. Like, I think you have to create a timer which JavaScript it does the 40 seconds. And they're like, okay, now fire it. So I'm getting into his stuff. But I think there's, and then I think once I go through his stuff, then, of course, that's going to make me go, Oh, I could do this, this and this too. Yeah, Lucy's, Lucy's working on the Lucy set up the creator user on form. It's working. We're making sure that doesn't break anything. He said, doesn't break anything. been live for like two days. Nothing's broken, but I know I haven't seen anything bad. And now I have to take the next step there is for me to get him to to insert custom meta on like I got to define the meta and then send it to them and say okay great create this meta so when they submit the form and you create the user also attach this meta magnet notes source whatever the source is in PGT I just have to look for and see like it'll probably like source not medium maybe campaign or keyword probably keyword oh and then Norio's gonna have to like I didn't know this but they've added utms so there's some new utms and then there's these new utms that have been added and then there's these other utms that are usable but not officially added that you know just allow you to and more data so Norio would have to like expand our plugin to include those, but we don't need them right now.
00:21:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, one tab, there we go. yeah, so how's Noriel's stuff with high level and fan flow going?
00:21:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, so he and I went around and around and there was some, so he has to sort of learn it, right, and then, but he gets to learn it, Ruby going, oh no, no, no. Go here, look at this, it does this, so he sort of gets short cut, only thing is to wait. Well, he doesn't really have to wait, right? By the time his email hits me his day is over and then when he wakes up the next day, he's got his answer provided I responded, and then lately he's been staying, he's screwed up later in the day, he was emailing me yesterday or he's working later because he was emailing me like definitely after her day was over but I think I got um everything he needs to get his first app working and then the the mod side or whatever the JD photos was named in their company the JD photos guy we we hooked up with them because they had the custom value updater that's how I found them so I paid 250 bucks to get access to their it's like lifetime access to their custom value updater but we keep running into it not working like intermittently and we don't really know it didn't work until somebody notices something's wrong kind of thing or something breaks essentially and then we'll trace it back and be like oh the values didn't get updated so those guys don't know when it breaks clearly we don't I don't know when it breaks, and then we hit them up and say, hey, this isn't working. So on the call of Monday, I'm like, man, this, when I was already thinking this, this doesn't work long-term. Long-term we need our own custom value updater, and we need one that would check, did the update occur? No, then run it again, or did the update, and if you can't, then it would send a message and say, custom values did not update something, something that would let someone know it's wrong. Ultimately, it would just not, it would just work or self-correct. So I hit up Norion, I was like, hey, I'm going to see if these guys will sell me their code. What do you need? And he's like, oh, you know, I need a walk-through or docs, and just that explains how it works, and he has seen some, he's seen the code that they write, and he's like, dude, their code's terrible. It's like it works, but it's not good. I'm like, not our concern at the moment, Norion. focus on the first part.
00:24:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was.
00:24:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So he like used some of their code to write his app. And so he's like, yeah, we can we can do that. I hit up those guys and told I explained to him, hey, look, listen, breaks. We don't know when it breaks. Ultimately, we need to own our own version, and I buy a copy of your code. And then we'll move it to our server and, you know, do that. Like, I was like, let me ask the developers. And then he came back, he's like, yeah, sure, we can sell a few 700 bucks.
00:24:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Done. What?
00:24:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So Stacy literally just sent them 700 bucks. And, uh, Nario just, I told Nario needs a loom. And, and then he's already worked with them to move code around. So they'll get it sent up on the server. And then Nario will tell me, I'll tell him what's wrong with it after the fact. We don't know when it doesn't work. So I'm sure he'll be like, that's easy.
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, typical, or real fashion. Um, okay. Hold on a second. Seriously, click over there. So like, what is the, I have to go back and look at my notes from last week. Hold on a second. Was all this week? No. Yeah. I don't have like, what are the targets for what Noreo is doing?
00:25:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Meaning.
00:25:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what do you, he's working on building fan flowy, right?
00:25:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But he's finishing the wedding, the, the wedding time. Yeah, but that's still, that's Abishik keeps finding like bugs and whatever. So there's, it's like true bugs and Noreo's fixing those and then there's nice to house or what if it. And the what if it did nice to haves are being Saved but not worked on so nor is just fixing the bugs and He got another round of those literally on Monday right right up to the meeting So he's like I'm not sure what I'm gonna be done. It's weeks, but he's like provide it He's like I thought Abhishek was done, but I literally just got an email with like five more So but he had talked to Abhishek about hey just yes, I want to hear it all and separate them like this And so they're doing that He's like man. He is good at finding this stuff and he really is So that will probably be done I would say by the end of September and Then Eric is talking to Norio about What to confirm is what we tell you about the summer day So we have the free wedding seating planner for epitome and then I bought the way of that So that's basically just a lead gen site and it's fill out this form and get access to our free win and seeding planner The idea being we generate leads they tell us engage pop up by Budget all the good stuff and then we give them access we limited access to Perfect wedding timeline just the seeding planner portion So Eric's needs to talk to Noria about okay, how do we do how are we doing that? It's gonna be a gravity form to what a webhook an API What and then once that function is worked out Greg's already done the design and then we'll just do like a super simple I mean problem. I mean I say a one-page site might legitimately mean it like there might be some Content pages that we do in the background that are for SEO, but like they're not in the nav Right, there's there's nothing for sale on that site It's just straight up you want to pre-winning seating planner popped in.
00:28:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I like that. And what is, do you have like a target date for that?
00:28:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I mean, we can't use it until the software is done. So we're going to try to, once we know the connection, then, I mean, I might look at like, it's like, what is a good, I'm sure there's one, I'm sure there's one from back in the day, where it's like just a pure lead gen site. Like to me, it's just like, that you're free-winning, like, and every email. And then of course, it'll just expose the other fields. So I might just look for like, what's the best opt-in site ever? Great, someone had like a free SDO analyzer, like back in the day, like crushed.
00:28:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Things just didn't.
00:29:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It'll be something like that. I'm going to go find something like them and just do that. Fine. I mean, that will take Craig. 20 minutes, and it'll take like, and I'm still at the thing where I'm like, I don't want to build sites until this stupid thing is done. So there's also that. I'm interested to see like how far they get. I think they meet with Frank every, I think it's every week.
00:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now they just back on top of vacation.
00:29:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:29:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Right. Oh, I have the notes about high level is raising third party integrations, but I just kind of left that hanging and I don't know. remember talking about it, but I don't remember.
00:30:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
scenario to review but it's not like unlocked yet you can't even what they do is they they release stuff in the lab so it's going to be in the lab I want to say like yeah I want to say it's like three weeks but there was some doc there was some documentation on it when I sent you to Norio okay and on Monday he's like all review it and like you know like sort of was like this is what I'm thinking like that it's going to be like another level of being able to integrate with it and I mean that's exactly what it sounded like so it's like beyond APIs I'm like I don't know what that really means that'd be interesting yeah I think it's that you can get access to like user ID and stuff that you can't get access to be just the API so we'll see um let's hold on a second
00:31:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, so the conversation about basically having the kind of menu items and what the team can provide when people request custom work or, you know, like what's the scope of support basically for basis customers, Bobbi was getting back at that and making sure that everybody's on the same page with that.
00:31:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Where is that at right now? I don't know. Did I not go to meeting on Monday? I missed it.
00:31:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was like, it had to be over within nine minutes because I went there. was like, holy crap, I snoozed the alarm one too many times because I was making lunch. I was like, oh, it's like night after. And then I dial in and there's nothing.
00:31:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We definitely didn't talk about it.
00:31:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Need to talk about it?
00:32:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We didn't talk about it. mean, I know he was working on, but I don't know. don't know that I'll see if it should be a task somewhere. I don't ever go into work.
00:32:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to knows of. If she doesn't know of it, then it's probably not passed out, but we'll see. Just to make sure that it's getting traction. Oh, Brunchy, no more issues, only reset you with the last thing.
00:33:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So we figured out the fact that if user logged in and creates an API, it's only visible to that user. It's not visible to anybody that has admin access to the account. So Heather had logged in and created an API key at one point. Ross had logged into their account, Ross had landed, logged in and created an API key at one point. I wish I could be J had logged into range. And then they were something, whatever, one of the sites and they'd created an API key. So then when Eric or whoever was going in and changing the API key and I'm replacing it on the site, there was always another API key that that person couldn't see. One way or the other. So there was Eric, he didn't see Abishik. He didn't see Abishik, he didn't see Eric, so it was Heather. She didn't see Eric, so there was Eric, he didn't see Heathers. So in essence, it was always an API key available. So when the one, you know, Heather and Ross and those guys, they're not working on the site. So what was happening was Eric would change the API key and whooper and it would still happen. We're like, how is this happening? We never understood how it was happening. It was because there was an exposed API, there was a compromised API key that was there that nobody essentially knew about. So now they've all been deleted. And then Only we are creating API keys and those like do not create API key and it's definitely quelled it almost completely but Wolfers We're trying to get them moved over to stripe and then brain tree still giving us a bunch of Like we're like we're not even using you guys anymore and they won't the account Because they're like your account is still at risk. We're not using it So it's not at risk and they're like you need to put capture on your checkout will unlock the account That was this morning like oh my god really So soon as that one gets out of risk they'll unlock the account and then proceed with the migration step but they have not done that yet and I think with Think with Reset you there were so few that they just manually migrated them or they're going into, but in the brain news off. So the other two are underway. They will hopefully be off within a week or less. And then we're done with brain tree.
00:36:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was the most outcome. how is another 71 doing just any updates since last week?
00:36:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Actually the week part is the same at the weird part is. It's the same average of last year where last year we thought we're going to increase sales because they're changing the exam, right? Which now seems like maybe wasn't totally true. Maybe it was just, I mean, again, we don't have enough data, right? Because if you go back three years, you're in this COVID world. So we're like point, like point one off. So like, let's say last year we were averaging 30, 33 point or 34 sales a day or something. Right now, we're like 33.9, oh my God, so it's like nearly identical. And then that persisted through, well, that went well into December with this gigantic spike right before the exam was removed. So we don't know. We don't know what's gonna happen. We're just keeping on, keeping on. It's still just going to come down to where the new customers come from, especially where the new customers come from in 2025, or at least from May of this year forward where things sort of return to normal, but then more so in like, okay, this is normal. We're in a normal year. Where do these people come from? It's still going to come down to that. Even if we're just back on track or back, we're at this pace of like the best pace ever. I think we're up to like almost 4300 subscribers. It's still going to be like in order to grow this.
00:38:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We have to know where your customers come from. Right.
00:38:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
that's... We bought CMA exams.com, like a week, a week ago, two weeks ago. So I just was texting Bobby about that, so we're building that site. So now we'll have CPA exam.com, CMA exam.com, there isn't an equivalent for CPE, but we started getting some CPE sales, our renads for those, we started getting sales, but I'm not sure they're coming from there yet, but that'll be the thing, it's like, okay, once I can get all this tracking lined up and locked in, then we're gonna know. Oh, and the other, and then we figured out, I never thought about this before, so we started ranking for ethics exam, so the ethics exam is this exam that they have to take after they've passed all four sections, so it's like literally your final step before you get licensed, so we had ethics exam pages on CPA exam.com and then I noticed, I think it's like an off-sh of the other SEO that maybe those started ranking better, and then we've gotten an uptick in leads there, and then I was like, wait a minute, we could rank for all 50 states for those, and essentially you're gonna get a bunch of people that pass the exam with who knows who, I don't care. I don't care what you bought at this point, but I do know that you're gonna need CPE in the near future once you get your license, so that we have an ethics exam guide for all the states. So like, if we start SEOing that, then start pitching those people into CPE, that could probably work out. So Gert and those guys, we gave them, we bought like 25 SEO pages of them. We're like, hey, can we take four of those and do these four ethics exam pages, we just picked the top. Like, I know, I think we've picked Delaware for some reason. Oh, because it was the most representative what the content should look like. So we actually took one page, sent it to them. They're going to optimize that one. And then we're going to say, great, not going to these four based on the template you just came up with. So then they'll do California, Florida, Texas, New York.
00:41:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's I mean, that just seems kind of like this similar type of stuff that we've been doing with Mark, which is leveraging more, don't know, sources, not necessary sources, but entry points. Yep, it is too. Yeah, the market increase and that those analytics like that systematic, detailed, accurate level, analytic stuff that you're working on and building is who else is doing that? else is doing that. Like I feel like you're going to exceed your goals quickly. I don't know what quickly is. can't quantify that, but I think that the pace will be like when you get there be like, damn, I don't like, look what happened.
00:42:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and it's all like, you know, whether you sell it or not, you, you know, just make more money.
00:42:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. You were talking about getting back to your breathing stuff.
00:42:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Did you do that? Yeah, I did. I did something else, but I did it on Mondays. What'd you do? Yeah. got it. It was this other sort of guided thing because I was at home. So I like, I can't really. was at home and I had the dogs when I can't really check out for an hour. So I was like, I could probably check out here in the hammock for 20 minutes. Mm-hmm, and it worked whatever was I forgot about it was one I'd never done But I was like, oh it was it was one that was like It's like a meditation to get in touch with your spiritual guide. I was like, I'll try that I found an audible weirdly enough Interesting I want to my thought about me either I've got like a gazillion audible credits lined up.
00:43:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then I proceeded to buy like five books Okay Snaps, Snaps I I'm scrolling back to obvious eight and it says that your peak in the past was 4,000 60 active subscribers and did you just tell me today?
00:44:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
at your 4300? Oh, no, the 4,060 is the proverbial glass ceiling.
00:44:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that year passed?
00:44:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, yeah, but I realized you can pass it, right, during your peak season. So my guess is, let's say, so yeah, we're passing. So let's say we, I think we hit that early July mid mid-July. I think we hit a mid-July. So from that day forward, my guess is if I take that number and the number on January 1st, the average will be 4060. It can't really be more than that because the math dictates. But can you exceed it right now? but then I also know in December, we will get three or four hundred cancellations. So let's say we get up to 44. for 100, which we may or may not, but whatever it is, we know there's going to be a mass exodus in December. And then if you were to average it out, your average is probably going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 4060. And Bobbi's like, we're past it. And I was like, yeah, that's true. But there's some missing something. And then I thought, oh, wait, yeah, of course you can exceed it.
00:45:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But averages are basically not that. Well, that's going to be fun to see and interesting. It'll be funny, even if it's true, because the numbers, well, yeah.
00:45:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So the only thing that will change it is if the 33 remain, right? That's based on it being 31 average as well, right? So if the average is stays at 33, which we won't know until November, then you can exceed the 4060. Then it would be whatever I'd have to rerun the math and be like, okay, now it's 40 109 or whatever that
00:46:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is 33 being new, um, customers, right a day, uh, subscriptions, new subscription, not new customers, customer, the customers is a 21 or whatever we've always been using 21 and 31.
00:46:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Those, those are the ones that got us.
00:46:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I really want to, like, make this stand out so I can find this, that's easy because what I really would like to have for each of these projects, because my notes are weekly, right, and I go review and sometimes I copy and paste notes from the week before into next week's coming out or like save this for next week and just copy it so that I know I want to talk about But what would be really good is if while I'm talking, I've got the stats of whatever it is that we're working on because I have to keep a lot of that in my head or be able to scan through the notes quickly find it. Teamwork as a system for kind of tracking progress by itself isn't that great. probably just need to have like my own kind of stats spreadsheet. So I have this, so I'm not like asking that constantly and it's always staying in my head. It stays in your head because you're doing it all the time. But I ask better questions if it's in my head all the time also. And when I'm thinking about it throughout the week, I'm always thinking about these things throughout the week, then it's more effective too. So anyway, not to self, actually, I'm going to send that email to myself. And apparently the problem with email is not on the Y. That's weird. Oh, just because you have so many things going on, you're the only person that has so many things going on, but I have so many things going on and you have so many things going on. So that's a lot of my brain, which is low to my brain, and the nodes do help a lot, but I think that they could be better if I had those particular things, which are especially because the goal of being creating the market share increase, the value that we want to get to, like those are all the bullets that I want to have is like where we're at, when's the last time we measured and what are the things that are doing and just kind of, and I don't think you look at it quite the same way I'm talking about doing it. I think that it'd probably be helpful to you too, just to go like, oh yeah, it's actually this. And then what I know about your brain is when you see something more often than you would have put it in your face because you do have all the things going on. Your brain just goes light up and thinks of something else and then you go do something else. Incredible. And then come back like, what happens when I do this? So anyway, I will set that up. What is this? Oh, that was the new product for another 71 that you were talking about. You've launched that, right?
00:49:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No. met Melody was getting some pushback from Melody and she wanted to build it a certain way. I'm like, no, no, no. And then she's like, we need to talk about this. I attended the call and she explained it. And then when she was done talking, she was all like, this is it. I just said, wrong. It's like, that's to be rude. Wrong. He's like, no, no, no, no, no. Like, we don't like this. And then I explained it to her and her and the other guy were like, yeah, we could do it that way. And then we all get what we want. Your way, I lose a lot. You gain a lot. And I lose a lot. This way we both don't lose. You gain what you want to gain. I gain what I want to gain. And it's all better off. So then they're like, then now they're going about building that, which is essentially it involved like re-architecting the tags. It's like a slight re-architecture. But but because it's across like six products and yadda yadda. and we had to remove a bunch of tags, they're like, all right, we're gonna go build it out and then, I'm right, I mean, I know I'm right, because I thought about it, I'm like, I'm right, this will work, and it will resolve a bunch of issues, so they're in the process of doing that re-architecture and creating the missing tags, and then writing down, okay, we're gonna get rid of these tags, and this is how we're gonna get rid of them, and then they hooked up, they hooked up a plugin yesterday that helps them, they're very concerned about like, people losing access when they have two subscriptions, which really isn't that big a deal, but even that will be resolved, and then part of the plan would also be to eliminate the infused Woo plugin, which their convinced is somehow causing some of these issues, which may or may not be true, and I was Like, that's fine, because I took portions of that away from that. I took portions of the functionality away and put it in Zapier, and it's worked fine, but we could use make, like, either or, um, so the plan is for them to get it all mapped out, built, essentially, and then, then we're going to figure out when we can launch it. And we're basically at, like, the price is going to be, like, 77 and 87, think. Jeff didn't want to do the 77. I'm like, we have to, because if nothing happens, we've done this for nothing.
00:52:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Remind me with the 77 and 87 are.
00:52:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
do have that, but I didn't do it good that 77 a supplement 87 is full course, right? Okay. And we just had someone, this was online. like last week someone went on a Reddit and they started this thread and it was like do not buy me just cpa review it to rip off and it the guy was complaining that he was complaining about he was complaining that that didn't refund them or something it was like super super ready and then like a mild pile on started with this other guy that came in and then all these other people started commenting and it was just it's just so sad that it's so clear they think it's a supplement they think it's a supplement and then they also questioned the sixty seven dollars i'm like oh my god and then our people showed up the ninjas showed up and they're like what are you talking about like do the math If you buy a Becker for 3,000 if you buy a ninja and you take each second up to the three months at a time time 67 you're only spent you're spending less than a thousand dollars, and then they're like just the best I've never had a problem with him. He's the only person he's been in this industry forever He's the only person that comes right just the deluge of defenders and then I guess the mods came in They weren't around and they're like yeah, we're deleting this whole thing This is this person just joined reddit and their first thing is to to track and slag on one of the best cpa review courses There is delete they deleted the whole thing.
00:54:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you get the screens?
00:54:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's first no like I Was like it I was like on my phone To get well we have tons of those there's tons of those on on reddit So I do want to start using them on the new sales page because I think they're more powerful than yes You know testimonial block We have great ones. We have whole threads that just wave about us.
00:55:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, but you for sure should be using them in your marketing.
00:55:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I don't. We have one that's literally called is Ninjacy. And this is like someone asking a question for real. Is Ninjacy Pay Review a scam? Like I couldn't have paid to have someone do that. We use it in our emails. In case you're wondering if Ninjacy Pay reviews a scam, go here. And it's all these people raving about it. We have this one dude on Reddit that's like are one of our biggest defenders. He's like, I passed all four sections using Ninja whenever, but his screen name is Nutella Nick. Oh, I know. I'm like, oh, buddy, it's hard to recognize you in marketing. Only because it's a trademark term, not no other reason.
00:55:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:55:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah. But he showed up. He showed up and like went off like, this is .
00:56:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, but couldn't you use it and then just like black out parts of the username like and you.
00:56:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, no, we don't even need to use this. No, there's tons of them. But I want to use those instead of the, I mean, we created these testimonial blocks. But I'm like, and we have like the Reddit logo. I'm man, we should be using just straight screen caps of those. And then, and then them in those locations, rather than us cutting pasting the actual thing and linking to it. Like we'll cut and paste and then link to the actual thing. But no one's probably clicking through. mean, that's something I can look at. But I doubt people are clicking through. Whereas they, if they see it's from Reddit, just from the, like literally like a better and then videos. It's like, okay, those are probably your two. best but i can split test this video testimonials yeah we use those those totally work i was just about to ask you about them because i think that like we have tons do you have a social media account or you just share that stuff regularly uh we i run them as ads on facebook this one this girl made is so good oh like oh my god you couldn't it's like it's like she made it on purpose but he didn't right and she sent it to us and we turned into an ad where do you stockpile your testimonials the video ones are in this service called boast and then the text ones we don't even gather anymore we just have so many it's ridiculous yeah but you should keep them current uh i mean they're not I don't think the date. I don't think we put dates on the testimonials. Um, any of them, really.
00:58:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think I don't even think we gather.
00:58:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, we gather them on the cancel. So they do, they do updates. I just haven't used a new one recently. Sometimes I'll you, I'll check out the video ones and maybe I'll swap in the video one here and there. Uh, but I try to let, you know, I'm trying to get someone that's like, they use Becker. They, they're a ninja only, right? I can only use like so many. Like I was with Becker and then this, right? So it's like, okay. and then I ran some of his ads and like you see which ones did good as ads, then I put them on the landing page and then I ran a test on the landing page at which one do people watch the most and I made that one first. Did you like that?
00:58:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I wish that we got to do another 71 completely separately because I I would so love to drive growth there, that would pay, would love to drop growth there too, hopefully I'll be able to do that as soon as the stupid tracking is worked out because I don't know how to drive growth there. I have so many ideas and there's stuff that you touch but not systematically. But once you get that set up, we'd be able to track everything. But it needs to be set up because I literally just been throwing stuff at the wall for years.
00:59:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm still convinced I could turn off all the ads and nothing would happen. Or it would happen but it would take six months. I'm like, I don't want to find out that way.
00:59:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Gosh, it's crazy just thinking about, first of all, it was seven years ago, and then you're like, I don't do email. I'm like, it doesn't work. I know, I know, look at that. And then maybe you might still be right. But regardless, the thing is, we've watched, we've learned it together with Mark is that there is a, you know, having multiple, so for him, it's vendors. For you, I think it would be channels, ad channels. Oh, yeah, like a formal approach and multiple tactics to what you're applying on those channels that don't in and of themselves make huge differences. But the compounding effect are like, first of all, anytime things dip, you don't really dip, you don't even feel it because everything else just kind of buoyed it up. But yeah, but the analytics portion of it is to be able to have very clear, reliable data is huge. And just
01:01:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
all the things that you've learned over the years anyway adding adding into that anyway that's awesome holy crap how's it 105 i could just whatever toy flies okay wait so meditations we're good you're taking care of you sound good found the good you've only just got her moving date so we gotta go visit the campus and then she moves in on his two day 2021 20 is a Friday i'm like probably moving in on the 21st that's a temper yeah she got her dorm assignment she's gonna have two roommates and a expert large triple and everything i mean it's the oh she told me the name of the building it's like an author's last name no i think it's a hog So I think can tag another, I don't think that is another, so the HAG haul, I guess, and I don't know what the hell is up with college right now, but you want to talk about a light schedule. I was like, you're kidding. That's it.
01:02:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
01:02:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
was like four classes, period. What? That's it. That's it. And they're on the quarter system. So it's 10 weeks. And we have four classes, 10 weeks, and then 10 weeks. I don't know if some of them carry over, they're two quarter classes or whatever, but she's like maxed out on credits, which is like, I literally can't take anymore. She's like one credit guy, I'm like the total max, and that's four classes or something. And then her earliest classes at eight and her latest classes at eight p.m.
01:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
01:02:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But also also.
01:02:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's a wide.
01:03:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
breath yeah so what's she taking on that like what's her major bio no biology microbiology okay how far away is she doing the school yeah it's eight hours drive uh it's an hour of life hour now how is Denise doing i'm waking up in the middle of the night thinking able and leaving really yes yeah you don't need the care i'm like for though i just look at it as part of life i mean it's what happens unfortunately things move forward where we march on it's going to be interesting how mario handles not having a sister around even if they don't get along you what she's already acting weird yeah it's it's hard i don't know if it's related, but it's like, I think it might be.
01:04:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, they're they're talking, they've been talking more than ever the last like two months.
01:04:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, like amongst themselves or whatever. And she's definitely over the I hate Evelyn face. I wasn't that long, but it would be had for a while. Yeah. then, yeah, so it'll be interesting see how her and Denise react.
01:04:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and you revolve car, you need the ocean, and you need to figure out how to keep those two happy, because this is going to be very hard for them.
01:04:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right, I, whereas I was like, you know, she apparently, so Jenny DeRoz went to the school to UC Santa Cruz. And I don't know what I said to her, but she's like, Oh, yeah, no, like, you're only guaranteed housing your first semester. And then the second semester, it's like hit or miss, or your first year, you have to live on campus for year, you can't have a car. And then your second year, you can apply to live on campus. But it like hit her mess. She's like, it's like, she said when she was gone, there was like a borderline crisis to get housing. And then everyone's like, no, it's still like that. Like everyone's saying like getting housing the second year. So then you have to get off campus. And Jenny's like, when we went to go off campus, she's like, I literally, you need a dossier on yourself to get the gut housing. And then we go apply for it. 50 people are applying. And then it's like hit her mess. And of course, my takeaway is like, oh, I should buy two bedroom condo and Santa Cruz, little mirroring.
01:05:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that play.
01:05:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I was like, that's the entrepreneurial take is property. Right. I'm gonna, if I'm gonna pay rent or, or boarding to the school, why wouldn't I just pay to myself? Right.
01:05:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm paying it either way.
01:05:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. like, I should go to, so a two bedroom condo. 800 grand, so I'm like, hmm, let's see how this election pans. I got about a year. like, can hit the fan between it's gonna hit the fan soon. What? they just revive, you see that the labor, the jobs, number revision that they just did, they're like, oops, turns out we were over by 800,000. You're kidding. Really? So that, until that, so that was like two, three days ago, leading up to that, and still even yesterday, people were talking about, oh, bed's gonna lower the rates. Well, part of the way they do that is they're using employment or rather unemployment as like a leading indicator. So it's like, they're like, unemployment's good, so you can lower the rates, is sort of already. And it's like, hmm, but if that number It was run by 800,000. Isn't this other number wrong? Like, isn't this leading indicator fake balls incorrect? Well, it's like, yes, but if they so they lower the rates, I mean, it sort of where this if you I was someone would show these charts, like the parallel between what's happening right now and like the two right before the 2008 crash is like very similar. A lot of the indicators look the same. So it's like, why wouldn't it go that way? And then lowering the rate. People are like, you know, a lot of financial people are like, you can't lower these rates. Like, you can't do that. You could trigger a much worse outcome. Ron doesn't say the whole time. There's no way this ranks. She's like, there's no way. There's no way that they keep saying soft landing. She's like, I don't see it. I don't see how it's possible. You have to pull a rabbit out of a hat. She's like, I don't believe it. I don't believe this is real and I would come in due time, like it's either it's going to happen, and then that would be like this quarter, right? They do. They only meet once a quarter. That meeting's probably in the next couple weeks. So they're either going to do it or they're not. And then the markets will react based on that. And we'll see. And then God only knows what happens with this election.
01:08:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't want this. I don't want either one of them. But here's the thing about Trump is like, we know who he represents him. He represents who he is, what he is. We know his pattern. We know his MO because he's a steady douchebag. But like what his strengths are, we have some definitely definite economical power, There's there's some good.
01:08:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He's disgusting.
01:08:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's right. Kamala is a puppet. Like she we don't I don't even know who she represents. I don't know what she represents. Somebody's behind her, now no idea who it is. I don't know what their MO is. I don't know anything about that. so she is a wild card that puts us at huge risk. And we have no idea. But why I think she'll win, which I don't want, but why I think she'll win, is because I think she will bring out the female and black voters just because she's woman and black, and that between the two of them, that's a population that has been largely just like, if everybody, I don't really care. I think a lot of females that never voted well now. And same with black people. And I think, and especially looking at the stats right now, how amazing she's doing, which is, again, terrifying. She's stupid. She doesn't know what she's doing. She doesn't stand for anything. And I don't know who's behind her. That's the most, yeah. So like in terms of like business and needing to create as much. Like I want to get to being able to rent my house out, buy another one, like have some property investments as soon as possible. There's no solid guaranteed investment, but the one thing about like in my church, we do food stores. I'm like, I'm gonna have property stores. If I meet family to live, you know, it can either make me money or it can house my people, but one way or the other, like that's where I want to start with it. Like yeah, kids. So okay, let me get back to your Denise Rowland for a second and the girls eight hours away, holy crap, you should buy the property. She is gonna hit the fan. I'm so glad that you're doing the work of the analytics right now because that foundation, like as she hits the fan, there are, and this is why I teach what I teach, it's fundamentals, right? There are certain types of things, clean, accurate data so that you Because a lot of people are going to be trying to guess and figure out what to do, and you're going to have the ability to know what to do, plus all the things that you've already built, the systems, the teams, the reputation, having had a very smart offer for a while now, especially with it being the subscription model that you already paid the price for, all the dip and finances. There's so many things that you've been doing, and we knew that the recession was coming. It took longer than most people, most of the analysts, most of the VCs thought it was going to take because they pumped money in, but we knew it was going to happen. And it gave you enough time to do such a good work, but I don't like, I mean, you might feel a dip, but it's not going to hurt you at all.
01:11:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Why don't you think that will be a dip because in 2008, I went and looked at this at one point. randomly because of David in 2008 when that uncertainty enters right it's not going to help it helps his business because people are like I need to get a new job right I need to they also retreat to education so they go my domain and yours so they retreat to education and there was like a we got a bump a noticeable bump back then and we didn't have our own product so it was like oh that's interesting and you could see I look up here I think I looked at search day I looked at a bunch of stuff I was like oh that's interesting plus we the if a pandemic didn't take us out pretty sure research is not like it was like they shut
01:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
down the entire business and it was like and we made it yeah that's it's crazy but it's awesome also if i can just get through whatever the it's just the having taken care of everybody so long getting myself so far in debt trying to do that when i get this going and all the data that i have with it like i don't worry about anything also because of the investing that i'll do but like there's so many there's so much volatility for so many people which is why i'm helping three other families but it's it's scary for other people and then i'm going to see so many people i care about just struggling because they're already struggling because things are so expensive but it's also amazing to me what being strategic and consistent can do for people yeah yeah anyway all right well good job I'm so glad you're doing the GA4 stuff. I cannot state that enough. It is so important.
01:14:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Anyway, good job.
01:14:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Really make some good plans for Mario and Denise and Evelyn too, although she's probably going to be having fun, but then she's also going to get very homesick and that you're going to be in the middle of all of that. Good luck.
01:14:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I do think it's great. Here's the silver lining. If you time it rightly, that's a word.
01:14:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
01:14:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It actually is a word. That's the right way. You can like a flight to San Jose is like 60 bucks. So I was looking at that in my company. That's what we doable. So you could go visit her at the drop of a hat and it's not going to, right? Like 45 minute drive. Easy peasy. Like you could do that in the day anytime. Anytime you wanted, um, which was not the case for my parents playing from Boston to DC there in the sixty nine dollars life Made major of airports. You could just show Denise all the things that are on the table because she still doesn't really get like what you're Doing this. Yeah, we're gonna go. We're gonna go visit now because now we can go visit I was hoping it would play out like this. I go. Okay, great. I can buy a flight for like next Wednesday We fly up in there in the morning running a car driving the campus ago. This is your dorm This is where your first class is.
01:15:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is this.
01:15:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
This is that We're looking at like theirs target. Okay, great because we're gonna be here in two weeks doing this. Yeah, we're three weeks doing this again.
01:15:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, good. They're gonna do good, but keep using that brain of yours for Building your family because this transition period sucks. It's hard But it's better when you're when you when you do the planning and when you do all this stuff. they're just going to need you. That's all I'm telling you. They're going to need your even killed and an entrepreneur. We solve these things.
01:16:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, that bothers you. Let's fix that. Goodness. No parking. We're at the office. He's like, something's here.
01:16:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You took her to the office.
01:16:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Someone was supposed to be here. I mean, Eric and Stacy, and then I was like, can't be at home. Someone else was supposed to come out of office, who I think just, if it's them, I'm going to be surprised that you knew it was somebody else. Because Eric and Stacy, walking around the whole time, you haven't made a sound. I guess this is the other person's here.
01:16:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who do you have, Zinni or Bell? Bells. All right, so I will let you go figure out who that is and I will talk to you Monday.

Well, I'm talking back to you realize mine was muted, and I know I unclicked it, but then I was in the wrong meeting, and so I forgot the second time.
00:00:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Can you hear me now? Dan? I hear you, I hear you. Hey, about now? Oh, I think I can do this. I hear you. Does that make it better or worse?
00:00:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you hear me?
00:00:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
nothing.
00:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is it doing nothing? I hear you.
00:00:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
hear you. wait. No, I can't do that. Well, that is a good work. Do... this.
00:01:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you hear me now?
00:01:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I totally just I was like, I'm just gonna turn up Bluetooth. I hit the right one. I meant to hit because I think when I'm in the office it bites between data and Wi-Fi.
00:01:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah, I hate what that happens.
00:01:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then but I think that ruins the connection somehow. Same thing when you're outside when I'm outside my house and it's connecting to both, I'm like, I think I killed a Wi-Fi.
00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I just and I and in my driveway I have to do that every single time. The back of my house is really good but that's because the router is much closer to it.
00:01:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. I'm just like, I will turn you up and the struggle will stop now. Mark hired me to work with China. What?
00:01:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Mark hired me.
00:01:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Left field? Yes. Well, it's probably kind of because his way of helping me, but getting something out of it too. So, but she, the business that she's working in is she's not there just as an employee. It's she gets a percentage of it. So, I mean, without crossing boundaries too much and talking about it. So, that, yeah, that. So, I'll start that next week.
00:02:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Nice. And this, what do you, what, she's working at this new job?
00:02:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I don't, I don't. Yeah. So, um, he, she's like, I don't know what he's like, you need a business coach because she basically has enough autonomy in what she's doing and has income potential besides just doing the job, right? So, their strategy involved and his introduction. in between the two of us is Tina will help you reach your goals even when you didn't know you had. That's very nice. And then listening to her, she just was stressed out, like I don't know anything and I'm like well let me break it down for you like this. I'll ask you all the questions and figure out how to make things less stressful and it will be all about you because she was like Mark has all these ideas and big and he's just go go go go and sometimes he comes down but mostly he's just got these big things and she's like I just... again just yeah but that's that's a for it's it's a first but also it was interesting because the new guy that he referred me to he's like my wife needs you i'm like i don't know that just makes me feel happy it's different it's very different i'm pretty sure it's very different not a normal stuff right totally but i've never been normal so there's that and i work with not normal so hey not normal right exactly um i yeah i'm really interested now i want to ask about um the what you call it the the plane like deal that he got going oh i don't really know the deep other than it's done i mean like the tax thing like i'm just fascinated with oh that was that was yeah yeah that was like this thing very deep deep into the trump that thing i vaguely recall
00:05:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Something about it, but you know obviously that's for a very and I remember you know people complaining about it's rich people So yeah, he leveraged that and It's a thing I know obviously it's only a thing probably for I think being out expired is pretty soon I was gonna say But once you're in you're in And then so who bought a jet Just because it almost sounded like doing it with somebody else This this is the part I don't remember and then Selco explained it to me. He's like no dude. He bought the jet and then places the jet with the company that rents the jet out Something like that, and then And then you You it's like it's sort of like the weird Those you're gonna live in if you're gonna do this if you're gonna live in Puerto Rico You have to be there six months of the year The rule for this thing is like you have to use the jail X amount of times per year Every year for the first five years for something like that And but the numbers very long. It's like you have to use it five times That's interesting and then it cat it cash flows positive cash flows 12 grand a month to mark How I mean nobody can be mad about that nope That's crazy. Well, he's playing all these big boy games now like dang dude, right?
00:06:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's Wow, Marcus just
00:07:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Conan leaps and bounds in all kinds of ways.
00:07:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's pretty amazing. Also, very much a reminder to not judge books by their E.R. covers. Uh, so, I mean, between that and like him hiring me for Chona, and then giving me Fuji, and then letting me work with his clients, like he is far and wide, just been amazing. And he's here because of you. So, I'm thinking I need to send another little gift basket, but I think that it should be something Denise gets part of, because she's the other D and D and D co. And she's losing her babies and making her happy makes you happy. So, what kind of thing could I do for Denise? Like what, like chocolate or bath bombs or something? Can I send a thank you gift to both of you?
00:08:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. I'll let you know.
00:08:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. You're so quiet.
00:08:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Again, Ariel. Really?
00:08:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:08:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
up the volume.
00:08:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I think part of it is your dynamic too, though, because like when you are part of it, part of it.
00:08:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, okay.
00:08:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. So you'll give me some ideas sometimes. Cool. Because especially with able and going, like, yeah. I've been thinking about this for a few months, actually. And I asked Daisy too. And she's like, yeah, she, I know she likes chocolate. So, but I'm like, I need to know more cause. Yeah. Um, all right. Let me go by too much. But I love my notes. Oh, so there is something. I'm not really sure what it looks like and how to create it, but I think I might have talked about it last week, but I'm zeroing in on a different type of dashboard that I want to create, which is kind of like a client profile. Um, talking about something for Mark. Um, yeah, for everybody out. Well, I, for me.
00:09:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm not not clarifying this, but that way. No, no, no, no, no. Okay.
00:09:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
measure all the things that are important and so like original goals that people have if I'm starting with them, so I can just kind of watch how they improve and track. And some of them will be financial, but some of them will just be, you know, how many hours in the office, although Mark spending a lot more than there. feel like that's actually. I mean, now, but he. wasn't and he wants to be able to not go into the office for a month or two if that's what he wants. And so anyway, but whatever people's goals are and just kind of tracking like the team goals, the revenue on top of it, but I don't so like I have all my notes for everybody, but I don't have it like I'd have to go through and remind myself what was what and I would like especially because I work with people for years to go okay this is what it was and you know the year we started and this was the next year and the next year and just kind of look at each of those things that we kind of touch on over time and just see how it's evolved but also how they've evolved because sometimes the the values change um like marks goals have gotten a little they've changed a little but they're more clear so like before it was I want to play because I want to play And then he added more things onto it and part of it became his dad wanted him to do this deal and It's kind of a thing between them like he would have taken his dad on it and But anyway, so we're just thinking about that, but I think that that would be a helpful thing and It has a multiple applications So like if we created something and I have no version to show you But there could be something like this for like mom for your artists and for any product Products you work with like okay in a very simple thing. It just be a spreadsheet There's no software needed for it because it's basically verbal extraction where we get this information in the first place in Terms of like where they're at and how they see themselves, but also the actual measurable data so we can report real data also And then you know where they are like so what was their fan base when they started with you and and what was their schedule like when they started with you? How often were they putting out songs? You know what I mean? Like all these different types of things that matter because so let's say a person is like this isn't working, well tell me how it's not working. So we really only have certain types of metrics like followers and like revenue, right? But there are other metrics that affect the metrics. So how often are you meeting with your band? How often are you writing and composing new songs? How often are you putting out new songs? How often are all these different types of things, right? And then they'll also see the correlation. So let's say you onboard somebody and you ask them these things. What's your schedule look like? What are you doing? know, what's your output, that type of stuff? And then as they are spending six months or a year with you and you're giving them systems, but part of the system is we're telling you you need to do the stuff consistently and so they just change their behavior. That behavioral change is a real value. It's not something that like you can see a direct relation and revenue but it may not happen right away but it's a real value and you can see the different things that happen as a result of it. Anyway, that's something I've been thinking about. What do you think? Any thoughts?
00:13:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So yes, I get it. I think that for you, well for anyone but for you, like yes it would be a totally different set of metrics for a band and for like a teeny client. But yeah, it totally makes sense. But so for you, it would be, I would think, that there's what you're trying to deliver to them through the coaching, right? is, you know, there's like whatever. Time for freedom up above whatever it is, whatever your metrics are, right? There's that's sort of the promise of working with Tina and getting on that whatever that name I said the other day, I love that name, the freedom, something formula, I was like, that's a good name.
00:14:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm back, I'm right that down.
00:14:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's in the notes or it's in whatever I said to John, don't even know how I said to do, but so there's that and then there'd be like the play and I think is a bad example, right? It's like they need to be, they need to be.
00:14:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that was not ultimately on my brain about that should be there to find a name.
00:14:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so you have like time freedom and lower stress, whatever there, so let's say you have these five things or that and then freedom of the framework is what you had.
00:14:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah, there you go.
00:14:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I like that because it is literally what we've been talking about that you do, right?
00:14:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're like you get people freedom and they get fulfilled, right?
00:14:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And that how they were fulfilled, right? So So even if we just take that name, right? So the freedom is you're gonna have time freedom, freedom from stress, freedom from whatever, right? there's five metrics there that you provide, which if you think about it, you could be like, these are really good things to do. And then fulfillment is the personal. Hey, I want, I want, right? So it's almost this separation between rocks, right? The rocks are the top line of tina metrics. And then the personal goals are personal rocks, right? So there's the overall rocks and there's personal rocks. And you can measure those both over span of time and you could look at them quarterly, right? You can do that, but they're also running. So implementation lives, for me, it's super simple. You just make a gravity form that has, right? The metrics are set for the level one. And then level two, you'd make a dedicated gravity form them, right? You kinda like you're gonna have a hundred clients at this level, right? are the people. people that you're only working with at this mark level. maybe you have a dozen, whatever it is. So making an individual Gravity Form for them, which is really just a duplicate of the first one. So let's say you make one for Mark, then you make one for Dan, and Dan's personal stuff is slightly different. But it's a Gravity Form for each of these. You send it out once a week via sequence, and they fill it out, it goes, it goes out a G sheet, and then you build the dashboard in a G sheet. So the G sheets tab two, the dashboards tab one, or to Google Data Studio, right? And then you can say, well, this one looks like this quarter. And then you can open it up to six months, right? You can start to look at it over time, it should be when they first start out, hey, what is your stress level one to five? You just gotta figure out what the measurement metrics are gonna be like, zero to five, what's your stress? Zero to five, what's your time freedom, right? And then they just answer that every week. And then every week, you just add them to that data's date. And you just have a sequence that peppers them. Hey, you gotta fill this out. You gotta do it every week. That's the only catch is getting them to do it. But I think they will because it's super simple. It will work on an iPhone because it's like a single page with a single form. And yeah, that would be very easy to implement. And then get Melissa to get Melissa into a pretty dark.
00:17:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was not planning. I was not trying to tap into damn brain for myself. was just sharing something that we could find a way to use for you.
00:17:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
that was amazing. Yeah, I mean, I literally saw it while you were talking. I was like, oh, I know exactly how you built this. But I mean, it's actually really good because it does. It does give you a visual representation of what's happened. This is literally what you look like. This is what your pitiful light shirt looked like, you know, six months ago.
00:17:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they're right. So that's part of it. So I feel like sometimes, like for the glens types of the world, which I, you know, whatever, but, but sometimes even the, you know, my ideal people get caught up in this isn't working, this isn't doing anything. And even Mark was like, okay, we don't really need to keep doing this because, and I'm like, well, we did get results when you did the work, but you stopped and you weren't answering questions anymore. And you were punting all the time. And so he came back, but what I think it helps do is also create, first of all, accountability level, because if people stop kind of showing up and they don't mean not coming to calls, but just not doing the work, right, or they take a dip, that will show up there. But also when they, I think it helps them buy into the process. And because we've had to. Yeah. So I have created tiny versions of this sporadically, very sporadically, which is the thing I'm really working on trying to improve and really create like a system and kind of a schedule that is still applicable to people's individual pace. But it's like, okay, here's the signal, we're here, here's the thing and kind of go that way. But anyway, but which is just showing mark, okay, look, this is or even you sometimes everybody really at some point, just like, okay, here's where we were, here's where we are, here's what you did to get there. Let's not forget to do this thing and let's continue to do that thing and whatever. it will be in a, you know, first of all, it will happen regularly. Second of all, it will happen with more clarity and the biggest thing is it will be in that visual, like we really learned the power of showing people.
00:20:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
equal numbers and data in terms that they're familiar with because of frequency because we keep showing it right because we keep interacting with that data so it becomes much more familiar so there's less of a wait what is this wait what does that wait what does that mean and then look at it instantly and they're like oh yeah okay realigned recentered moving on and also just focus for like okay this is the thing that works more of the thing that works less of all the other stuff well it's also every week they'd be sort of passively visiting or revisiting their goals which they're never doing it's never they're never thinking about it they never sit down and go oh that's right i'm trying to have less stress this week right yeah so and then when they start grading themselves then it's going to be like i am not doing this where i am we're like i am i'm crushing them You know, and whatever it is like you might be like how's your time blocking going and they'll be like I Know that would be my answer terrible. It's going terrible.
00:21:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know I Don't love it. It matters right now.
00:21:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean I do really good on the Tuesday. Went that's absolutely true I do not answer the phone. I just do whatever I want to do and those I actually worked I was telling someone about that the other day like wait what I go yeah You just you just don't answer the phone and then it's like comes a shock to you But it requires you picking it up and tapping it and if you don't pick it up nor tap it It's not answered and then you just move on. I don't want nothing the world's not burning down Whatever the phone calls about like just like I was telling Jeremy like weeks ago He was I think he was like why do you always say Thursday?
00:21:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
go because that's when I do calls Mm-hmm.
00:21:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What do you mean? don't I don't don't meet with people other than one and Thursday period End of story like occasionally occasionally on Fridays, but it's totally up to me But for the most part now, that's it's not available So oh wow good you could do this.
00:22:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No one schedules more important than yours new splash Right, and I'm gonna tell you this because okay, so a couple of things first of all Summertime with parents is a different kind of vibe not not just like for me, everybody's is a little bit different like you So I don't do major Stuff and I don't do as much accountability stuff during that time because It's more important to me That there's less stress in the in the home dynamic and just whatever so but September which is what we're coming upon like everything just goes super charge and push through and if you three and all three Q4 But the other thing let's see if I can remember where I was going just now oh okay so I've been having because okay so the thing that I was doing with Maria and still doing and we're actually gonna start talking once a week because she has lost her compass and I'm like I can hardly tell well yes I did say I know this bad um she's like the wheel of chaos they're like our dad died and he was okay so but I told her I can help you with that and so we're gonna talk regularly but um but you know I'll get to benefit from just her energy her experience and her brain and I'm dying to know if she's as legit as she makes herself out to be um I think she is and I kind of do too has made people millions and not really done well for herself yeah I have a feeling but also and I mean there's a lot to it but it's all really personal stuff that isn't appropriate for me to share, but I really think a previous marriage had a lot to do with that, though, so it wasn't just her.
00:24:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
She definitely let me know some of that.
00:24:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, so and I'm I'm not telling anything I don't think has been around enough. So, you know, that's why I'll say that little bit. But yeah, anyway, so I think that I'll help her. But what we're working on is so trying to figure out what can I do to get somebody a result quickly so that they're like, oh, she knows something I haven't been seeing and can get me some results, even if I don't hire her one-on-one, right? So group coaching and core stuff. So I picked something called timesheet homework, and I don't remember if you and I ever did it. We did it something around effective hourly rate, exercise when we like it was a few years ago, trying to figure out where your time went and where it should be going and what you're earning. Don't remember if I actually- They showed you the spreadsheet and it was called timesheet homework then. Now, I'm calling it time and profit maximizer, but what it is is you write down all the things that you do, what makes the most money, what makes you money, but is really tedious, has to be done, cannot not be done, but you hate doing it. What doesn't have to be done? We're just time being wasted, blah, blah, all that stuff. What are you great at? What do you suck at? What energizes you? What doesn't energize you? And then from that, people very clearly can figure out where they need to be delegating. What they should not be doing at all and almost, well, every single time, there's an aha of, I should be doing X way more because that's really what makes me money and I'm getting bogged down in the minutia every single time. So she went through it as we were talking about it and she had that exact epiphany. She's like, holy crap. I do almost none of what I should be doing most. But then I went to a previous, it wasn't even a client, it was so what I made my freedom systems which had this assignment in it 12 years ago and he went through it and he said this was worth the whole $97 course, 12 years ago. And it was this exercising them, so I just reached out to him. don't know if you know who Tyler Ellison is, and he helped us grow sheer strength labs with Ryan Moran and Tyler's also a person that Ryan never bothered thinking. But anyway, anyway, I was like, I remember you saying this to me once that that was that exercise alone was like life-changing and worth the price of the course. I'm like, I'm curious about staying power. I'm curious if that exercise, because my premise is that if I teach you how the fundamentals work, and I teach you how it works for you by asking you some questions and just telling you some stories that make you see how it can show up for you. If that information will stay with you and change you forever, like I think it does. That's been my experience, but I wanted that was over a decade ago and I haven't talked to him or worked with him for that long. So I wanted no staying power. He said 100 percent, it is life-changing. It affects him still, like he's still using everything I taught him. He offered to give me a video testimonial and I, so that's the thing about these fundamental processes, whatever. Anyway, so for you, this is the whole reason I said this to you though because you have, I don't know, you do get some resistance to some things. You're like, yeah, I should do that. And then you just like kind of notch lot. I don't do it, but I don't push. to you very much because you still you're always pacing something really well and to me that is the the most important thing like is if we're winning mostly winning I don't care about all the other ways things that we could be doing you know what I mean but I want I'm telling you this because I want you to buy into doing time-tracking maybe just really good just once a year for a little while or maybe twice a year because there's always so much of a shift in I don't know that there's so much of a shift and I don't know that it's always maybe because we've been working together so long and you know how time just kind of like collapses and ten years ago was like a minute ago and a minute ago was like ten years ago but I feel like sometimes in your cool things with cool people and puzzles that um and I do think that you're doing a pretty good job of prioritizing because here's where I think the priorities come up really well calls on specific days making music every week cool things with cool people not a lot of the tedious stuff so to me that that is the greater value but with the goal of getting that market share of another 71 that increase um with another 71 being the biggest lever for your freedom to continue to be whatever you want to be um do whatever you want to do and have the money for that and provide for your family and and it's gonna grow right girls are probably gonna probably get married probably have some kids who knows these days but um anyway Just thinking about a little bit more strategically, I don't think it's unstrategic, but even just more refinement basically, into where time is going for the next few years, I think that the time exercise, the time tracking and the time blocking with a little bit more specific intention, a re-evaluation of goals would be something really good for us to do next month, which is next week.
00:30:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But anyway, that's what I've been thinking about. Next month, which is next week, that's fun.
00:30:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, well, I mean, I don't want to, is it fine or is it, you know, yeah, whatever or is it like that's probably a good idea, probably useful.
00:30:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, as I've expressed multiple times throughout the years, I don't make goals, I make destinations, and then I manage to get there by saying that's where I want to go, right? Because I don't, I think my problem with goals is they usually have like a time associated with them, and I don't always to the tone associated with it, but I want the destination. So some things can be reached, you know, to switch from, I'm only doing all meetings on Monday, that was a week, right, right, to switch to, I'm only doing other calls on Thursdays, that took a little longer because I was like, I kept sort of letting it slide and saying yes to a Wednesday and yes to whatever. But then eventually I was like, no, I might do that. But that was probably a couple weeks, that making music on Fridays, right, that was like, okay, I'm, I did that with Sean, right, by meeting with Sean every Friday, I established that. So I established that through using somebody else. And then I have pretty much maintained it. mean, now I make music all over the place in Fridays. So, yeah, I'm, you know, I was just thinking about it like yesterday. It was like, I let something But that I was working with those dent guys and then the owner came back and then I just told my buddy out You know what? I don't want to do this And he's like what I go. Yeah, just don't want to do this. What you mean? it really boils down to like it's not my idea Therefore, I mean it is but it's not it actually I said it's not really my idea Although it kind of is but really the problem is When it was when I was working with you as the person of the outside, it's fine But the only way this works is if it's my idea and then I have a willing participant And a willing participant has to provide feedback. They have to answer questions They have to use they have to use the things. Yeah, and if they're not gonna use the things It's just not gonna work So I was like if you come back into the fold if and if that's if that's nine months from like great We'll pick it up in nine months, but I'm not working. I'm not working anymore. I'm done Even like okay And whether he comes back or not, I don't care. Right. I don't really care. And then it's like we're getting closer and closer to, you know, fan flowies. We got a couple more things. just sent the web. I'm going back and forth with the dudes right now. I'm building the website template. great. And now I'm trying to get them to do this version for me. Let's see. I literally just sent him all your emails for me on the phone. Hopefully he understands what I'm saying. But it sounds like he does. And then it's like, okay, if we can roll that out, that's where I'm like, all right. I want to then, and then I still need bases. Eric is like, no dude, it's happening. This is really happening. It's like cool. So those guys are just banging away on code with rank. They didn't even meet this week. They're like, we're just doing code. That's fine by me. You guys all agree. You and Frank agreed. like, don't let's not be let's just stay in Jira. It's like, okay, cool. So that's going. Yeah, he hooked up Jira. I've never used it, but it's for coders. It's code or project management. Oh, okay. Yeah, it's like a whole other thing. Very interesting company worth a gazillion in these two dudes start and also started. So it's like, I'm like, all right, but I mean, I'm still it's still the same thing. Another 71 grow another 71 which PS is now up to 3.5 million ARR. So it's definitely grown this year. My stupid frickin some of my GTM stuff is not working. Some of stuff I wanted to do is maybe not gonna work. I'm going back and forth with one of Mercy's four guys who's great. They definitely know their stuff. So but I also am not working on that today. So I'm still working out some of that stuff. Mushy did do my new customer thing, and it's exactly what I wanted, so we'll make sure that that's tracking correctly. And then I was working, I'm just, I'm still trying to, I gotta get that tracking in place, and then figure out, you know, if I could figure out where the new customers come from. And then we're still dealing with this weird year. And then I think Bobby, Bobby sent out something next year. There's 25 school releases next year, which is called The Hook. Yeah, that's insane. like, okay. And those are always good for us.
00:35:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I was like, okay.
00:35:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Next year could be great. And then I started, I think I'm getting sales on some of the new products and some ads I put up. The SEO's going really good with a curd. Um, yes, I mean. I'm still just focused on like, I really just want to do like, another 71 basis and think blowing, or mom, right? And that's it, if I can get those three, yeah, any semblance of whatever. And then if Kamala gets up high, it Kamala gets elected and they put this cap game thing in place, we are not selling another 71, so yeah, we know the red event, so we'll just sit on that.
00:36:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good job.
00:36:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We will not be paying you any additional types of revenue, that is 40% F you.
00:36:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's crazy. it's not case in point, our conversation evolves so much, but to the point of just the principles, priorities, values, whatever, like, is the foundation, like that's the initial foundation, that's the first fundamental thing that we talk about, because for me, okay, for example, morning routines, and I talked to Mark about gratitude, mostly because he was Eor and just woo.
00:37:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Which is pretty much gone now. I know, I know, but let me let me get through this whole train of thought because I'm not I'm just saying talk, flash in and losing it really fast. Oh, yeah.
00:37:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, yes, it is mostly gone, but that didn't work for him, right? It was not his value. So he had to have something that was his value. The dog was his value. old day was his value spending time with her. And so he took her for walks. Well, she's gone and he's still walking and it was crazy that he's like, I walked five miles. was like, that's like nine miles, but I was like, yeah, that was that was wild. So but anyway, but you when it so that thing, right, is you're like, I don't, I don't set goals. But but you kind of do their. just not most people's goals. Yours are cool things with cool people. That's not a destination and it doesn't have a date. But it does have a spectrum, the spectrum of the quality of the cool things and the cool people. And people have fallen off the spectrum on that path. And like Francesca, like Glenn, things like that. Like this thing that you're doing with the guy, the dent thing, it is a refinement in terms of clarity about what you want and what you don't want. You do three examples. The Monday meetings, only having calls on particular days. I can't remember what the other things were anymore, because my brain. But everything that you listed, I'm like, we had a conversation. And in the middle of that, because you're like this, each of these, three things took a week. And I said, in the middle of a conversation, you're like, okay, this is what's gonna happen. You made a decision and then you pulled the trigger. And then next week, I was talking to you, you're like, yeah, I did this. And I was like, what the? But it still came from conversations about things like, where is your time going? And how do you feel about where time is going? So it's really not very different. The only difference is I have through and do that. And, you know, time blocking, like, I don't really do time blocking. I don't do it in my calendar. I do it mentally. And it's very similar to you because my value is, I don't want to live in a calendar, even though I'm aware of it. But I am looking at it constantly. But I choose the things that matter most. And then I make sure that those, like, those are my big rocks, right? Those are the things that get the most time. there's room for other things, there's room for other things. But what matters most always is getting done. So anyway, yeah, so we could just like have a little bit of a conversation, go through the exercise. What I think would happen is rather than like sending any more specific goals, it's just an evaluation of is the way that you're spending your time right now, and I'm not talking about time blocking, but case in point, the example of where's your time going, where's your energy going. I don't want to have calls on these certain days. It's really me off. I'm not going to do that anymore. So that's the kind of conversation I'm more thinking about having with you is a modified version. But there's a foundational process that I use that helps me to be able to kind of facilitate that conversation, but you're still the one that shapes it based off of how you want, how things matter to you.
00:41:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. The only thing I would say is that full of things with cool people is a principle using your terminology. That's not a principle.
00:41:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's really principle.
00:41:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. And I do have no drama principle. Oh, yeah. And then the goals are like row 1% a year. You know, work on program, yeah. Yeah.
00:41:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Goals. 1%. I already know that I'm just writing them down again, because then I'm going to create my thing.
00:41:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah. And it's like a 1% market.
00:41:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:41:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. I know what it was. Yeah.
00:41:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I'm reminding myself. Oh, yeah, which means being clear on what the market is and all that. Yeah. Principle slash values. Yeah. So drama thing is a big thing. Cool things with people. Solving puzzles is another one though. I feel like that's kind of both a value and a goal. It's that you always have a good puzzle to work on. Because I don't agree that goals, OK, goals are specific, measurable, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, But, I don't think that they have to have, I don't think they have to be finite-based.
00:42:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes, because it is the T time. don't even know what it is, right? Time-based or something. What? The T in smart is time.
00:42:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's time-based.
00:42:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right the 1% is for you
00:43:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It just doesn't have an entire specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time bound, but for me, the time bound that just sounds so risky, right? But for me, the time is not relevant if the goal is growth and expansion in that thing, which is how I set my goals. It isn't that I want to arrive at a destination. It's that I want to be further than I am now, and I consistently want to be further than I am now, because my destination is probably greater than I can even comprehend.
00:43:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, you could twist it, right? Tweak it and be like, yeah, it's time bound. And you could say with regard to not a deadline, right? So it's time bound in that you're going to look at this every quarter. You're going to look at this every month, right? So you could sort of, it doesn't, the time bound doesn't have to be a deadline. I guess, I mean, I just don't have deadlines for the most part.
00:44:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Exactly.
00:44:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Or the big ones.
00:44:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And one of the things that I tell people too, especially if we have something that's kind of obscure and a lot of the things that we want are obscure, especially when you're paying attention to this energy and when you're just like, stuff is happening and I'm just here for it, right? But you're really intentional. You're on purpose, you're doing the work. It's not nothing, but there's a little bit more intangible that's happening. so I like to tell people don't, you know, look back from a year from now. What was life like a year ago? What are you more clear on now? What is improved now? What are you more confident about now? do you have? What less stress do you have now? How's your schedule better? Like all of these different things. If you look back a quarter from now. Six months from now, sometimes it's not that big of a deal, but a year from now, a year ago, right? There's almost always some things that you can pick out and go, this is so much better than that. This is how much I've grown since a year ago, which is one of the benefits for me of getting to work with people so long as I can look at that and go night and day difference from last year on this or that or whatever. Anyway, reinforcing the not a deadline, but more like a journey thing. Yeah, okay. So you have to everything really for me for like where you're at with Mercer. This is almost being done and let's go release things that's gonna be where like, did you confirm that? How, what did you hear?
00:45:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Where did you hear it from? Hey, I CPA puts it out, right? they run them so that they they released the 2025 schedule. So he like sent a screen cap of the year or whatever.
00:46:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's like the thing, huh? That's crazy.
00:46:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. then, you know, is that a double? What is that? Oh, God.
00:46:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:46:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
triple? I think it's more than double. like double plus one, roughly.
00:46:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's crazy.
00:46:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And well, and then they've been down because of all the code.
00:46:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:46:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, yeah, it's certainly more than this year by a mile. I mean, there's only been like half that many this year. It's seven or eight maybe so far. Or not even that many so far. There's one coming up and then there's one in October or no, the next one is not until October. So there'll be like a two month month and a half and nothing. Whereas with 25, it's averaging two a month, which is Definitely not all of it. It used to be these would be even more sparse Back in the day That's when we did these huge Sailed days.
00:47:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, they probably realized that there's a similar correlation for them too And I think it's a result of having six sections now and not four Yeah Except yeah, I'm a success to Stacy because I look across as something from her and I don't think she's seen it Okay, so I'm back Adler separate Do have a recipient there I Don't know what it's talking about Okay, um, perfect wedding timeline.
00:48:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
How's that going? So, Abhishek has been sending Norio all bugs, and Norio said that he thinks he'll be ready for some beta testers. Next month. Uh, the I sent Greg, I think Eric built it. So, we have the seething chart things. As Norio, alright, what are we doing? How do I get a lead from a seething chart over? He explained that's Eric and I. Eric, I'm pretty sure he definitely is working on it because I saw some stuff today and was like, that's going to be Eric. Um, so this morning I sent the design, the layout and design ideas to Greg with the scene chart site. Norio's like, you can search and read these now. Then that's what I will do. So, Greg got that and then, we'll follow that up with Rob. I haven't really thought about the site for that, but it's going to be a better site than what we have for the current version because we're licensing, you know, it's not off. So I've never been motivated to try to generate a lead for the other side or anything like that. If they happen to happen, if they don't, they don't really care. But my plan is to generate leads to the free seating chart site, get their wedding date, all that stuff. Renau will stick it into the Wolfr Active Campaign and, you know, market is free seating chart, put them into a drip sequence, but depending on their wedding date, they'll go into the app, they get complete access to the even chart, and then they'll see that, you know, it has, you know, online feature, but it's grayed out, but they can purchase not from, I don't think they can purchase from within the app. But they can link to purchase and then it will unlock the whole app for them based on their current user name password So yeah, super interesting to see right now to talk to anybody just go generate leads Yeah Yeah then just put to you know put the other the map on that.
00:50:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, there's the pop-up all I can so Every time we've converted to selling and we being different clients Selling like up selling inside of a membership area with that like you can see the other things that you don't have access to Either it's great out over the lock screen and then you click on it goes to the sales page or a Java script You know unlock is here whatever Compulsions so that's that just increased exponentially
00:51:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We need to auto-expire them on their wedding table.
00:51:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you going to tell them now, should I give you a reminder for Stacy?
00:51:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
A reminder. So, Bobbi, wait what?
00:51:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so like the menu items is here.
00:51:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He did it. He said it to me. Yeah, he's like, here it is. I probably didn't look at it.
00:52:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you forward it? So you need to, I'd really like to I don't think I only have a general and idea of money execution channel that I am part of.
00:52:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Huh? It's not in my slack. He said, it's a world I have to go find it.
00:53:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK.
00:53:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's what it's.
00:53:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Super eyes. What's the status?
00:53:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, so they don't get it. And they're like, they really, they just want their cake and eat it too. And I'm like, yeah, that's not going to happen. So they, we had like a couple exchanges. then they wrote me back like another lying email and I glanced at it and I'm like, I ain't going to have permission. But it boiled down to like, they, they, they think the value is in the effort and work that they've done and the quality of the code. I'm like, yeah, no, that's not how it works. wish it worked like that. So then, and then they're like, oh, you know, and then you're going to become. I'm a competitor, so I'm trying to figure out. I haven't put a lot of thought into it, but some thought into it. So they wanted, I guess I'll prioritize this. They wanted 420 grand for a copy of the code. I'm like, are you high? Like, what are you talking about? I go, that's 38x. Nobody gets that. Nobody gets that kind of multiple. So then I told them, no, your business is like stub, 100,000 a year. Your value is more based on a seller's discretionary earnings formula. Here's that. Go ahead and run that. And PS, the X on that is one to two based on your gross revenue.
00:54:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:54:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, I mean, it's not even, it's worth, you know, max 20 grand max as it is. And then they're like, well, you know, then you're going to cannibalize us. I'm like, cannibalize what? You don't have anything. So they just believe in the idea, right? you don't. You really don't, as if you did, you wouldn't have a job. Right? you're want your want to outdoors. Like I'm not going to say that obviously. Right? all right. Right. What I pointed out is like, there's also the risk of overnight you could be shut down. Overnight. Right? This is against the terms of service service, um, basically. And you can be shut down overnight. Payment gateway could be shut down overnight. You guys experienced it twice. Business shut down. So I'm like, there's not, it's very risky. So I have to figure out a way where like, they can participate in the upside. So it's either like, okay, you, you give me a hand. This was my original offer. I want a non-commercial license meaning I won't sell it. So I won't sell it and therefore I'm not competing with you. You can sell it. I'm not going to sell it. I'm only and I'm only going to and I'll pay you X per month guaranteed. But it could be like I do a commercial license and then so they get X per month guaranteed and then they get a percent of account like I'd have to figure out a formula like all right I'm gonna pay you a thousand bucks a month and four thousand bucks a month that gets me 500 active users and then when I get over 500 active users you get 5% of everyone over 500 you know I mean like something like that and then and then we decide on a value like we have to get a real value so that at any time I can buy my copy. I'll pay you to customize it which is 20 grand. So pay 20 grand, I'll pay you thousand bucks a month and now get me 500 users and then I'll pay you on if it goes gangbusters you guys get to Participate on the upside and but then at any time I can buy that code base off you for a fixed amount And or we decide to fix them out and I say every time I pay you I'm buying it Right, so you're gonna get 200 grand least don't yeah Yeah, yeah, it's like a lease on sort then you'll get the 200 grand, but at any time I could accelerate that So if we're down to a value of 190 I could just give you 190 and I'm out So something like or I mean but then yeah, so something like that and I haven't obviously I've thought about it a little but I haven't thought about it a ton and I just It's like there's no that the you know effect of hourly rate There's no effect of hourly rate for me to be like I gotta get back to those guys then If you add into the mix that mark supposedly and see this, believe them, they somehow stumbled upon running ads, I'm not sure this is exactly right, but I think this. So they found out that if you log into Instagram desktop, not that after your phone, and you boost a post through the desktop, in some way that's different than definitely different than running it out on Facebook and, you know, doing it that way, but also different from boosting the post internally within the app. They don't know how or why it's different, but it's different in that they're getting followers now for 30 cents, and super as gets a follower for 19 cents. So I'm like, that's not a bad trade-off, right? And it's completely legal, like a better term. So they figured that out like like over the weekend. So I think they've been doing it for a couple of days. And now they're like, all right, now let's do the process of manually DMing them. So part of me was like, the part that Instagram doesn't like is if you auto DM someone, and we are not doing that, we never done that. That was what I was going to have to supervise that into it. So then I was like, well, what if we just created an auto DM-er, right? So if we created an auto DM-er that doesn't look like an auto DM-er, right? And we'll be really smart about it, have it just randomly send DMs, switch the DMs up, but I gave that to the JD Funnels dude, I thought Spotify out there said, hey, look into this. The only thing I think the only problem with it is I think it needs to be a desktop app, because it can't be on a server. So this builds back to, and maybe we don't need to build super eyes, maybe we just need need to build an auto dm or app that's on your desktop and it just does that so you run ads and use that and then that's totally free like it's it's included with whatever oh yeah and then I download the dm or yes I haven't thought it through that frontal right now so I like oh wait that's it right there that's what we need to do and then we've got the other devs that I found before for the super ride but when I was going to build my own thing that might be the plane I'm probably causing a couple hundred bucks super simple and then we could just test it internally hmm it's a good Dina I told you my magic is asking questions everybody does that be lifting the sides yeah well that's little thing right I don't no one sits around and asks me what I'm doing
01:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
or why you're doing it.
01:01:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yeah, but that's actually the play right there. You know what? That's not going to cost $420,000. Probably not going to cost a grand.
01:01:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I mean, there's so many different angles to it and it's like, well, I can be your competitor that you get money from or I can be your competitor that you don't. Not that you're actually the competitor, but you know what I mean? And there's other things. There's so many angles to it, but sometimes narrow minds can see the light and sometimes they can't. But regardless, you've got opportunities for days. There's so many different ways around it.
01:01:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's okay. It's okay. have a call at 1.30 and thirdly..s.
01:01:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We met with Josh at eight.
01:02:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And he, uh, he's like, yeah, we can do that. He, it's unreal how good he is. Mark and I, so I like, Mark, you need to go this tall because you get the bookkeeping side. And so we walked through it, you know, over a half hour or so. And Josh is like, yep, yep, yep, we can do that. We can build that and then Mark out of nowhere. I don't know if this is from, I think I only sent it to you. And I sent it to him too, where I was like, hey, we got to work on like the on track, I'll track dashboard. I thought that was just you, but maybe he was on there. He brought that up because I want to build the mega marketing dashboard or something and just like, that's a great day. That's a good, good job, Mark, the MMD. So Josh is going to build the thing that we wanted to talk about. And then this MMD and then he showed us some apps that he has that are super cool that I'm like, I don't know if Mark got it. I'm like, it's so funny when I look at something, I go, oh, that's interesting.
01:03:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, if it's ever possible, I would love to be on a call with Joshua. I can just see it firsthand and download all of that. Or if you have a recording, cause I only have like this tiny glimpse into what he can do. But, um, like, that sounds amazing. Instead, but he could do more than maybe I could ask other questions. That would be that we've never had an option to get a lot of this stuff. Like we've been working with Mark for over three years and it took all of this time to find Josh. And who knows what Josh was doing. Speaking of like synergy and divine stuff and things are happening that we can't control or even bring into play. We couldn't make Josh appear and Josh have his skill and his knowledge. We had no control all of that. All we could control is what do we do when we need a Josh?
01:03:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You know what I mean? And what's crazy is that he was in the middle of this random video. I was watching and I was like I had to find that guy so it was like that's how How did you find him? I was I was researching something about Lidify because I'm like I'm not doing this I'm not gonna do it. Mark could do it and then whatever and then They were like in he was like being interviewed I don't know but it was like an interview YouTube video with like four views and I watched it and I was like Who is this guy and then I figured out one of my zoomed in on the screen Or they said the firm or they said his last name. I was like that's it's such a newbie last name and I found him Through his face and then I you know them. Okay, man.
01:04:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you do this and he's okay? Insane when you think about just I know you being you, which is let me go look at that and and That you don't disregard somebody because they've got like almost no views because some of the smartest people have like no Following on Facebook and they are insanely smart and very good at teaching how to do certain things, whatever.
01:05:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
anyway, he literally was on the call going, this guy is such a score. This morning, I was like, he is such a score. So quick, the thing that he showed us was we built this app for referring out his doctor refer or I'm sorry, it's for referring to doctors, right? So think of it in that context, like, yes, you have your doctors that you're referring to, but this is also to maybe refer to a new doctor. It's integrated into Lidify. And let's say that you're like, oh, this person means a pain management doctor. It goes to Google, you put in their, it pulls their addressing from their matter record. And then on the, so that's on the left side on the right side to Google map. And it pulls up all the pain management clinics in around that area. And I'm like, wait, what?
01:05:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, isn't that how you would build your doctor network, Mark? it's also how doctors find out their competition and that's very relative to the new plan I have yeah so I was like wow that's slick and then this other thing he had is this auto mailer like physical mail and you yeah and it integrates with i don't know did you recall no i don't know if did it was his car no it was it's google google so i don't even know if you ask if it's recorded yeah yeah or he would send a video on it okay um i want to hear about all of that stuff because whatever we can use for mark also mark is in business with the client that he gave me and there's probably room for dan in there too and something in terms of marketing because that's not where they should be spending their time like he does his own seo like why are you doing your own seo like the money you make that that's dumb but also, you know, you can always just find great SEO, but I'm pretty sure he does not do great SEO. Anyway, there's just holy crap, Josh. Yes, I wanna know more about Josh. And if you have more calls, either please record it or can I come because I wanna see that brain?
01:07:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I don't normally talk to him. This he requested, and I was like, Mark's gonna be there. Mark made it sound so complicated, and I was like, I don't think I was that complicated.
01:07:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the point, yes.
01:07:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I was like, and then, but it does, it's gonna involve manual labor.
01:07:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, Mark. You're crazy. That's exactly what he ate.
01:07:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right, your employees are gonna actually have to do tasks, weekly, gasp.
01:07:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yes, that is the issue. Anyway, okay. That is awesome. I forget what you realized you figured out, but I know you figured it out, and you won't forget when it comes to what you figured out was supervised.
01:08:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, do you mind? Yeah, totally. I need to build our own.
01:08:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, because I can go back to my notes and get that if you need a reminder.
01:08:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I got it.
01:08:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, well, sir. Okay, don't forget ideas for like a gift basket. That's pretty much going to be all about Denise. We'll probably figure out something for you too.
01:08:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay, It's the other D&D call.
01:08:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got two air pods and you probably drop them in the dog bowl.
01:08:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, but they're the ones that everyone's complaining about. No, actually, that's already broke.
01:08:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm on another set.
01:08:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Mary is using the ones that you got using the one.
01:08:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's one that works.
01:08:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't think I dropped them in the dog bowl. eat the pieces of a shelf. I told that to Josh amazing. Oh, I just got air pods and like be gentle.
01:09:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, don't forget to think about the Denise basket and then, you know, have a great weekend, Labor Day weekend.
01:09:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, thanks. Oh, I think all the music I get canceled, maybe I'll probably all of them, except Mark.
01:09:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah.
01:09:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's what I meant. I don't, I don't, yeah, yeah.
01:09:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not coming that way.
01:09:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh my God. I mean, it's a base. It's a basis meeting, but it's really not inviting you, but yeah, totally. Okay. You know, I'll be late.

Hello.
00:00:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Hey, Tina.
00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, how are you?
00:00:10 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Good.
00:00:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. good. So it'll just be us, not Patrick today, because he's on vacation and he just messaged last night about it.
00:00:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:00:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's all you, all the focus on you today.
00:00:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Nice. Sorry.
00:00:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How, how was it gone since last week? Any thoughts and ponderings about what we talked about before we get to like the tasks and assignments?
00:00:47 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, I just kind of went ahead and did it. I met with all my team members one on one.
00:00:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tell me about that.
00:00:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, it went well. Had a. Very well, you know, the whole reason I wanted to do it was to me with a very anyway, but she ended up being sick so I didn't get clearance of this morning It was good I got some good feedback the way I structured it I kind of like Asked them how they were doing and of course they gave me the generic answers, you know pretty good or you know Happy or whatever and then I got a little further asked them what their biggest stress was Right now and I got some good answers and then So usually it was like on the client side and then as I gave it we discussed that different solutions we could come up with and Then asked them, you know, what about the firm from the firm side you're experiencing stresses that I could help you relieve or any anything that we can do. so I got some good feedback on that as well. And then I set some goals with them. I wanted to have three goals for the next month for each one of them. So we set some goals. And then for coaching, I finished with coaching points. I just kind of went through a couple of things I noticed, but it kept it really positive.
00:02:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what I would love to do, what I think would be super insightful and helpful, is just to go over those in details for you to share what it was like, what you learned, your read on them, how they felt. Because like I said in the beginning, it's really an information. gathering process. So, basically, imagine you have, have you ever played with Legos? Okay, so you're dumping out all the Legos and you're basically taking inventory, and let's say you're doing something where you're just building it from your mind, not necessarily from a plan or schematic, and so you're figuring out what you've got to work with, so you can kind of build in your mind first, knowing what pieces you're working with. So, you know, some of the pieces are the people, but inside the people, so let's say the people are colors, and one's red, but there's different shapes of red, and one's yellow, but there's different shapes of yellow, and each of the different shapes would be their different skills, talents, abilities, weaknesses, any of those things, right? So, we're really just figuring out what do we have to build with, and it will be the people and all the nuance inside of them, and then it'll also be, obviously, the combination, like, where. not just building a red thing or a yellow thing, but so if we're, you know, we could do that together so that we're leveraging, you know, both of our different skill sets and see what we can come up with. What you think about that?
00:04:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I think be great. Yeah, I think initially, you know, I was a safe space. know, I wasn't like evaluating him for their next raise or anything like that.
00:04:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure.
00:04:39 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
But I think, yeah, that's what that's where I want to go. I want to be able to use these one ones as like, you know, a growth audience experience.
00:04:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel like um, very was a little bit more open this time with that intention that you set? Do you feel like she
00:05:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
end up at all more than normal. Yeah, a little bit. So, you know, what, it was a little bit different with her because I knew that that was one of the points we have touched on last last time we met. And so I made sure to emphasize the fact that, you know, this is a safe space, you know, I know that, you know, you know, I worked and passed four terms where anytime you were a little bit vulnerable, that was used as to, you know, those weaponized against you, then down the line. And I wanted to make sure I wanted to make clear that this wasn't this. This was just a way for me to, to be in touch with her and understand how I could support her, how I could help her. Set goals and how I could make sure she was happy here. And so you said that explicitly? Yeah.
00:06:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how did now reading both energy expression and words, how was that received?
00:06:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I could like, I could see her body language, she relaxed a lot more.
00:06:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She is way more like, almost like her shoulders when come up here. It's like down here is choosing. You know how big that is for that to happen. So you know what that means is that she trusts you that what you say is true. Yeah, she had an immediate response. What you said she trusted. That's, it's really important for you to understand that, that how to forgive me. Sometimes I get emotional when I think about people and our hearts and our spirits. and the things that we're going through because we are we are people and this is a big deal and our fears are a big deal our traumas are a big deal and they show up everywhere they show up in the workplace so when a person by default does not feel safe for them to come into contact with a person who can tell them they're safe and they believe it that is very powerful and I want you to remember what I told you about how you can be a different person for these people do you remember what I told you about yourself? I remember we talked about how I could be the safest person to these people because you are safe because you are kind because you do care um not Not because you just want to be that way, but I was pointing out to you that you actually are that way. And so what I want to show to you is now you've received a validation that is in Tina's just making an opinion and she doesn't know me, but she's guessing that these things. You just got validation from somebody that you've been working with, because that physical symbol of shoulders dropping and you can see that she relaxed 100% validates what I said is that you are perceived as safe. However, what I want you to also understand is that a lot of times we can do things somewhat obscurely and meaning that it's not crystal clear. Obviously, I know you know what obscure means, but I want to elaborate on my meaning. You can get a sense of something that you haven't dug into. you. So you haven't specifically identified it and brought it into crystal clear view. For example, Viri could may have sensed that you're a safe person, but you didn't give a clear enough signal to her to say, I am a safe person. I want you to feel safe. And so she felt it, but she didn't believe it per se. And generally speaking, we can feel safe around people, not know that they're safe for a very long time. And especially if you have the experience that you have trusted people in the past, and then they haven't been safe, you're going to doubt that your perception is accurate anyway. So she was able to pair her internal and intuitive perception of you being safe with your words confirming it. she believed it immediately. Hence, the physical experience and vision. visual symbol that she had relaxed and leaned into her the little bit. Does that make sense?
00:10:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, yeah.
00:10:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I want you to understand how powerful that is, because if you know that about yourself, Lorenz, then, but also if you know that there are people like Viri, and there's many, many, many, many, many of them, the majority, who don't feel like people that they are supporting that too in any kind of way are safe, who may not feel like men in the workplace are safe, or any of that, that you can give them a clear signal, I'm safe for you. I want you to feel safe. How you feel is important to me. want you to communicate what you need, what you think, It matters to me. I value your opinion. I value your presence on the team. I value, I mean, it could be your children. It could be other people in other places in your life. But you have because you are kind, because you care, but also because you're intelligent and because you have a good work ethic. That makes you rare. That's not the average person, friends. I've worked with so many people and I was just born weird watching people and intuitively recognizing them. I had grown people speaking to me as a child, forgetting that I was a child, talking to me and unburdening.
00:11:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, I'm not normal either.
00:11:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I've learned to recognize people and I speak boldly because I'm open to the fact that that I could be wrong, but I haven't been yet, and I won't be surprised when I am, well, I probably will be surprised when I'm wrong, but not because of me, but because of people and because of patterns and because of consistency. People really do give a lot of signals.
00:12:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's just most people aren't looking for them.
00:12:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm always looking for them. That's part of my bad for me, have actually become a superpower, which is actually true for a lot of people.
00:12:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So anyway, that's just all that interesting talking to you because like as an introvert, it's sometimes hard for you to express what I'm thinking, but it sounds like you're kind of like you can kind of interpret it before I can get the right words out.
00:12:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And it may not surprise you, but that's actually, I think it's probably one of my favorite gifts. And I get told that a lot is that there are things that people think. And they maybe have never even put it towards themselves yet. But I say it and I'm like, Oh, that's exactly what I was thinking. Or that's what I was feeling or like I had that awareness or whatever. So what you gave to me, even though I've already received it, it always helps me to receive that validation. So what I'd like you to keep in mind too, is that you have the ability to give validation to other people as well. And to take it when you receive it, because that is it's power. It gives people more confidence when they get a clear signal that this is true. So do you re needed that you gave a tour? And she gave you a clear signal of what I told you is that you are uniquely considered safe and trustworthy. So Oh, you told her you were safe because you were already received as trustworthy, she believed it. So those are two signals about yourself that were really important to receive. And I promise you, she's not the only one that thinks that. So that's really important and awesome and good job. Like, I didn't think that would be that fast, but that's how great you are. it does me no good to patronize or placate people. Anyway, if that would be counterproductive, I'd be out of a job very quickly because it'd be the emperor has their clothes.
00:14:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You know what I mean?
00:14:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So I really, I really am impressed that you were able to have one conversation and watch shoulders drop. That specific signal is really, really potent. Wow, I also couldn't even like apply on the wall and watch that happen. That'd be amazing. Okay, so go ahead.
00:15:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It was pretty, you know, a pre rewarding conversation. think she's, you know, she has so much to bring to the team and I've been frustrated with, you know, not being able to suss that out. I'm excited for the next few weeks to see how she kind of grows and is able to kind of trust me as an attorney and can bring her own input to our team.
00:15:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. I am so excited about that also, but I want to remind you, though, that she will need the consistency. So she'll need those signals again and again and again, because a lot of times people will declare who they are with their words, but it's when they support what they declare through their actions that we really know for sure. And I'm sure that you've already told her, like I said, she probably sensed it. This was just. the confirmation. But my point is that you'll want to reiterate that either explicitly or implicitly in the conversation that you have, even just saying things like, I'm so glad that we're opening up a little bit more and talking because I value what you say, just moving right along. not having to make a big thing about it, but a tiny little signal that I met what I said, this is on my mind, this is real, you know, let's keep going. And when she does say something, and it was, you know, more than what you would have expected before, I was just like, wow, I'm so glad that you're sharing more because I really feel like I'm, you know, from your mind and your experience. And, you know, just little signals like that, sincere, obviously, but I know that they will be. So then not only will she just continually be open but that should probably spread to other so if anybody else is needing anything and you say hey guys I need you to open up more a little bit and maybe Viri speaks up and goes yeah I did and it was awesome you know yeah super excited about this you're awesome good job good job good job and you just got right on it I love that and I love that you're all stealthy like I'm gonna talk to Viri but I don't want her to feel worried so I'm gonna talk to everybody well yeah I think you know the other interviews were good in their own rights for different reasons but Viri was the principal target yeah yeah but but you put in the effort to go through the whole thing first of all to consider and to not want to make her afraid and so to take time to talk to everybody which obviously is a benefit and wisdom anyway but that's the difference between bosses and leaders Lorenz and you just do it it because you're like, well, of course, duh, like, what else am I going to do? But, but I want you to understand that is not how most people operate. And it, it's what makes you really great and why people feel safe is because you default to that into caring and concerning about people. And they're like, what is this? That's not, that's not how people normally are. So good job.
00:18:24 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
job. Thank you. Thank you.
00:18:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Making me blush a little bit. Well, I am sincere.
00:18:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I promise you.
00:18:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good job. Okay. So did we learn anything? Did she share anything with you that that we can use?
00:18:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Did you have any coaching points? Let's get into the nitty-gritty of everyone. Yeah. So I guess that's where I'm very, let's talk about her. Okay. So generally, she's very happy. She's, she's, I think she was, she, she explained to me that, Initially, she was a little bit, she didn't know how to fit into the sweet lawyer's system because she came from a place where all the jobs were very segregated. so she would only do one type of task. Whereas here, it's kind of like all hands on deck. She likes that she's finding her way through that and that she's getting to a point where she's able to feel helpful, especially at the end of the mountain, things like that. And she likes that she's growing a lot faster than she expected.
00:19:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's living a lot quicker than she expected. I love that.
00:19:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
One of the stress points right now is she wishes she had more time. She asked her, do you feel like you have too many cases that you're too many tasks for the cases that you and John had. And she says, not necessarily, I just wish that there is a way for me to come in earlier in the morning. So like once we get, I can get some of those tasks done before we get phone calls raining in. And she said, well, I might look into some daycare for my kids, my younger kids that don't have school so that I can come in earlier and told her, know, she needs to stay later, that's fine too, know, she doesn't have to work around her schedule within reason. And then we talked, but I do think like it's also, this might be a product of, well, she's still fairly new, she's still learning quite a few new tasks. And I think some things will get quicker as she gets more experience with them. I'm also thinking about talking to John about making sure he doesn't all flow too much to her. Then, you know, we had a conversation a little hard to hard about, you know, like this is not a place where she needs to be on guard all the time, she can make mistakes and we'll work on them to get others, this is a safe place to be, know, she doesn't need to look for perfection. And we set some goals, I told her, you know, she had a hard time setting goals, and so we kind of looked at certain things together. I looked at the cases from her and John and they have, there's too many cases in collecting meds right now, collecting med status. So I asked her what would be a good goal for, to move cases from collecting meds to ready for demand and she set a goal for it to do 20 cases by next month. I think it's a little bit ambitious, I'm honest, but I don't want to, she wants to do 20, I'm not going to like tell her it's too, too many. Right.
00:22:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So elaborate on that for a little bit, did you say collecting meds to ready for demands?
00:22:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:22:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And like meds being like medical like reports and doctors and medical records and billing. Medical records and billing.
00:22:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. Kind of the biggest bottleneck in my case.
00:22:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Now. And her goal was to do what? To get 20.
00:23:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
In what time period 30 days, so we said goals for 30 days. I think 20 I say she gets to between 10 and 15.
00:23:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that would be very impressive. Where is she out right now?
00:23:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I don't have any prior data, but I know on average that's about how much people are able to get because there's so many things outside of your control zone. If the hospital says we'll get to it when we get to it, apart from following up every other day, there's not much you can do to hurry that along.
00:23:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm wondering, so I talked to you in Samantha that one time and we talked a little bit about tracking time and she was definitely not interested in it and everybody operates differently. That's okay. This isn't that. picking lots of other things. But what I will tell you, is I haven't even marked it this exercise, although he pushed off on it for a long time first. But imagine that our time is, so imagine we're a store, and the store operates, and it has a certain amount of stuff that it can sell and make money with, right? There's this fixed, that's your inventory. Well, your business is the tasks that you do. It's rather than items on a shelf. It's the supply is your time, and the things that have to get done. And you have a certain amount of hours to work with. And that's it. So by tracking time, if we were to track everybody's time for a couple of weeks, this has nothing to do with micromanagement. This has to do with finding out what Legos are in the back. That's all it is. It's understanding where things are. are going, how long it takes, and looking at it and zooming out and going. I wonder what would happen if we changed the order of operations. I wonder what would happen if we changed who's doing what or when, but until we don't even know what questions to ask about how we can do it better, until we break down how everybody is spending their time. And if they're not afraid to share it, if they're not afraid to really track it. So for example, you've got Mike, Mike, we know Mike is late, we know Mike takes longer breaks, but we also know that Mike is bomb at getting just distributions, and that he likes doing it, and it doesn't stress him out. And so, you know, imagine everybody's a stick, and on one end there's a poopy side, and on one side there's gold, and you have the gold. but the only way to get the gold is to pick up the poop, like that's how people are. We've got the good, we've got the bad, you get both. You can't separate them, you can't cherry pick what's good about people and refuse to accept what's bad at them. most of the time, our strengths are actually the same things as our weaknesses apply differently. So for example, I'm very bold. I will say what's on my mind, I will step up and get things done, I will just do it. I have this like bull energy and it makes amazing progress. And my brain is powerful and I'm able to think about so many different things and so I can run several different things and several different projects faster and better than the average person is. But that's the strength part of it. When I talk, my brain goes ding, ding, ding, all over the place and people who are not like ADHD cannot follow it and it annoys them and it frustrates them and stresses them out. And when somebody repeats themselves even once, like I heard you the first time, I understood you the first time, you are annoying my brain when you repeat yourself. So now I'm annoyed and that's frustrating them because they're like, well, I need to process things this way. And so to them, it's a perceived weakness. Also, the strength of my energy, some people find incredibly intimidating when it's directed at them, even though it's not directed at them, right? It's just the conversation that we're having. So they hate it when it's pointed at them, but they love it when it's pointed at anybody else on their behalf. But they want to make me wrong for when it's pointed at them. And I'm right and wonderful when it's pointed at anybody else for them. Now, I'm not being any different. I'm being me the same all the time. they're deciding if it's right or wrong or good or bad and they don't get to. Does that make sense? So, you know, Mike, his nonchalance is what makes him so good at distributions because he doesn't care. He does, he does the job, he does it well, but he doesn't care what people think about it. That is exactly the same reason he can roll in late and take long lunches because either you're going to take it or leave it, but I'm going to do what I'm going to do. They are exactly the same qualities. One has a positive effect that we really enjoy. One could be considered non-professional and annoying, but you don't get to pick and choose how it shows up or you do, but if you get rid of him because you don't like how it shows up in his time behavior. here, then you lose the power of how it shows up in this conversation with clients. You pick up under the sticks, you either take the stick or you don't, but you get both sides.
00:29:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.

So we need to know what's on the stick. And we need to know what it's doing every day. And we need to know, so let's say I don't know, like, what are the things that everyone's good at? is there something if we do some time tracking, and we say, this person and this person both have, you know, similar tasks to do, but this person does this type of task super fast, like we're looking at it and they spend two hours a week doing it.
00:29:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
this person spends 10 hours a week doing it. Not me. I mean, I remember last year when we discussed it, I initially was kind of on board with it, and I presented it to the team. Usually the team is like, you know, whoever Lauren says, we'll do it, know, they're pretty well liked.
00:30:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
likes this task.
00:30:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
But this was like unanimously rejected, all hated it.
00:30:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I think it's because of fear because nobody wants the microscope on them. That is the thing that most people, when I get into teams, they're afraid of it. They're afraid of being inspected closely. But if we can help them understand, it isn't about them and it isn't about looking for flaws. It's about looking for levers, opportunities to find the sunspots and what's different.
00:30:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
it's in take.
00:30:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:30:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I believe my audible, but I might have read it like a few years ago.
00:31:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do. I would like you to read it. So there's one story where there, I don't remember where it was. I feel like it was an Asian, like an impoverished Asian population, where basically everybody was suffering from malnourishment. And but they found this one area, this one village, where the children were thriving. And they're like, and so, okay, so this, this group of people, I'm probably gonna butcher this because it has been like 10 years since I've read the book. But they were tasked with going to helping improve nutrition for an area. They had like six months and almost no money basically. They had like no way to overhaul nutrition because there was not enough money and not enough time. But when they did, down there and they dumped at the Legos basically and they looked at everything and they like what is different. So every single population they were malnourished the children were skinny they were sick they were weak except for this one village and the difference was that the mothers so they while they were working and they started adding the shrimp into the rice and that extra protein and nourishment completely changed the way that they they were they were healthy they were strong they were thriving so that was available to all of the rest of the communities they didn't have to re-educate them they didn't have to get a program going they didn't have to bring new food in they didn't have to change changed the food chain supply at all. It already existed. They just needed to change the way that they behaved, which is utilizing a resource that was already existing and adding it to their meals.
00:33:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, you know, I'm a, you know, my background, I did a psychology in college, but not like, my whole thing was numbers and statistics.
00:33:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
loved it.
00:33:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, yeah. So, I understand the value of the proposition, but I'm wondering if there's an alternative way to get the same results with that.
00:33:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's what I'm going to tell you. I don't. I'm not a fan of interrupting, but I'm going to because this is the leadership job. Sometimes you need to convince people that they need to do the hard thing. Your job is to motivate the troops and say, we need this data. so that you can enjoy your job better. There is something here, like go read that book, go get the study, go see if you can find a parallel study so that you have enough ammunition to explain to them. I have no interest in micromanaging you. I have no interest in picking apart how you're spending your time other than going, is there a way we can build a better mouse trap? How can I help you, like what are the things that you could, do I need to train you better? Maybe I can take something off your plate and shift it to somebody else who enjoys it more and does really well and give you more of what you like. I don't know, but until we break everything down and take inventory, we don't actually know exactly what we're working with. And I want you to care enough about your career. And I want you to have enough trust in me as a leader to say that if we gather this data together, we can look getting go huh what we're doing the best we can okay great job but I've never gone through this exercise with any company over 22 years in any industry where we didn't go whoa I didn't know that what if and then we make a slight alteration and there's improvement but what is requisite first is a willingness to get the information now either these are people who are willing to be a little bit vulnerable and invest in tracking this time or they're not but so let me give you one more motivator that you may not want to use but you can and you should you're spending extra time once a week meeting with me trying to figure out how you can be better for them you take out out of your own pocket your incentive pay to give to the team. You're investing in leadership and improvement. The least that they could do is track their time for two weeks. Because you want to know, look, are you here to collect a paycheck or are you here to be part of a team and be the best part of the team that you could be? If you're here to collect a paycheck, you're probably not going to last a long time. Because you're going to be at this for a couple more decades probably before you retire, right?
00:36:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh yeah, the fire retire.
00:36:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Right. This world is not getting cheaper. So don't you think you have the best odds of being successful at it and being like minimizing stress and actually enjoying your life and enjoying your job if you're surrounded by people who are invested and being the best that they can be like you are?
00:36:56 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I feel like I am right now. I think all four of them are pretty invested in what they're doing, which is why I appreciate them so much.
00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Two weeks of time tracking, like what's their biggest issue?
00:37:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
know this is like, I know you're probably going to say no, but Can I just ask them, okay, you don't need to give me your exact times, but you need to give me a percentage for each task, the percentage of the total time for that day for each task.
00:37:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me tell you why that doesn't work. They will guess if they're not writing down the times.
00:37:45 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, in other words, they would write down the time, but not having to share with me the exacts.
00:37:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Why? Okay, are they not getting paid hourly? Yeah, okay. Is there any reason why it's unreasonable to be held accountable for where your time goes when you're getting paid hourly. But the motive, that's the thing. That's your job as a leader to help them to believe and understand. you could tell them, look, I'm, if I wanted to be a jerk about it, my rights to say, look, you're paid hourly. This, this is, you know, a time report. Um, you know, I say do it, do it. But that's not why we're doing it. This is short term. This isn't going to be something that keeps coming up. It's not about micromanaging because it's not necessary. Micromanaging is counterproductive because you want autonomous people who are going to problem solves themselves. you need to tell them that also. Okay. But what this is, is a leadership effort on your part to figure out what. the pieces are and is there any kind of, okay, so for example, vieri came from a place where the tasks were segmented? Is the way that we're doing it better? How do we know? Let's take a look at what's happening and how it's going and how everybody on the team is performing and just see if we can do something like, do you guys not care enough to be willing just for two weeks, track your time? You can track your time too and you can report it and you can say, hey, I'll report to you, I don't have to, but I'm going to. Lead by example, if you want to, there's all kinds of ways to go about it, but at the end of the day, the more information that we have, the better we can lead and support and encourage and ask them to, like, are you going to be here for a year? Are you going to be here five years, 10 years, 15, 20 years? Do you want to be in an environment that is optimized for you to be able to spend your time doing the things that you enjoy the most or that you're the best at? and being surrounded by people who are being able to. I don't know, like do you wanna, how much joy do you wanna have out of it? Do you wanna come in and just drudge through it? Because what we're doing today, we don't get to keep doing. Like if you're not, we're always moving, we're either moving forward or moving backwards. There is no static, there is no being stagnant. And the market keeps changing. And there will be somebody better coming up. Like if you want to create the environment where you don't have to keep going and looking for another job and new people to work with, then we have to make the most out of what we have here. But in order to do that, we need to analyze it. And we need to not be afraid of analyzing it, which means they need to trust you that you're not there to pick things apart and break it, but you're there to look at it and go, how can we make it better? how can I support you? And either they believe you or they do. don't and either they're willing to do the extra work or they're not. They can grab about it. They don't have to love it. Nobody has to love it. And I would encourage that you don't grab about it because that doesn't support anything and that's negative and it perpetuates negative energy. You can complain once. can say, I don't like it once, once. Other than that, you become a complainer and that's an issue and the culture should be, because we talked about culture last week, we're not here to be a complainer. We're here to make the best out if we can. So that's it. It's a long conversation sometimes. It's a short conversation, but it's your job as a leader to try it now. Now, you don't believe in it, sorry my dogs are going nuts, then that's a whole other issue. So let's start there. Do you think that there's value in understanding how long it takes people to do tasks and how long they spend on it and seeing if there's any kind of patterns that evolve? okay data is my safety blanket right you like you just said like that's what you were looking at was numbers so this should make perfect sense to you so i need you to dig deep and explain to them why you love numbers and to me this is what i tell people all the time numbers tell the truth numbers don't have emotions right so if i go and i look and and very takes um 10 hours a week or 15 hours a week for for just collecting medical records and she's only getting five cases and i don't remember the other person who's equivalent on your team i have to go look at the numbers the spreadsheet hold on mike that would be mike right well they don't work out that way or maybe they did anyway it's not a perfect analog because it's a little bit differently on the other team but right so but anyway comparing what you can and going you know this takes you a lot longer but but for example it's Is there anything that Mike can do to help Viri or I don't know who else would would be doing distributions but can Mike teach anybody any that or is that just his innate qualities and it's not teachable there's probably a tactic that he could share right now and I'm all for cross training um do you have any problem with me saying telling them you know this time keep this time keeping data is just between you me and Tina not a thing not at all and you can tell them my origin how we came to work together um the impact that it had on you last year that mark has been hiring me for over three years now um that he has done this work he's done the time tracking and the time reporting so um you know uh Yeah, I think that that is helpful and to know that, you know, some of the surveys that they've seen in Sweet Law, some of the things that have your team is newer, but that we're constantly looking for supporting and making the best place for the existing people, rather than going, who can we fire? Who can we get rid of? There's never that energy here.
00:44:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I can sell it better like that because it, you know, it doesn't matter how nice Mark and Mary are. There's that upper management where they feel like they have to be a little bit more guarded.
00:44:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you can tell them, Mark's done going to see it, Mark doesn't want to see it. He doesn't even know I'm asking before it. Like that's the autonomy that I have and the autonomy that you have, which in and of itself is part of the culture autonomy and you're not trying to undo it and you wouldn't because micromanagement is a nightmare. It is a just stress cesspool. It's not good for anybody. It feels terrible. This is just data. This is just data. It's data that scares them and you get that because it feels like a microscope. But the intent of the microscope is to go, what can we make better for you, not what's wrong with you?
00:45:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. Yeah, I think I can sell that.
00:45:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The framing is everything and maybe you can tie a reward into it saying like the more accurate the data is after two weeks, like this is what I'm willing to put into it. Maybe you give them, I don't know if it's a financial incentive or maybe just, I don't know. I don't know how to do that. I don't know what motivates your people. But if you could then by sending it incentivize them, or just even show thanks, you know, whatever you have to do, but I can tell you that data is super helpful. There's always an aha moment where we can go, oh, this might be how we can support them better. For example, so one of the surveys that we did was Sweet Law. Black Swan, Black Swan, you know who Black Swan is, right? Yeah. Okay. That came as a result of a survey. That came as a result of me saying, how can we help your people more? Where are they struggling? And one of the answers was converting leads to cases. So it wasn't just intake, but it was also, you know, the attorney team. And it was primarily intake being better at sales, but it also can happen from, you know, getting fired up of cases. And there's this whole persuasion tactic. So But it was a long time going through, just trying to get people to read the book from Black Swan first, and then trying to get the appointment and get the training, like you don't know how many times, every single week, I'm like, where are you at with Black Swan? Well, blah blah blah. Like it just took so long, but as a result of it, Samantha, for example, just reading the book automatically improved, she took some concept from it. She had an aha moment, and from that point forward, applied it and improved her numbers rapidly. I wish I could remember what it was, but I don't know what the tactic was because I didn't read the book anyway. But that's my point, is that we didn't know until we did the survey and asked questions, and somebody was willing to be honest and say, I could be better at sales, and so we got that. And you can share that. There was another, the intake also, at least one person, but I think that there were a couple of people that said, I don't know how to talk to people whose child died or whose spouse died in an accident. Like, this is really difficult. And so we got the grief counselor to come in and talk to them. Did you know that?
00:48:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, but I wish I would have been there because that's like one of the things that I struggle with too was when I because in Arizona, the attorney has to talk to the to the client before they sign. And usually, like, I get a little nervous every time I have to talk to a debt, wrongful death case.
00:48:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, we could, I could get Mark to bring them back in. And also, there are people who didn't get that. So because they're new since then.
00:48:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You know, I do OK. Like, I don't like avoid it if I'm the only one available.
00:48:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But do you want to do OK? do you want to get some extra skills that can help you be even better at it?
00:49:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'm always for extra skills.
00:49:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, and that's the thing I want you to take from this is that these things are happening in Sweet Law, but it starts with asking questions, it starts with honest vulnerable answers, then it goes with taking action and trying to improve that situation, but none of it did anybody get, you know, laser pointed, hey, you're coming out of here. It has all been beneficial to the members of Sweet Law.
00:49:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, with the month I'm having right now, I don't know. Oh, we're having a pretty crappy month right now, so.
00:49:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, we've got a little bit more time. What is there anything that you feel like you have control over that you can improve that?
00:49:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
There's sticks in the fire, and I know they're going to come, but right now, I mean, it's bad. It's like my worst month so far.
00:50:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So we've been digging into your team. I would like to spend some time working with you and working with your processes. I'm sure that we can do something to improve it. But you are, your team is you. Like these are your resources. So I need you to be successful at persuading them. We need this information. I need to know what your resources are and you need to know what your resources are. Because being able to lean on mic for distributions had to have been really eating to you.
00:50:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, yeah, extremely.
00:50:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So is there other relief that can come for you and for others that we don't know about because we haven't fully inspected. So here's the thing is if Lorenz's pod goes down, guess what happens Like, if you don't hit your numbers and you don't have a job, guess what happens to everybody else?
00:51:05 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
They don't have job.
00:51:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, so help me help you, right? Jerry Maguire, then. Tell me the money. Tell me the money. So, look, and we're at the beginning of this, and I need you to just take a deep breath and be like, I am on the path of growth, and I'm willing to do the work. Now, if you see that you could hustle your way to something different, if you could see where you can make some improvements, what, so other than what we've already talked about, I want you to do that. want you to get your team on board with time tracking for two weeks, incentivize them, however you can, but you can be vulnerable to and say, like, this is the worst month I've ever had since I've been here. If I'm out, you're out. And this is not your fault. So, I'm trying to figure out how do I make everybody be as great as possible. possible so that we not only just have jobs but we have jobs we'd like that we want to stay with working with people we like um that's your job that's what you need to do you need to lead them you need to make them trust you because you are trustworthy anyway and you are safe and do that and then I need you to start digging into your processes I need you to track your time Lorenz that would be very helpful to me um I may need to ask Mark about that and say hey can you help me look at this you'll be safe with him just just your time and but I'm asking you at a time if you're okay with that um if you track your time for two weeks and say hey what do you notice about this could you make it better he likes you he knows that you are reliable he you you are wanted you are wanted so he wants you to be good you want to be good the business needs to be good. You'll get paid more if you do better. I need you to trust that you're safe with him as very as with you because you are.
00:53:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, he's pretty inscrutable when that comes to me.
00:53:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I get a different perspective and I need you to be able to trust me. I know both sides. I've seen glimpses of it and but I know the game. I know the locker room talk and I know the person and you're as safe with him as very as with you. So but I want you to buckle down. want you to roll up your sleeves. I want you to be vulnerable and I want you to get the work. So start tracking your time very closely. Let me analyze it first. If I can find an not on my own. We can just keep it between us. So that will mean that I need you to be super informative about all these things. So when you track your time, I want you to explain it to me too, because I don't know all the lingo. I don't know all the operations. I don't know a lot, I don't know all of it. So I want you to be really thorough and explain this is this, this is this, this is why this is important. This is what's hard about this. This is what this means to the value of the case. Like, I want you to analyze it as much as you can before you even give it to me.
00:54:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So you don't want just the Y as well?
00:54:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The Y, the how, the way you prioritize it, what logic you use to prioritize it. I want to understand everything I possibly can understand about it. Because the way my brain works, I should be able to help. And if I can't and we need to get It's what I need insight from market that we can, but the more information you give me, the less likely I'm going to ask or need to ask anything because Lorenz, this is what I do most is optimized. So that data is really important to me. So if you can do a good job of tracking it accurately, timestamps as often as possible, and then really explain it, I can just about guarantee you I can find something to improve you. But now I want to go back and just give you one more reminder that we had one conversation you thought differently about how to make leaders around you and you up to numbers immediately that very next month. So we are going through and we're looking for leverage and we're having way more than one conversation and I don't ever fail because when people will do the work and we get the data, there's always a very simple path to improvement even if it's small and then what happens is those small improvements start to compound. So there's really not anything to be afraid of because statistically I don't feel and the people I work with don't fail if they show up and they get the data and they do the work. It hasn't happened yet. Not saying it can't. I'm just saying that there's always a place to improve a little bit and that little bit of improvement having the compounding effect and now you're multiplying it times everybody else having a little bit of improvement and now your whole team is improving month after month, after year, like that's powerful. Those numbers start to become very obviously much better but what happens in addition to it and this is my favorite part is there's less stress while it's happening because now people understand the mechanics where they weren't even considering the mechanics before. They're like I still have to work and I do what I do. Instead of a stroke to work, I do what I do, but why do I do what I do and why do I do it this way and when they analyze it and then they optimize it, that's a whole new ball game. And so think about when you're driving and you're learning how to drive. There's a lot. And the first time that you get behind the wheel so imagine being a kid being like that's so easy. All you have to do is like press the gas and go room room and turn the wheel my kids every single time until they drive and then they drive it like oh my gosh it's so scary. Yeah, because you're having to make multiple calculations instantaneously on the fly they're so much going through your brain and you're having to evaluate every single thing. Is it my turn to go do I put a signal on do I break it my breaking too much. That guy's going is it my turn and like wait, wait, there's all these different things. Okay, and you're having to process them. And so in the beginning. you're having to make these calculations and they're new, so you're just asking yourself, what are the numbers that even going into the calculations? But eventually, you drive so much that they become reflexive. You automatically know, like, imagine what it was like when you were learning your times tables. At first, you have to sit there and like, it all down and figure it out and find some way to do it. And then you memorize it. And then you know, 4 times 4 is 16. 6 times 6 is 36. Like, you just know what they are. So you don't have to spend time on it, which means it's less stressful because it's reflexive now. Driving is no longer stressful because it's reflexive now. Math is not basic, right? There's a lot of things that become less stressful because they're reflexive because what you did was stop having to make the calculations. So But if you can create the system that removes the need to make the calculations and the calculations are needed because I'm stressed out and how do I figure out how to get through these things when the phone starts ringing all day? Well, I need to come in two hours early, but now I have to go take my two kids who are not even in school yet and get daycare. So I'm going to disrupt their time and it's going to be early and I'm going to spend extra money just so I can do the job that should be able to be contained in the work hours.
00:59:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Right.
00:59:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. That's stressful. What if we could get enough information and the only thing that came out of it is Viri is meeting her goals and now she doesn't have to go disrupt the lives of her young children by getting a daycare provider and now somebody, does she trust them? Are they safe? Are they happy? Do they feel loved? Is she stressed out the rest of the time? I'm now because she's leaving her little kids and they're only going to be little for a few more years before they start school. Like, that's a big deal in a person's life. But with a little bit more information, we might be able to figure out how to optimize what we're doing so that her children aren't so that her performance is still good throughout the day because she's not depressed that she had to lead them two hours earlier just to get the job done. Because we're not segmented and segregated here like in other businesses and maybe I should just go back to another firm where at least I only have one type of task and I didn't have to leave my kids. Like, people don't think about all these things in their teammates. Sometimes the bosses aren't thinking about them, but your people are thinking about them and sometimes they just make a decision and then they up and lead. So you need to think about it all proactively. And in order to be able to think about it well, you need eat data and information. So you can use that as an example. If you talk to Viri first and say, can I use this as an example? And maybe you don't use her specifically, maybe find a way around it and draw a similar kind of story that doesn't draw too much attention to her. But at the end of the day, greatness is always hard work. Average is, it's not fun, it's stressful. The average job is people don't want to go. They go because they have to. Because they have to pay bills. That's the average workplace. Showing out to a place that you like to work, even if it's remote and existing with an organization that you like and that you feel safe with, that's not average, that's above average. That's great. But to keep, to get even better, like it takes more or effort. So you have to decide what you want and then you have to decide who you want with you and then you have to decide if you can motivate them to be great with you because it would be so much more enjoyable than just being worried about your job every day or every week or every month.
01:02:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. I'll start trying my time tomorrow then.
01:02:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right.
01:02:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Hopefully I can be, you know, can have like first-hand experience and then I'll be able to sell them all that even stronger.
01:02:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that and we can wait so that you have some example and then you know if you want to wait a couple weeks before you ask them, track your time.
01:02:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
and I could only make sense for me to jump into the frame, know, before them.
01:02:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. I love that. I love leading by example. And then if we find something, a nugget that we can work on to improve for you, you can say, look, this was my experience. I did it, and I know exactly what I can do to make some improvements, and I feel better about it. I feel more peaceful about it. I feel clearer about it. that's everything. You know, you testify yourself, I know that this is going to be good for us, and I'm only looking for the good.
01:03:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
01:03:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. You can do this. And the goal, the goal is that it's to, it's to feel great, it's to enjoy the people that you're working with, the work that you're doing. We're not going to enjoy all of it. There's going to be stuff that sucks. That's just life. But you can create packets of just, wow, that's great. These people are great. This is awesome. And it's okay that I have to do this. for the next 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 years, whatever it is.
01:04:04 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, yeah, I want them to know what it's like to feel like you're working every day for someone else's dream. I want to feel like they're working towards their own dreams to they're invested in them.
01:04:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, the growth of business as much as they are on their own. Yes. And that's a good thing to also what we didn't get to what I would love for you to do is send me what everybody's goals where you said you wanted goals for each of the people about time. my job was waiting for me to take her shopping so she can get ready for girls camp. I'm fine. I'm excited about that. But please send me that just so I have it. And any other notes that you might have just clip notes on how those meetings went. And then so next week, I'm meeting just with Patrick. And then the week after that, we'll have our group meeting and then the week after that is our one on one. So we'll figure it out. out. But if you send that to me an email, then maybe we can just kind of work this in the background. But the very least, that gives you those two weeks to be tracking your time. And I want you to analyze it. want you to look at it and go, huh, maybe, you know, just see if you noticed any kind of patterns.
01:05:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Sure. Yeah.
01:05:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Thanks, Tina. You're awesome. Thank you for your time, Lawrence. I hope you have a great week.

Hi, Tina. Hi, how are you?
00:00:03 - Laura L
Oh, good yourself.
00:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good, except for I can't find. I don't remember the name of the high level account that I had because under my friend's domain, I think I shared it with you.
00:00:20 - Laura L
Yeah, you did. Let me shut its name. Okay. Okay.
00:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yes, thank you. That's how little I've been in it. I really wanted to be prepared and have things organized for you, but this is the thing. I'm starting to get to a point where, oh, I could stop my video. Sorry. uh where I can't do things by myself so much so I'm a business consultant and what I do for to earn my money for the most part is um I get on meetings with clients who pay me really well and I help them with their systems and their teams and their operations and their mindset and all kinds of things I take a really holistic approach to business so um I've been doing that for 22 years but um and everything I've done has been 100% word of mouth and I get paid really really well and it's been amazing and it's been a blessing um and I've been raising four children by myself for that same amount of time but now I in this background is relevant so that you understand just kind of like um a little bit about me and understand where um you know what you could offer what how you might be helpful and because I would really like, I think there's a potential for a great long term arrangement. But I think that it's helpful to understand the background. So two of my daughters are fully grown now and I've got a 17 year old and a 14 year old. And so I needed a lot less and the reason I chose the work that I did and the reason I got good at what I got good at was because I needed work to be very efficient. I needed business to be very efficient so that I had plenty of time to be mom. And because I got good at that, I was able to train it to other people and that's what they came you up for. But I only worked about 10 hours a week. And I mean, that's how good of a business it is that even in 10 hours a week, I could still take really good care of my family. So I'm good at what I do. But I need to work more because I'm a mama at heart. and without little kids at home to take care of, I really want to put it into business right now. And so I want to help more people, but because my business has always been 100% word of mouth, I can't just grow it. I don't have a marketing engine for it at all. I've never run ads for it, I've never needed to. And I've never had, I've never launched a course, but I really felt called because my approach is so different. You know, I'm not about the hustle and grind. I'm not about, you know, make as much money as you can, just because you can. It's really about using business to help you have a full fulfilling and happy life. And that looks different for everybody. Everybody's brains are different. Everybody's skills are different. Their finances are different. Their family time is different. You know what I mean? All these different things. And so I'm able to teach people. how to build there and optimize their business based on their own values and their own resources and things like that. So there's a couple things going on. One of the things is I'm working on building that course. I'm having somebody help kind of extract information for me. I'm using AI to help me just organize and take all of the stuff that I've been doing on repeat for 22 years. And productizing it so that I can offer it to people who can't afford $500 to $1,000 an hour to work with me. So that's part of it. And then the other thing is though I would like to also build a system that can help me find the higher level clients that I have and they are going to be know multi seven figure earners. I've got doctors, I've got lawyers, I've got market I've got copywriters, I've got, I've had property managers, I have lots of different types of people. So working on all of that and inside of that, because I've been working on building businesses with other people, and also because when I first got started, it wasn't as a consultant, it was, I did web design, I did graphic design, I did copywriting, I customized WordPress, I customized PHP scripts, I built automations, so I have a lot of the, I know that there's a lot of great things that we can do just to kind of build a really good engine and machine using technology, and I want to leverage all of that. But I don't want to be the one doing the work and thinking about that, I want to stay in my own lane of helping the business people do their job well. So when you said automations make your brain light up, That's awesome. That's so fun. And maybe it'll be something where you'll look at things and go, oh, I see we're doing it this way, you know, have you thought about doing this or incorporating that? And not necessarily immediately, but just thinking about what I would love is if I give you a task, if you have a thought about it, like I think, you know, have you thought about doing it that way, right? I think maybe this would be better or this is a potential problem I see.
00:06:35 - Laura L
Like I would really love to hear from you. Okay, I'm sort of a collaboration.
00:06:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I would really love that. That would be the most useful thing to me. I'm not afraid of making mistakes. I'm not afraid of wasting time. I'm not afraid of wasting money. The only thing I don't want to do is be stuck doing it by myself because then I'll just be like, I'm not going to get it done because I'm I am social, and I work socially, and I don't want to disappoint somebody working for me. if I tell you I'm going to do something, then I'm going to do it. If I can, you what I mean? So that really helps me be able to get my stuff done. So to begin with, I thought that maybe I could just kind of screen share and like walk you through some of my assets and show you what's existing and kind of tell you the framework of where I want to get started so that we can get some traction because I think if I build the house, then it will be easy for me to put the furniture in so to speak. create a membership area with the sections and then I'm like, okay great, here's the content for that section, that type of thing.
00:07:52 - Laura L
Make sense?
00:07:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. cool. So let me go ahead and screen share. I'm just like super
00:08:00 - Laura L
dehydrated all the sun. Is it sunny there?
00:08:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, well, no, be kind of the sun is going down. It'll be down in about 45 minutes.
00:08:12 - Laura L
I see. Well, it's really hard hearing the Philippines.
00:08:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's not fun.
00:08:18 - Laura L
Yeah.
00:08:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Talking to me, think about where they're at. I have a couple of these that are working for me in my Etsy shop. And let's see. Lee is in. I don't know where she's at. It's 11 a.m.
00:08:38 - Laura L
time. Yeah, I think we're at the same time.
00:08:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is all of the Philippines in the same time? Yeah. I mean, oh, I'm going to stop sharing just for a second. Well, it doesn't really matter. This is my ADHD brain. I go all over the place and but eventually we may all be in the Slack channel working together.
00:09:12 - Laura L
Hello.
00:09:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And okay, so I've got, well, that was what I was not showing. Profitriders Inc is my main website. I don't do anything with it. Like I said, everything is word of mouth. The only reason it exists, what is this? Is because sometimes people look me up and I just wanted to have a place where they could find some things that they look me up because I do do some podcasts, interviews with other people on their podcast. And I have had, this is terrible, this is terrible. I have had people 26 years business that's not well actually it's 28 yeah because I had six years in corporate. So that needs to be updated somebody else built this website for me so and it currently is hosted on Presidium have you heard of Presidium oh not yet okay so it's just a WordPress hosting service that is pretty quick um is it a page builder no well no it's not they but they do have it's just WordPress hosting so well actually let me go I don't want to go to the dashboard I want to go to Presidium.com as reliable secure managed work press hosting so
00:11:00 - Laura L
Okay.
00:11:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They do have great support and I do want to share that with you. So let me actually do this. Is that right? No, that's not what I want to do. I have, there's things that you can't see because it's not being shared but it's the zoom controls and they keep getting in the way. So, okay, share securely. Open. And I. Okay, so we'll share a procedure. So then you will have access to all of my current hosting. I don't Is that everything in there? All the sites. Okay, so these are the domains that I have that are hosted here. I'm not really using that. I do have something on. Hey, it's Tina Marie because I try lots of different things. I'm just going to show you. I really am all over the place. Oh, and what I did have is an existing anymore. So that's fun. I don't know how that happened. I had it. So that's something. If you, we could use either like a shared Google Doc or something. I don't know if you like project management suites, how you like to organize tasks that need to get done. I can use any of them, you know, Trello teamwork, we can use a Google Doc, we can, I prefer not email, Slack has a new thing where you can manage a project in there.
00:13:14 - Laura L
But, yeah.
00:13:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What would you, what would you prefer for getting assignments and keeping track of them? Do you have any preference?
00:13:22 - Laura L
Yeah, right now I'm using Trello, but it would be convenient for you to use like them.
00:13:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I could also do that. Okay, I do like Slack Trello is totally okay too, especially with the Canban boards where we can move things into in progress. Do you have something that you could share, or would you like me to set up an account and share it with you?
00:13:48 - Laura L
Yeah, I can do a set up the one so it would be easier, I mean convenient for you.
00:13:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, that would be great.
00:13:58 - Laura L
Maybe.
00:14:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We could just have boards like to do and then progress road block and completed something like that. That would be perfect.
00:14:09 - Laura L
Okay.
00:14:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
um, let's start with this. Okay. So profit drivers right now is hosted here. Now, I, I am going to use high level, but it's not great as a host. It's great for texting and automations, but not for hosting, but I am considering. So one of the things that I get blocked on a lot, Laura is where to host a membership site. I have a bad habit of overthinking things and wanting it to be really perfect in terms of a user experience. The biggest thing is what I would like to be able to do is. serve content that a person does not have to log in to see. So like if we send an email and say, hey, module one is ready for you, if they click that link, I would love it to automatically log them in. They don't have to put in a username and password, and they can just go see their content because every step where there's a roadblock of any sort reduces the likelihood that they're going to consume the content. And I want like everything about what I do is to create and make things as simple as possible for people so that they can get the most important things done. Are you familiar with anything that, because I think you can do that with entrepreneurs, but I'm not going to pay for entrepreneurs because that's it's crazy expensive, but are you familiar with any other platform or even if high level, if you. can if we can create links that automatically log people in so that if I email them a link, they can go straight to their content without logging in.
00:16:11 - Laura L
I could actually check because I'm not really that 100% sure yet for a high level, but other than that I tried cartra, but it would be also the same with on-chip port. It's pretty expensive. So yeah, I could go ahead and look at go high level if there's that dynamic URL that they would take you to the content right away.
00:16:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and I would love because the one thing I know about high level is first of all, they have like Frankenstein code. They purchased their code from all kinds of different sources and kind of pieced it together, but they keep working on it and they keep evolving it and they evolve it quickly. And so if we put that in as a feature request, that might be something that it could actually provide. very quickly. So I would love it if you would take it obviously billable time and see and talk to their support and find out if that's something that's an option. And if not then finding out like there's searchy.io there's circle there's all these other platforms that are just content based sorry my dog is just barking her head off. And we could put it anywhere. I do want it to be simple. The biggest thing I think is that I want it to be simple access. So there's also school. I'm not a fan of it but but I really need to get over myself. So one of the things that would be super amazing for me from you and I shouldn't need it because I'm 47 years old and I should know better. But I need encouragement. I just need to hear this is going to be okay. We'll make it work. People will like it. it, that type of thing. It's, it seems like a really silly thing. But honestly, I can almost cry right now. Like, that's just, that's ridiculous. But that's, that's what my roadblock is. There's nobody that does that in my business. I do that for people all day long. So if that was something you felt comfortable doing with, that would be amazing to me. And you would be invaluable. So they're sad. Great tip. Yeah, yeah. and one of the things about just hiring you is that I, when I looked at your, your reviews and the feedback that people left you and I saw how long you, you worked, I feel like your person that enjoys being a part of a team and enjoys the work that you do and is very supportive. So, but also you, you are smart. You articulate. You really take a lot of boxes. So I, I'm really looking forward to this and I would just want to encourage you to just use this place with me to explore things maybe that you don't feel like you get to with other people because one of my favorite things is to see people grow their most like I don't have ego it's not a hey you work for me lady kind of thing it's not like that you know I might pay the bill but you do something for me that I can't or won't do for myself so I have tremendous value for you already and if there's a way that I can be supportive to you in your growth or even just allowing you to experiment with things let me know because I love I love being able to offer that to people well honestly I really love this kind of opportunity the first I met you when you shared your story because I actually planning to then sort out like a
00:20:00 - Laura L
the aid services here in the Philippines, the people here like my colleagues are struggling, finding jobs as they want to experience the same thing as my experience, like working from home and not missing out the milestone of my kids. So I'm kind of wanted to make this work out so I could also help them. I want to share the blessing of, you know, having the opportunity to take care of the kids at the same time earning.
00:20:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yes. Yes, I would be happy to help you in any way with that. Helping grow and start businesses is my area of expertise. cheapest client pays me $500 an hour to do it. So I'm good at it and I, but I do it for free. I sometimes just donate services. and help people because I really do love what I do and I feel like it's my calling. So if like sometimes if we just want to have a call about what you're doing and just work on that, I'll just give that to you.
00:21:14 - Laura L
Well, I'm still struggling though of finding my calling yet, but yeah, I'm actually trying to taking the time to really find it.
00:21:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah, it is. I feel like, especially as a mom, it took me a really long time to be clear about things and be clear about what is and what is not for me. And a lot of times what became clearer first was what is not for me. So it was easier for me to find what is for me by finding out what wasn't. Because there's so many things that can be, you know what I mean, but by finding out the things that they're not for me either because they aren't compatible with me. my values or with my faith and or with being a mom. I'm not compatible with the schedule or like a lot of the reasons I don't do marketing is because so many women, they use their bodies and they draw attention in a way that I never wanted to do. And it's not about judging them, it's just it's not what I wanted to do. And so that was what I was like, okay, that's not for me. So, you know, it was it was a lot of that. But what I found is that every time I would get excited and want to do something, it would be like, God is like, okay, you get to do that, but not yet. Right now, I need you to take care of babies and I need you to be available for them and just be patient and your time will come, but you want it to be mom. So, you know, there's this. And so it's been really fascinating to go through that. I've been a mom for 23 years. And now I am almost almost like all my babies my my baby is going to be 15 in November.
00:23:05 - Laura L
So she's almost young. is 15.
00:23:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She'll be 15 in November.
00:23:10 - Laura L
She's 14 right now. Okay. Well, that's so fast, right?
00:23:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yeah, they are all growing up. And I'm a grandmother.
00:23:22 - Laura L
I'm about to have my second grandbaby.
00:23:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
00:23:25 - Laura L
Yeah. So this is what? 23. Oh, wow. So you already have two grandchildren.
00:23:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, she's 20. She'll be 24 in December. And she's not even the one that's a mom. It's the the one under her who's 22.
00:23:42 - Laura L
I see. Yeah. Well, I also get pregnant when I was 24 and my eldest is now 11. It's like a 10 year gap between my eldest and my baby now, which is one year old.
00:23:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, wow. That's awesome. I have there's a nine year gap between my oldest and my youngest. my youngest was born in 2000 when I was 24 and my one of my oldest and then my youngest was born in 2009. So they're nine years apart, but then there's two little ones in between. How fun. Okay, so the first assignment then is to set up the Trello account for us. Okay, the second assignment would be to find out if we can get a login less, basically access to membership content where somebody can just click in the email and access their content without having to click a login to any thing. Okay, so that's the second one and then after that it would be to To take a look at this site and see if there's anything that you notice needs fixing like that formatting is terrible, terrible, terrible. I hate my pictures, but people want to see faces, whatever. don't Want any branding guide. I don't. I've never done that. And if, but I do clearly obviously have colors. I really don't care about them, but I have them. That's the blue, the green and the orange, this, this blue. This is a dark blue in here. It's not black. It's actually a navy in the orange. So there's these four colors. I do have it in Canva. I do have my fonts there. So I kind of do. Let me show you my canvas. I think I also have a slot for another team number. don't know if that's even relevant, but. um profit drivers and wait our out brand kits that's it yeah so my logo's in there um the i don't know what this maybe the color that you have in the website but well it was something i was thinking about after 2020 that's a look at that okay anyway so um yeah logos uh let's see fonts title i think that's right um one test rod i'm not sure actually what this font is i thought it was railway i'm not sure what it is um but i don't really use it anywhere else and um do with this open sand cutting, yeah, I'm not sure I could find that. If it's needed for anything, the other thing is I do actually have a what do you call it. icon a favicon, but this is not using the right one and I don't know if it's in here, but I do have that so I would like it to be using the correct favicon. And so that could be a task as well, and then making sure that these forms work. So another thing that I would want to share with you is get response because that is the CRM basically that I have the email service provider to. And. Where's my code in here. If I can find it. I have nothing getting codes, wait where did it go, did it go to my email, so it to my email. I have a brain, it's just sleepy. Okay, there we go. didn't even need to do to share this with you, but I should do that. Share with Laura.
00:28:38 - Laura L
Hello real. Yeah, that's.
00:28:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, um, I don't know which one it is actually connected to. It might be 10 ways to 10k. Yeah. I drive no traffic to it, but it still gets traffic. One of the things I would like to have is Google Analytics, working, GA4, are you familiar with it? Yes. Great. Because I was having problems getting it integrated, I may have it, I may not, so another thing would be analytics.google.com. If I could add you here, would it be the same email address?
00:29:44 - Laura L
Yeah.
00:29:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So. I've got drivers. Um, I've never been very good at navigating this. Like, I don't know where to go to add you. So I would like to add you to everything that I have, but you could, I probably set up other properties and if you get stuck somewhere and just tell me, look, I need you to add me to something.
00:30:11 - Laura L
Yeah, I think it's an admin setting. At the bottom where there's a. Yes.
00:30:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. Set up these. Count details and access management.
00:30:26 - Laura L
Yep.
00:30:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Add users. Oh, Laura.
00:30:33 - Laura L
Laura. Yep, two, five, eight. That's you know, yeah. I think you also have to add the role.
00:30:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I'll just add you as administrators, but you can just have full. Okay. And then that. So. So then another assignment is just to check to see that GA4 is installed, it's collecting data, set up correctly, that kind of thing. checking the forms, checking the form matting on the home page, that is weird.
00:31:21 - Laura L
Are you not using Google Tag Manager or just the analytics?
00:31:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm probably not. I 100% neglect everything in my business, other than my clients.
00:31:34 - Laura L
You can assume it's not done or not done right. Maybe we could use the Google Tag Manager because we could also put all the tracking in there and yes please.
00:31:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It all in one place? Yes. I love analytics. It's been a while since I've looked at it because basically since it went to GA4 we've all been like what the heck is going on. And I don't spend a lot of time in it. I spend most of my time doing all kinds of other things in the business, but I used to be very familiar with analytics. I would look at heat maps. I want to know the conversions. I want to know the metrics. I want to know my balance rate. want to know my speed, the page loads speed. want to know all of that because that has an impact on how long people stay on the site. I want to know what they're engaging with. I want to know what's turning them off. So analytics is really important to me, but I'm never going to be the one to do anything other than pay for somebody to do it well because I've got too many other things in my brain. And it's another reason I'm really excited for you because I feel like you're going to be super helpful.
00:32:48 - Laura L
Yeah, that's also the problem for me because I feel like I kind of have that general thing like by actions, like, yeah, say they would want this. You know, I could like do and do that stuff because I also really love learning at the same way.
00:33:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. mean, it's like the best teacher. Yes. I am the same way. I'm a nerd. And if I have a question, I'll spend five hours learning about it and become an expert.
00:33:19 - Laura L
And even if I never do it ever again.
00:33:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I don't know a lot about it.
00:33:25 - Laura L
And if you ask a question, I could teach it to you. Yeah. Yeah.
00:33:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
okay. So I feel like that is a few things to get started on that will be at least probably five hours. If you run into a block and you need more time, we can do that. It's not urgent, like, I'm never going to be like, this has to be done really quickly for the most part. But I would like to go kind of quickly to get things at least to a baseline, a membership site where I can put content. tend to. So the priority, this is one of the things we should always do on our calls to, is decide, okay, of all the things that need to get done, what's the order of priority, what first, what second, what last, and so on. That way, I know that the thing that was important, that was most important to me is getting worked on. So if something doesn't get done, it's not going to be the most important thing, and that will be really great. So the priority really for me would be to make a decision about a membership site where I can start putting content in, and then the second thing would be analytics, but you have to decide is the website, like, do you know enough? Do you need to dig into the hosting a little bit, know, make sure that certain plugins are there, whatever, like, so that's up to you in terms of what you feel like you need to do for a baseline of making sure that the site is workable for you, make your suggestions. about we should have these plugins, we should not have these plugins, whatever. Yeah, so do you feel like that's kind of a clear starting point, especially with getting the Trello would be like step one, obviously, so that I can look at it and go, okay, here's the list of tasks that you captured. Yes, that's right. Then I can drag them, you know, in order of priority, if I change my mind or something, but the top of it right now would be membership site, second would be analytics, and then the other thing was just, you know, cleaning things up and then checking the forms, making sure that they work. So that's a good starting point, you think?
00:35:44 - Laura L
Yes, it is.
00:35:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Great. Good.
00:35:47 - Laura L
I'm so excited. Ah, really? Me too, really excited to get started. And also for the members should site just to clarify that would be hosted in Go High. I level so just only the membership it could be.
00:36:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know where I'm going to host it yet. If go high level can work in a way where it's really easy for people to access and they don't have to log in then I would host it there. If not, I want to look at some other options and see if there's a way for no login access. Do you know what mean? Like there's an automatic like the the URL is pre-coded for them to log them in. So that could be the second step. If it can't be go high level, is there another option that does pre-coded that isn't a CRM like on support or cartra but is a is purposefully like a membership service like Circle or Searchy or School or any of those types of things.
00:36:52 - Laura L
So I mean how do I let this govern maybe thinkific or yes yes yes anything that will do it.
00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm happy to pay for your research time because I do it and then I get frustrated and then I start overthinking things and I go down rabbit holes and I've wasted time and then I'm frustrated that I've wasted time. So yes, if you would do that, I will pay for the research time and then if you would make your recommendation and give me the data so I can make a decision but with your help, that would be amazing and then we'll just make a decision and then go with the best thing that we can that's also cost-effective.
00:37:36 - Laura L
Okay, yep, we'll do.
00:37:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, do you have other questions?
00:37:41 - Laura L
Yeah, I'll do it now.
00:37:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yay, I'm so like I feel relieved, I feel excited and also I love that you want to build something. know that that'll take a little while to do but if you wanted to like right out what you envision and then what I really start with Laura is I just ask people questions and as I ask the questions sometimes they don't have the answers and they're like oh I never thought about that let me you know and so it starts to kind of take shape and and it goes from there and it seems it's a it's really a simple process but it's as you know I'm sure it's just so much easier when somebody else puts their brain on it and looks at your blind spots or even maybe just encourages you and says you know what it's actually not as complicated as you think it is you could just do this or you could just do that so I would if you have a google doc and you start writing things down we could spend a few minutes and it would be you know off the clock obviously but I could give you some time every week to help you with that if you'd like well that's but I'm kind of really privileged to have you doing that for me because you know you're too busy and yeah it would be my pleasure it would be my pleasure honestly it's it's a great service and and one of my passions and missions is helping moms find work i've been so blessed i don't want to cry i've been so blessed to be able to stay home with my daughters and they have no idea that like they just think that this is life that moms can have time and they can have money and they can be there for everything and i'm like that is not what it's normally like whether they're married or not but definitely not for single moms and they don't know because that's the life that they had and i just think what a blessing that's been and i want to share that with as many moms as possible and what you're doing is a great way for me to be able to just add um add to i don't have to be the one in charge it doesn't have to be my thing i yeah because that's also the pain points that i'm seeing with all the
00:40:00 - Laura L
colleagues and friends that asking me what are you doing and then they could they would say I wish I could also what you're doing something like that so yeah that's also what I'm trying to I actually pray that I could also help them yeah yeah my thing that I ran into that was really hard is that people would ask me what I'm doing and then I would tell them and they wouldn't do the work yeah I would tell them all you have to do is like go apply to Upwork or go do this and like it's not fun sometimes to go right right for somebody else or to learn a new skill and you're not getting paid a lot of money but like you don't get to the good stuff quickly you have to work your way up and nobody wanted to do it like almost nobody this whole time 22 years Laura not one person actually followed through not one yeah that's it So the problem there is you wanted to help them, but they also not helping themselves.
00:41:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:41:06 - Laura L
I think they are what they're saying is that they are afraid of talking to clients. think the advice that I give to them is just be yourself. And then yeah, I think the client could see or could feel that if you are talking, I mean, you're from the heart and just honest of what the things that you can do and what are the things that you are willing to do like learn.
00:41:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and the other thing is I teach people, I mean, you can be afraid people want to avoid pain. And that's not that doesn't work because things are going to be hard and things are going to hurt. What you need to learn is that you can get over the pain quickly and the hurt won't destroy you, but it will teach you and it will be hard, but you'll be smarter because of it. And you'll be stronger because of it. And then you'll have amazing blessings because of it. And the other thing is, like if we were working with somebody that believes in God or as we're commanded fear not. We're commanded. not. It's not a suggestion. Fear not. Because God will help us. And so, like we don't have to be afraid of the hard things. We need to be willing to do the hard things. a lot of people just aren't. But sometimes maybe they just need to be encouraged. It's okay. some things are going to go wrong. And you're going to have some bad experiences, but you can't have the good ones if you don't try, you know?
00:42:39 - Laura L
Yeah, they're afraid. Oh, I mean, they are afraid to try.
00:42:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the thing. Yeah. And you can't fix that. But you can at least make a place and you can have some content that trains them and encourages them. And you can you can at least make make a space for them. if they choose it, they do and somebody will choose it. Somebody. definitely will choose it. Maybe not the ones that you want it to be, maybe not the friends that you care about. But somebody else will and it will bring you joy to know that you've helped another mom and another family.
00:43:13 - Laura L
Yeah, that's my prayer. hope that, yeah, it will come true.
00:43:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Speaking of family, there's a child. Yes. Yes. I am, but I'm almost done. Do you want to wait like a second? She's like, she's barbecuing for us right now.
00:43:31 - Laura L
She's making hamburgers outside on the grow. Oh, okay. need to go, yeah, go with your children and enjoy the barbecue.
00:43:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So if you have any questions, you can send them through Upwork. If it's complicated, and you want to make like a screen share, a loom video or something, then that works. then we can have these meetings regularly. If it's something complicated and you just want a separate meeting, we can do that. I'm really flexible with whatever is needed, and I'm just so excited.
00:44:07 - Laura L
I'm so excited. Yeah, me too. I'm really excited.
00:44:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yay! Okay, I'm gonna go take care of my daughter, and I hope you have an amazing afternoon, and I'm just looking forward to this.
00:44:20 - Laura L
Thank you, Tina. Yeah, I'll just go ahead and create the trailer board and then, yeah, send the link to you then.
00:44:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Thank you so much.
00:44:32 - Laura L
Thanks, Tina. Have a great day. You too. Bye. Alright, see ya.

Hey!
00:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey! so sweet.
00:00:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You look great. Your hair is perfect. Were you doing videos?
00:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nope. This normally what I do. I've just been really exhausted and seminary has disrupted my routine.
00:00:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Got it, got it. I'm smoking.
00:00:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm wall-stinging. So dry. Let's talk. Oh, I got, I got a new, you can't see it. Mike. Nope. Oh, because of the virtual background.
00:00:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I playing with backgrounds. Oh, nice. Nice, nice, Do you, I got back to everyone. I'm going to follow up the personalized room as well.
00:00:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mappier commented as well. Do you know him? I know of him. Look, it's a road up. I don't know how good it sounds. it's Yeah. So, It's $100 like the Yeti mic and but it sounds way better. It sounds as good as the Shure SMB 7 or something like that. Yeah, I know I've heard good news. Yeah, but it's USB, not XLR and it doesn't need any and it can plug into your phone and it doesn't need anything.
00:01:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No cloudlifter not phone to yeah.
00:01:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so I mean, I like technology. I play around with a lot of things and because one of the things that I want to do is create some recordings that are like, you know, I was talking about some of the like inspirational, but also specifically calming, soothing to get frustrated. sometimes you hear something good that is specifically engineered towards getting us the energy that we want to have in business. Anyway, I think sound quality is important. So. but also I like shopping sometimes. Only online, not in person, do not like in-person shopping. I don't generally like shopping in general, but I do like the new technology thing that I would share that. Okay, so Neil, what I know about him is I got some of his stuff. He does like war reform products and...
00:02:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, I was just checking out his page. Looks like he's got a pretty slick thing for shorts and stuff. But yeah, I think he would be... I don't know that well, but I imagine it'd be a really good client too. think a lot of these people... Yeah, they need the combo. They need the combo. I think it's unique. I think we've hit something and then I think we should also create some kind of low ticket offer that leads into this for them as well.
00:02:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who leads into it? Yeah, because I was thinking yesterday about how do we serve people who can't afford this, aren't ready for it. don't know if you heard it. And I thought I left it in the message, but I'm pretty sleepy. So I was saying that it was around the Cory Michelle thing, too.
00:03:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was thinking, I think I did here, yeah, after that.
00:03:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I was like, there are going to be some people who are not ready for the investment. Oh, OK, it was when, because you were talking about 5,000 or 6,000. And I was saying, I think it should be 6,000. And I don't think that we should do less and that it's more about that price will match for the person who's ready for it. Like, this is really targeting a specific type of person. I put the requirements in the document. And that $6,000 should be fine for that person. Now, some people, especially that are already on your list, are or you're going to want to serve them and help them. And so the tendency is, like you were talking about that lady who had a sliding scale. I'm like, sliding scale will modify the offer, so we won't modify the price. So the offer can change, which changes the price, right? So you get a different version. It isn't one-on-one, but what you could have is maybe just the plan, like that it's more generic, and how we would come about the plan. So here's how we would come about the plan. We would ask you all of these questions, and we would look at all of the things that you have. And here's some examples of how we would package things together, right? you can apply this logic to whatever offerings you have. And then this is the business plan, and this is the logic that we use to come up with this business plan. So you can kind of formulate your own based off of what we did as examples. Now, if you want to say, hey, Here's what I came up with is this is a good idea and have vox or access to us. Here is our $200 a month coaching or $400 month code, like whatever the vox or access would be. Yeah. And then, you know, maybe a call a week or two calls a month where you can come in and you could get like hot seat reviews, that type of thing.
00:05:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Um, so it's okay.
00:05:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Way cheaper. And it's along the same line. So we're staying in our lane, right? And which means that we'll get the testimonials and the referrals that we get will all be concentrated around the offer that we have, which, so all the traction, all the energy that we get, it will all be relative, which means that, that anybody coming to us should be hot and targeted, right?
00:05:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I love that idea. Like I was just going to say, that's sort of a little bit like, um, what do you call it? Alan Sotanic, what I pay 500 a month for, once a week he does a call, he's got the forum, right? But he doesn't do chat support or voxer support, but he's sort of in discord answering some people everywhere as well. And then on his three, four hour calls on Thursdays, you could ask a question. Um, so, so I do like that concept of what you're talking about, like you're thinking, because these people are excited and they don't, um, you call it qualify.
00:06:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what else can we give them? Is that kind of where?
00:06:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes.
00:06:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'll tell you what I like about this court is you can do audio recordings and replies and video recording and replies. then it's a, it's a chat and generally the people that are in discord are either active or they're completely negative not which is there's not a bunch of just but they're coming there for a purpose so they're either talking to each other or they're completely out of it because they don't like it and they only go in for you send them email here's the content so this is another option and thing to be because of the clips specifically the audio interaction.
00:07:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well yeah and what's interesting so you know is the discord what Alan does on his $20,000 mess run that I joined last year he will do a loom video for the feedback and he'll just give you the loom link so that's kind of cool as well.
00:07:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah and I would totally be willing to do that too but I don't want to do that for like a $200 offer of 400 or 500 would yeah so what are we really talking about them because like for me and I can just
00:08:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
open up Google and we can just start writing because the auditory I won't remember but if I open up Google Doc. So, well actually why don't we do a customer map? What's your customer map? File, we'll make a copy in our position. So, so technically we have like let's just call it high ticket, right? Right? Technically we have this one for the pocket CMO, right?
00:08:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me zoom in bigger. Want me to share this with you as well right now or do I want to wait? That would be great but I'm good with watching you while we do this though.
00:09:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I said in the Google background, if you saw that change to 12K in 2025. I love that. Yeah, six people.
00:09:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then we have to back that up and do that, and then I think that we could change the 12K also to 12 months and maybe also put in like a call once a quarter or something like that so that the value is stacked a little bit more.
00:09:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so what you're saying, so repeat kind of what you're thinking here, I was thinking like a full on low ticket funnel, but you were saying something else. It's like a lower fee subscription.
00:10:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I was saying, like, and I wouldn't really want to offer this until after we've done a couple of these because it would give us the framework to make that so much easier. But basically, they would get the same thing, but it would be a do-it-yourself version. So here is because what we're going to do is we're going to take a survey form that is thorough. It's basically an intake form that gets all this information from people. And from that intake form, we're going to figure out all the assets that they have and the skills and abilities that they have and formulate an offer stack for them, right? Front and like a low ticket, mid ticket, high ticket, if possible, and different types of offers and packaging that they can give and not necessarily that they should offer all of them, giving them some options. and showing them how they could package their products slash services differently. And in order to just have something, first of all, that's scalable, potentially. So potentially low ticket, mid ticket, high ticket, potentially something that is recurring, but it really depends on who they are and what they're offering. That doesn't work for everybody. But that's what we'll be looking at is what is the best way to leverage, whatever is that you have to offer to people. And then, do you want me to finish the?
00:11:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Try and thought, yeah, yeah.
00:11:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, so are you talking about what is the low ticket? So then the other thing would be we're going to create a business plan and say, here's the strategy that we would go about for you to make sure that you're not overextending yourself, like minimum viable product, really laser-targeted marketing using existing organic traffic. them. Coming up with the most leveraged business plan that they could have to mitigate loss and maximize profits. So that is very custom. That's what we're offering to people who's going to be talking to us one on one, which is a little bit more detail than I've given in the past, but since we've talked about this. But what this front end version could be is like here's examples of what we've done. We're not doing this for you, but we're going to show you our logic and we're going to give you these case studies or examples, right? So that you can put your own stuff through it and come up with a plan on your own and try to apply what was done because you can't afford it, or whatever reason, just choose not to invest in us on a higher level. But if you want support doing that, if you want some feedback, if you want to be able to get some help with it. And again, still don't want to pay the $6,000 price, then you can join our monthly group and you can quit anytime you want to. There's no commitment. So let's just say you want to come in and ask a bunch of questions. Then you get access to us for $400 a month. You can ask questions. You can, we'll have two live calls a month and it can be a couple hours long and bring your stuff, ask your questions. So that's still so it could be the front end is here's how we did it. Here's the framework, $97. The next upsell was if you want support while you came up with it, if you want feedback on your plan, if you want us to look at it and see how we would tweak it, adjust it, then you can come into the membership group for whatever $400 a month. And we'll give you feedback and if we're giving good feedback and it's going to take you what a launch that I imagine you're going to save for a few months, right? That's not enough you want to get there faster and you want us to really plan it out if you want access to a roll of X and who we would hire for this type of thing then it's the $6,000 one.
00:14:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I still can't visualize picture of the front end same thing but do it yourself version. Here's how we did it.
00:14:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's how you can model it. So you won't probably until we've done it for somebody and I was just about to say maybe we need to run through the client stuff and you know see most of you all but so yeah it'll look kind of. kind of like our calculators. like you've got the the funnels like right you've got that. So they would be able to get one of those and plug their stuff into it. I have a different version of things and we would have an outline of maybe it's a Trello board like a project suite that says because we can share Trello boards people can copy them and this would be stage one stage two stage three kind of thing or maybe copy just graphics development all the different moving pieces and create them into tasks that they would then you know modify but they at least have a framework and we could put etas of how long this type of task should be should take to do so really break down the whole cycle into actual task and in actual project management suite that they just import and so let's say they get a developer they just assign those tasks to their developer and maybe instead of school they're using circle or Facebook groups or whatever so they modify a couple of things but for the most part it's gonna be pretty duplicatable. I think that's super high value and I'd be okay with giving that away for $97 because I think we want to over-deliver below them away with everything that we do and basically prove like how much we know and understand and how valuable we are so because at some point they're gonna go this takes way too long even with all the amazing tools that we give them they're like I want more help and that's that's what we want is we want them to be sold on how helpful we are so that we're not trying to you know we don't have to work for sales calls they should basically be begging to work with us because they know what we know, they know where they answer and they're happy to give us their money. It completely changes the energy and the dynamic of their relationship versus when you go in like and somebody hires you and they're like okay prove to me you're worth my money.
00:17:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah yeah so yeah like we had like for my car for magic we have like I'm just going to share screen or show this we had a product called high ticket toolkit as well and it had like yeah four calculators crush your launch creating proper headache offers easy but and then we had a whole excel or csv so where they could just import into a sauna and have like all the tasks they have to do like
00:18:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I actually have a base camp project template that I use for my freedoms, huh?
00:18:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:18:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That I used to use for my freedom systems and if I, let me see if I can find it in my drive, I use a new project template, let me share screen with you for a second, is that okay? So this actually came from, this came from starting with building Ryan Moran's Shear Strength Labs, the 12 months to a million bucks you wrote. So, um, Well, let's see, project discovery, that's a whole new thing, right, is kind of defining the avatar. These are, these would be tasks that you start with, conversations that have to be had, meetings, exploration on the team. Like, it depends on who you're at, but if you're doing this for your, as your agent agency, then you're doing it for a client and you're doing it with them. So, and the note is here, remove any items that are not applicable to the funnel, but what we'll do is have it where it's, you know, project suite specific and just be able to export from one to another. But these things, right, define what it is, title was the price, who's responsible for creating the content. So, like, if the copywriter has one part, the graphic designer has another part, that type of thing. sometimes before you even get to the copywriter, you have to give. of product-specific information, so then it's kind of three part, right, because it's the product owner who has to inform the copywriter, and then the graphic designer should be entitled what they want, and generally the copywriter probably is going to inform that if they're really good at marketing and you're hiring a copywriter. Due date, stages, dependency tasks, things like that. Yeah. core offer up sales, that admin instruction tasks, labeling base camp tasks properly, creating client project folder and Google Drive, creating the following sub-folders, all these things for approvals.
00:20:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
There's a lot. So you can like make some like this, but in Trello, so it looks really pretty, people go all about it from a marketing perspective?
00:20:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And also, this could be a PDF that is broken down a little bit more and explained a little bit more, dressed up and made pretty. um, um, explain with some videos, like this could be a product all in and of itself. Um, I was going in a totally different direction.
00:21:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was going more, um, the front end, like a true low ticket funnel, like more about the end result, getting them on, whether it be go high level or system I owe, so that they become a customer that way. Like, so, so for instance, like, the thing could be a 37 or $27 in $14, like a lot of Alan's tannic students are making, you know, multi-million dollar low ticket files and they're using a $14.40 price. But I could be, we have to figure out who our avatar is on this one, but like, so for instance, it could be just one around, um, you know, here's like, just to get them hooked is that, you know, here's like, whatever, five years of winning Facebook ad formulas and actual ads that have helped me build to million dollar funnels. You could have this and even if it's five bucks, right? And then when they get that, say, you know, the thing that made it work, though, is a really good funnel software as well, besides the copy and everything. And so the next page, bump can be like, get all of our snapshots or templates, you know, here's some examples of some winning, you know, know, pages. I mean, that's what Anac Sentinel did. Like he at low ticket funnels. He's not the expert at it, but he just claimed ourselves a frickin' expert because he saw all the money in being a go-high level affiliate, right? So he bolted on front end to make a boatload of money on it. Like, there's sort of a joker down to 10x thing going. This guy never even made a million off of a lot things in funnel. Now he's like, but he's doing it. He's getting away with it. And of course, he's a great guy. He sells other stuff about information products. That's good. But uh, but anyways, so I was going around that angle, like, yeah.
00:22:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You made me think of something now. So that's type of organization, that is what I've inserted into every company that has become a million dollar company that wasn't before I got there.
00:23:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So how do we, and I'm not going to have the answer right now, and maybe you haven't, but how do you make that ? Because when I looked at it, my eyes glossed over little bit because I'm creative, right?
00:23:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the results are what ?
00:23:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
The work is not .
00:23:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a saying that says something um, looks like work and dressed like overall success, something like that is success. Looks like work, dressed in overalls. I don't remember what it is. Hold on a second. Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.
00:23:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I love that quote.
00:23:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's the thing is I am not going to if you like sucking your thumb, we are not going to work.
00:24:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
part together, right? If you're looking for passification, if you, I'm an I am a fast twitch explosive kind of person.
00:24:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I cannot sit still for long. If you're and now I am also like, I used to think I was lazy because I was always looking for the shortcuts. I'm not lazy, but I get bored easily. And I want to do lots of things. And I want to feel that explosive energy. So I gamify everything. There is no faster, easier way to do and to grow than what I've created. Because if there were, I wouldn't go into companies and have their mind blown every time. just that is why it's a fundamental like a lever is the most basic kind of tool you have a fulcrum. like a rock and a plank and the lifting power is exponential based on the size of the lever. It is as simple as it gets. You still have to do the lifting. You don't have to get the pull from. You still have to get the lever. It still works. But the power that you can do once you understand the lever and you do it, is amazing. Let's imagine that this guy is like, I can't do this job because I got to hire five guys to lift this big old thing and Joe blow up over here and he's tiny. like, I got you $25 and he brings out a rock and a stick and he gets it done by himself. That's magical. He's blowing the mind of these early dudes and five of them do it and it was so much more expensive. That is the power of working smarter or harder. Everybody tells you to do it. Nobody tells you how to do it. This is how how you do it. So it isn't . The work isn't . The results are . So, you know, you have to decide if you want front or back, but you don't get both.
00:26:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because if it's on the front, which means I don't do any work, you're not going to get big results.
00:26:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're not going to get big profits. You're not going to have a great company. You're not going on the front. You actually are smart and you do some of the work and you're organized and structured. Guess what you get on the back end? All this .
00:26:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And you get to keep it.
00:26:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm not trying to convince somebody and try to sell them and let them hear what they want to hear. If you want to go buy a diet pill instead of go to the gym, I'm not a person. If you want to go buy a lottery ticket to make your money, I'm not your person. And I want to be very clear about that. Yeah. But what I will tell you is. I've got the best plan for the gym. And I literally, Maria, for real, I go to the gym, I spend about 15 minutes, I do a leg press, and I do this one movement overhead. But it works. of those movements get all of my core.
00:27:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm sore from head to toe. My daughter went with me, she's like, that's crazy.
00:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My strength grows every week. I can lift more. only do it every couple of weeks. I have lost size. I don't eat less. I don't like, I'm not, you know, tiny or anything, but the power of that, and I found somebody else that explained it, but I have way less pain. I sleep better. I have more energy because I'm not exhausting myself going to the gym, building up cortisol. I still go to the gym. I'm just going to the gym way less and more powerfully than most people are doing.
00:27:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And it's the same thing in business.
00:27:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm doing. Project management like other people, but I'm precision about it and I'm getting the most out of the least every single time. So like, that's how you make it is that, you know, it is work, but it's the least amount of work that you can do to get the greatest amount of results. If you're not looking for great results, then this isn't for you.
00:28:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So, so, um, yeah, and essentially because if I look at my most successful companies, there's no doubt that at the beginning stages is because whether it be me or someone else, we had a really good project management or just more than that, everything you talked about because I remember I had base camp and even for every private client then that came to me, I actually put them on base camp and they had their separate workspace just for that, you know, um, so yeah. interesting, interesting. So I'm just trying to think and train of thought. And I might just have a bias that I need to remove. You know, the famous guy wrote the book Pay Yourself First, Profit First.
00:29:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know that guy?
00:29:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Profit First, yes. He was a client. Yeah, he was a client of Emily Hershey's and there was another very famous guy like that in that same area too. Like a lot about like a little bit about what you're talking about too. And we never could get ads to work for them. Like it just wasn't at the beginning that to teach them that. lot of people were like, yeah, but I get it. So yeah, it's just not coming to me with that front end would be though what we call it and all that. But you're right.
00:30:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Maybe we just
00:30:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
need to do it a couple of times for some clients first.
00:30:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I mean, we could call it a profit accelerator. It could be a business accelerator because accelerating is what it is, but it's also sustainable growth. So this is one of the biggest reasons I haven't created stuff because coming up with a hook is hard. That's where the longevity and the long play comes in, right? So people who are already familiar who just know, like this off, when you did a pocket CMO and COO, that created an immediate, there was an image that they could draw. They know what a CMO is, they know what a pocket is. They can imagine, I've got access, OK, that's actually really clear while still being incredibly ambiguous. Yeah, yeah. But they drew the picture in their own mind. So, using language that allows a person to fill in the blanks and draw the picture in their own mind is what we want to do, right? So, we want to allow them to draw the conclusions like, that's why we have words like blueprints and toolkits and accelerator that have been used in IM for, the beginning, blueprints gives you an instant thing, like, you know, like, that is the schematics, that is the line, that is everything top to bottom, you know, you like, I got to get work done, that's the thing, accelerator, all of these types of things, they, know what they mean, even if we don't know exactly the way that they would apply to work, and we don't even know that the person that's selling it actually.
00:32:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
actually has anything good.
00:32:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it a good toolbox or did you step from the dollar store? Like, you know, the power and the results are different. Is it a good blueprint or did you have a really bad architect and there are things missing and the measurements are off? assume that everything with those words are good. Yeah, that's what they were created for, but it doesn't. And so the value is a tied to that particular word less so than the actual product that's being sold.
00:32:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Does that make sense? Yeah, it does. It does.
00:32:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It does. can find that type of word for any of these offers that conjures up an image in a person's mind of the power. And by the way, it's a leverage power. So the leverage of a blueprint is clarity. know step by step what I have to do. leverage of a toolkit is is that when I have to put a name, into the wood. I know I have to do it, but how am I going to do it? I need the right tool, right? So that implies that I'll have what I need to accomplish the work. Accelerator means that it's going to go faster than it would if I didn't get this. It's an implied leverage to each of and they automatically kind of fill in the blanks of the value.
00:33:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah. There's someone just message me that I know a little bit not super well, but pretty well from another group. She was there for the program. She just messaged me. This is include implementation of the marketing plan. I said no, but if I was consulting on it, as you implement it in team to hire and more, team is behind the scenes expert behind hugely names like that of scale, like Dan Meredith, and you can pop on a comment with me and Tina if you want.
00:33:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll just see what she was. But yeah, you would even say, don't know if they know him, but Ryan Moran of capitalism.com Yeah, 12 months to $1 million because I'll say that should name of capitalism.com. Yeah. He also has an event called Capcom every year. He gets Damon John. He gets lots of big people.
00:34:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
what's this book?
00:34:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's the book called? Pretty sure it's 12 months to him. Your first year, right? that. Yep, Ryan Moran, Ryan, Daniel Moran, 12 months to $1 million. Not that he bothered acknowledging me.
00:34:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And the fact that we put it in base camp.
00:34:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, did all of that. And I was.
00:34:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Where's. She said, I don't need marketing strategy.
00:34:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For me, it's all about the integration at this point. Another word people call me is integrator When rocket fuel came out and that word came out that was like two people like you're an integrator. That's what you are Tina Is everybody likes labels?
00:35:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I Think because everyone knows me as marketing they're assuming it's marketing yet.
00:35:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I thought the docket was pretty clear about Operations and team and stuff that is interesting Yeah, so then maybe giving a background of who I am and what I've done and that like if they've ever read Traction or rocket fuel that I am the integrator for several seven and eight-figure businesses or have been. Do I have it?
00:36:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, we'll see what she says. She's been planning with me for the last three months, so I don't know if she'll pull the trigger because I don't know what she's just shopping around and cheap, I'm just gonna say that. Because then when I say playing, I mean, asking me questions too in Facebook questions or before being paid a dollar for stuff, right? but that is a perfect example where I find that fascinating. And maybe we just need to get more you and I together on video, Tina, because it is like even the product boss, how do they really get to one million? besides my marketing strategy, I had them hire an integrator as their first hire, right? You know. Oh, because, yeah, that I just like, oh, sorry.
00:37:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is what Matt said, um, just to make a correlation to things that people actually can know and do some research on. So he doesn't say share certain lives, but I get results. She came into our company when we were having some growing pains and needed help cleaning up our systems. that point, we were doing a few hundred thousand per month. Fast forward 12 months and we've increased our revenue 10 fold. Tina played a huge part and helping us do this. Robert released. took our ideas and visions and made them a reality. And we couldn't have grown this fast without her. Okay. So Matt, this is the partner of, oh, I'm not sharing that part of my screen. Sorry, stop sharing, share. Um, really not good.
00:37:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. What I can do is in the Google doc or if you want to, you can just put in some screenshots of more people, but this is all good feedback, by the way, right? To show, Hey, here's behind the scenes of these people, right? Um, I just know, um, like even Karina, how she got to me, she got disgusted with someone else. She paid 5k for. She didn't say the name. forget was, but this is like three, four years ago. She I bought it because included in her program was a, was a business plan. I really wanted the business plan, but the girls program didn't lead with that. The girls program was probably something like the 10k a month program, like it led with something like that. But the business plan was boiler template and she was so mad. And the coaches weren't the guru. It was $25 an hour. People she had hired, you know, so she was just like, ah, so, um, anywho, uh, yeah, um, I wonder.
00:38:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dan's always offering to share stuff for me, but he's also doing his own thing. So I don't know. I talked to my guy too, because they're business partners. Um, My guy is who got Dan Meredith to do, to even be recognizable at all. So I'm Dan's first coach that he ever hired. And then because we worked together, I introduced him to my guy who has, you know...
00:39:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hold on, I'm just want to make sure that Kat's not pinging so much.
00:39:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
on. Okay.
00:39:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, it's okay. No, I think she must have just been playing with something, but you know when Kat kind of do the scratch, scratch, before they go pee? Yeah. So that's what I was worried so no I think she must have just been trying to get a spider or something in the corner.
00:39:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That we might be able to get more. for eyeballs on it from a group that is familiar with me.
00:40:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
what I do is what I was saying. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I also think maybe Friday, instead of a webinar and all that stuff, we're trying to figure out. Maybe it's you and I doing just a true podcast style interview. We're just talking to each other and I'll just say, Tina, why is having systems so important? And we just we have a little bit of a structure, but it's really just us talking saying, hey, we're doing this video because some of you may not know me or you, Tina, then we both share it with our audiences, something like that. Because my people, I think they're so used to me being, I'm just going to say, at low price and do stuff for them.
00:40:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like remember the last offer was $2,000.
00:40:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'll create the whole front end. So I think they're having sticker shock, right? eight um so potentially because she hasn't um she said send me a link and i'll and i'd love to talk to you you too this is this on a girl amanda but uh amanda who hines hines she does wholesaling she's in my laurel portay seven dollar month ads group that i'm in um and uh so uh uh i'm definitely open to it send me a link to discuss and i can match it to my availability so um yeah i think i'll just have to send her a link to when you and i are available to to talk to us but uh i i don't want to fight from the business either oh i won't yeah so so it's like you know she's already trying to position herself you know i mean um so versus like i can just put up and nothing held back now like hey five hundred dollar run out of her one hour our strategy cash injection plan with me. So just to piece, you know, for the next week for casual, but I don't want to fight for her. Like, you know, she doesn't see the value. I'm not going to, you know, yeah.
00:42:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I didn't even do like a one-on-one call. So here's the thing. What I would say is if you want to do a call with us, first you have to fill out the form. Okay, like I told you before, you don't get to talk to me unless you're qualified to talk to me. And if you aren't, if you need to be convinced, go convince yourself or I'll find somebody else, but I don't, you're not worried about you.
00:42:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah.
00:42:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where I'm coming from is that all fairness, all these people don't know who you are, right? No, that's okay, but I'm saying for you too. Like, you don't need to be worried about them. So if they need to be sold on you, but for your time, like your one-on-one time, even... or like a sales call, look, before, because you don't want to sell somebody who's not qualified.
00:43:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, they just call it like, yeah, you know, she makes enough and all that. Yeah, yeah, because I'm in the same group, Laurel. That's why she wanted to hire me for ads because her low ticket funnel is really done well. She's done well and she sells a low ticket funnel on how to do wholesale real estate investing. And it's done really well. But she's still not the ideal perfect avatar, don't think, because the other ain't danger.
00:43:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is a good conversation we're having because who we want to really help.
00:43:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. The other day, just having someone who just started making money online and just, you know, started to have success with their funnel. So, they're going to be very, most of them, unless they've run real business before with people and stuff, they could be very, probably how you disrupt court and show. They could be very like, just like, yeah, you know what I mean? just, you know. Needy or cheap or whatever and so like you like like the perfect avatar and obviously he's a friend So he wouldn't do it right wouldn't make sense to be my friend Derby right who's run many companies He's in his early 50s or late 40s probably 50. Yeah, no, he's definitely was 50s. think but you know He's already made millions of dollars in the past. He's also lost it but he hasn't really Stuck with something he's a little bit like me So he wasted 25 grand on Russell Bronson's circle thing about two years ago Why did you buy that and then now he's struck it rich again because he's always striking rich He'll always keep trying stuff. He's making about 40,000 a month or recurring from his Airbnb He converted one of his apartment village in New Jersey It was like eight unit into Airbnb's and he's now making grants making 35 to 40 grand a from like 15 years ago doing SEO consulting for local businesses And he's still getting $500 checks from businesses from 12 years ago. So he has a funnel I created for him last year for it. And it was doing pretty good. But he got frazzled because he was trying to do everything.
00:45:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Those are the perfect people that that's who needs me the most. Because I think I've experienced a little bit how quickly I can focus you. And so instead of like you, you still are thinking about other things, but you're staying in a lane and you're not letting it. So you're not doing the things at the cost of what's most important. That's generally what people do. And so I can literally just a text message, a boxer message, whatever, very short thing, get somebody anchored. So like my attorney's wife, my client who's an attorney hired me for his wife. And she is a nurse practitioner, but there's a business opportunity in community. and helping organize things and structure things. But she's never operated like this before. She is not native to America. She doesn't speak English, but it's not her native tongue. There's a lot of things that she's frustrated with, but she's very smart and she's very capable. And so she's had some issues that have kept her from doing the things that she needs to do. In simple text messages that took me five minutes to write, she shifted and shifted immediately and for the rest of the time. then so once a week I just text her, see how she's doing. She tells me the things that's stressing her out. give her a quick little, it's like an inspirational message. But it's tactical. It's like, this is what's happening. This is why it's happening. So now that you know it's happening and you're conscious of it, now you know why it's happening and you're conscious of it. Here's a strategy that should work according to what I know about your personality that you can implement. And then they get buy-in because they say... you're right, I will do X and now in a matter of minutes, something that because there was no clarity, they weren't conscious of it. They weren't clearly conscious of it. They weren't conscious of the cost to them or a tactic to stop the thing from happening. Yes, I can give that to people in minutes. So, you know, having a conversation about that, teaching people and that gets back to jeans, shorts, levels of awareness, right? What do you call that? don't know, but I know it exists and I know it can find it and I know it can be fulfilled. Yeah. Technically, I think that's what, like, so I've never called myself a business coach. Other people call me business coach. I hate it. I've said consultant, operation manager, project manager, like operations consultant, but I get called business coach.
00:47:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
People just call me coach. Hey coach. Hey coach.
00:48:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need that yeah, and it's because you know, it's it's strategy. It's tactics but it's also look you need to do this you need to do that and and it's not a specific thing right it's business related so if you hire a soccer coach soccer coach might tell you how to eat might tell you how to think might tell you to get to bed on time I tell you it's a homework done so you're it's not in your head might tell you all kinds of things it has nothing to do with soccer per se yeah impact your game so the same thing with business coaching is you know but there are a lot of crowd people out there and there's not a lot that can do what I do and then there might be people who like well if she's so good why is she just doing this well because my priorities mom I'm serving the mission I'm going to school I'm not out here trying to get a yacht I'm just living my life and help you along the way so that's an uphill battle because people have scripts in their head about what people look like what successful people look like and that kind of thing. So anyway, that's all the stuff that we're dealing with. But once you start to get testimonials and come up with a particular name that has that word that conjures up something, right, like blue kit and blueprint, like toolkit, things like that.
00:49:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
if we get some names for that particular offer where they're like, this is what happened, this was amazing and they tell them Yeah, like really, when you think about it, and it might just be people just need more exposure as well. It's sort of a bit like the strategic coach. I think I mentioned that guy to you before. He's in Canada and like Scott Alford hires him, like a lot of people work at steel hires him. Let me see, like a lot people already making a lot of money, know, or , got to hire this guy because I don't have a life after I've, you know, done. I'm so well in my business, so let's see all these things, or if anything to Dan Sullivan, that's it, that's just a DJ coach, this guy, I mean they don't go in implement for people, like they're like, yeah, you know, Dan Sullivan, as in like the class, like the marketer and copywriter, like that's been around for decades business. He's picture of this guy.
00:50:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know what he looks like, but yeah, no, no, I'm sharing screen right now.
00:50:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know, I still don't know what Dan Sullivan looks like. Oh, got you got you got it.
00:50:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, but yeah, he's on par with Dan Kennedy and a lot of ways in terms of like how long he's been around and, and yeah, so. Business strategy is definitely a huge part of what I offer and do But I don't have a brand and I don't have you know a pedigree.
00:51:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So You're also not paying his prices. We have results. We have the results. Yeah, okay, so Other than that where were we so And that's just one person, right?
00:51:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's plenty of other people that I just said the Google Doc too So I'm interested in in talking to Neil and seeing I mean I don't know what or your forum stuff and I don't know how he organizes his business. So I Don't know enough, but I know that he knows a lot about business I know he knows a lot about the market. So if he's interested in it, I would imagine there's I Know some need not being met for him and I'd be curious what what sparked his curiosity in it.
00:51:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hmm.
00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And one of the other conversations to start having is, like, raise your hand if you've heard of rocket fuel and raise your hand if you've heard of an integrator, like, has anybody looked at that go? I wish I had an integrator. Well, that's what Tina is, and that type of thing, because again, it's a correlation to something that they already have a definition for in their head, and they've already attached a value to it if they're familiar with it. So, by translation, by saying this integrator thing that you've already got, and it's established about saying she's that, and she's been doing it for these companies to go, oh, wait a minute, okay, I could have access to that, like, and Maria's standing, like, working with her, so Maria must think that that's useful and good. You could even tell any, like, if you have anything to share about anything that you feel like I brought value to you for, like, you will imagine. And we were just talking we weren't even like I didn't hire anything, but just in talking Yeah, I felt this did this and this is how I feel about it now and because not everything is going to be a like it's going to be an indirect financial game, so We had a conversation about your center and your values and I didn't say anything about Karina, but you Took what was said and you knew like this is where I'm stuck right now I'm not doing what I should be doing and I need to make a change. didn't know that I you knew that but I Facilitated a thought in your head that made that happen with clarity for you and then you went and did that and and that's the type of thing It's very difficult to explain how that happens unless you've had the experience. Yeah, yeah-hmm But you've been on fire since you let that weight go
00:54:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, I know, I know, it gets down a little bit because that later I had to finish that 2K Final Four, which still burns me because she paid the 2K on Thursday and Friday and so Karina got like 1200 of the 2K and the next day Karina's like, I don't think this partnership is working, you know. I met with her today to go over her customer journey and everything, hey, this is almost done. She, so this is digital products, right, think she's going to do really well because she does well on Etsy selling some of these digital planners for co-parenting custody and productivity for months. And then she goes, well, no, I'm going to buy Karina's $5,000 one-on-one coaching site because I want to stick with, I want to also grow my e-com store because I started with her. I'm just like, oh, . She's never going to make that back. She's been with Karina for over six months and she's only broken even, you know.
00:54:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I their lessons.
00:54:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
had to learn yours. That's true. theirs. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So I was just like, I really was shocked because, um, yeah, I, like, because she thought I could run her traffic for her for like really cheap, she goes, oh, next week we start traffic for this. So wait, that's not not in scope for the 2K, you know, and so I, I was just like, if you want that, I could still honor the traffic package I offered a while ago for, for people if it was just one campaign and managing the ad spend is $1,000 a month, which is like it should be like 3K month.
00:55:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so anyway, uh, your effective hourly rate should never be less than 500. You, Maria specifically, know, shouldn't be less than 500. So I need you to engrade that, engrain that in your head, um, because that's the result you get. So if somebody is not qualified to pay that or doesn't want to pay that, that conversation can end very quickly and it's okay.
00:55:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes. Well, exactly. And I think the issue has been because I've been around Crena's crowd, right? These are all people who who just barely can make paying the shop if I'm not paying You know what you should do is you should write a pedigree post.
00:56:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is my history. This is who I am. This is what I've done. And for a little while I've been playing small. You don't have to say anything about it. Now this is not to say I don't believe in low ticket funnels. I do. I think that there's a lot of value in it, but because I think because I've seen them grow you know million dollar per year or whatever businesses, but I want to be very clear that I am not a low ticket person. This is the value. This is what I bring to the table. And somehow sometimes people make a correlation between the low price of an offer and the low price of time with me and let me make sure that you understand that they're not the same thing.
00:56:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love that. Because it's not your results speak for themselves.
00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah and it's maybe or even rethink having the school group as free like I'm tempted just to put a you know whether five buck a month or 47 bucks a month on it right now because I notice it's attracting a lot of people as well that are uh do you want to do you want to turn that into something we do together we can split the school price and just start go let's go create let's start having conversations in there every week um we can have a couple every week if you want to and just go like gangbusters on learning them but them learning us because there's no way we start talking and people show up and they're not going to get that really smart I went to traffic conversions one time and Richard Linder was not a partner yet and he was teaching email stuff and I'd been managing email list for a while and I knew a lot about deliverability and sender score this was 13 years ago almost 12 years ago people didn't know this then um but I did because our emails weren't getting through and I needed to figure out why because that was costing us a lot of money and I don't like losing money. By the way, while getting paid $15 an hour to turn a company into a million dollar company and going bankrupt while getting divorced, like I got some issues. Anyway, so I kept asking questions and he's like, you're really smart, aren't you? then I walked out of that room and I could hear people pointing at me whispering about how smart I was in digital marketing. So this isn't about arrogance, it's a point like I stand out even in crowds of smart people. There are a few that I get around and I'm just like, they're their brilliance and I see that they do a lot of what I do but they're also very quiet. They're not out there doing big things like big things publicly privately. There is many like eight figures, seven, eight and nine figure businesses and they're the masterminds behind it that nobody knows about. But when you hear them talk, you know, yeah, you're like that, but you've been, you focus on the marketing so much. But when you talk about strategy, people are like, holy crap, every single time, but yeah, well, that's why Emily hers hired me to be the strategy director. Yeah, like it was I never heard of her until one of my clients hired her, but then they went back and because they undid everything she did because ultimately it didn't work for them.
00:59:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah, she was I don't know if she's changed now, but back then she was pretty bad.
00:59:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like it was like two years ago.
00:59:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, really? Oh, well, then it's just she grew too fast and like some of the ads managers are really good. So it's maybe some bad. But yeah, for her, basically, then a strategy director, I would be helping like not helping that be crafting the strategy for Amy Porterfield, Mary Forley, I look at Gabby Burstein, those were her clients, right?
01:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know that.
01:00:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. Um, I think she still has those clients.
01:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She kept in the referral because she started. you that's, that should be part of your, like your pedigree.
01:00:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
01:00:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Seriously, Maria, just spend like the next week riding down the, the who's who, the stories, the money, the whatever. That should be a whole thing. Because the next time somebody is like, well, you know, it'd be like, hold on, go take a read down and then make it done.
01:00:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, I think that's good. So, and, and then, so, yes, a member I suggested maybe we just share school group. So I think the freebie group, even though they say that's good, was like having a free Facebook group, because school, the nature of school, you're getting a lot of people who just want to spam others. We always have to keep spam. if we make it 10 bucks a month or five bucks a month, it'll keep those people out and it could become like a newsletter alternative.
01:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or we decided. So that was one of the things I was thinking about with the community. is rather than email because you also can email, but only like once a week or three times a week, something like that. I don't remember. Once a day school, you can't. So if you do a post, you can email that out. It will send an email notification to people, but there's a limitation to three days. Okay. Yeah. So that's fine. But either way, putting out content like that, right? So rather than not instead of email, but in addition to for people who don't necessarily want email, but they like the groups and they like socializing. But yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:01:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So what do you think? We could always just keep increasing it every month, maybe five bucks for this month, 10 bucks next month, 15 next month, or do you think we just go right to 27 a month?
01:01:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, we could just go with the dollar. So we keep people there and then say, okay, month, and let's go just add value.
01:01:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So we immediately stop the spammers because you have to put in a credit card, right? Correct. Yeah, they affiliate markers and I'm I'm pretty sure we should be able to convert a free school community into a paid Yeah, you can you can and obviously we can we can just call this digital marketing or something like we don't I again. I never claimed the URL because we could change it whatever we want so Yeah Well that guy looks good and I don't let in people they don't have Anything you know what I mean and I'm almost almost tempted to not like guys in anymore Cuz all the free onboarding calls I've had that I stopped now the good ones were with the females But the guys just said just want to pure like what about this? about this? about this here?
01:02:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, it wasn't enjoyable the energy was different Maybe just a business acceleration because it's not just marketing. We're going to be talking about everything business acceleration strategies or Something like that
01:03:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, yeah, looks like we can do that.
01:03:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
01:03:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I'm making a buck right now.
01:03:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Five bucks, 10 bucks, whatever you feel like just. So people that don't pay it. I don't know how that works. Like, do they get to stay?
01:03:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know what happens, but. No, they all get grandfathered in.
01:03:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay.
01:03:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, so if you do month and annually. they do five bucks a month for the year, usually five months. Five times five is 55, 55 for the year. 8%.
01:03:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just can't wait. Five times too long. Yeah, because otherwise it'd be 65.
01:03:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
01:03:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Whoa.
01:03:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, okay. Yeah. Yeah. So instead of 55, it's not making a 40. I just want to make it five months worth. Five bucks gets seven months free. But how do I. . Oh, that's. Yeah. All right. I think it just means that these people are free and the rest have to pay five bucks, I think.
01:04:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Anybody else?
01:04:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anybody now? Yeah. So let's just go incognito and I have a call in five minutes. Is there anything else that you want to cover before I jump off the call?
01:04:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. So if we're going to do that together, you can make me an admin. If you want, you can build me for half of the thing. Like, let's talk about the details and whatever, how, you want to do it. We can talk about branding and strategy.
01:04:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
know I'm $25 a month.
01:04:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. then I think let's, let's build out a scale of like what is going to be next month and through the end of the year and just I don't know. Like, I think that would be a good plan. Oh, that's my love. I want to get him.
01:04:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All right.
01:04:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, catch up.
01:04:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We'll catch up soon because he's like, oh, I love it.

Yeah. Sir.
00:00:21 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:00:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How's the week been?
00:00:25 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Pretty good. Good. Nothing. Nothing out ordinary. No, no drama. Just moon here disappearing. That's it.
00:00:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This doesn't happen with his daughter.
00:00:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Are you there? I can't hear you. we're because I'm gonna switch to my laptop. How can I do this? I don't know if I can do this work. This is my fear.
00:01:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can hear you now.
00:01:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That's weird. It's like my volume or something. So Eric's sort of freaking out about it. I do, you can freak out. But he is.
00:01:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, I don't know if you said something, but wasn't there something wrong with Mani or his daughter?
00:01:39 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. He's got like a six month old that's got some sort of viral something.
00:01:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, she had to see a RSB?
00:01:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No. But he lives in India. I can stick in India front with the best place. to music based on what I was checking. And cells in their last. Oh, something weird is happening in the zoom. What's this? That's weird. Something on zoom is like. Going in and out. I can see it on the screen, but I don't know what it is.
00:02:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, something in zoom is going in and out.
00:02:38 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, like something was turning green and then red.
00:02:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But.
00:02:47 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, I don't think I don't have. I mean, if I turn up the iPods. And you have to switch to laptop. Which I lose my big screen. How do I not have pulling in headphones here? Don't go. Cause I don't use for your headphones.
00:03:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's why. Well, uh, and it's a PC Mac, but like it's Bluetooth though.
00:03:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
You should be able to pair AirPods with it. It is. They're just whatever's happening is happening. I don't know what's happening.
00:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I mean, worst case scenario, you could call in and still share screen.
00:03:40 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Finally enough, that's what I was, that was my original plan. And then I was like, no, I'm going to, I'm going to try it. That's what you get for trying, Dan.
00:03:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know. trust the technology. I was playing around with. day period yesterday and um for either what do you call it have them or zoom i i set up two different ones oh i wasn't sure like you were hearing and dialing it anyway um my goal what i want to be to do is have it extract any of the comments from the transcripts that are mine and see if there's anything that's like is that a value or principle that i have right is that something that i was teaching or whatever so it can kind of put in my library of stuff yeah um so we'll see if it captures anything today what's the zap doing um so there's one that goes from fathom that's supposed to extract this transcript and but the fathom zaps weren't really in the So I honestly don't expect to do anything. Also, it wasn't really clear to me, and I'm not as a pure user, really. And then the zoom one, it went from a zoom transcript to, and I wasn't sure that I choose the right thing. It's like it has a built-in parser, but you don't see the parser. It just shows you the different things, but it's looking and acting like a parser. So I think that's what's happening. But anyway, so it goes from that and then dumps it into a Google Doc, the transcript into a Google Doc, and then you interact with chat TPT in that recipe and that's up and give it a message. And the message is, I want you to extract anything, you know, that's said by Tina Marie and, you know, store to my library. whatever that all the instructions that I wanted to do. So we'll see if it does anything. I imagine it's going to be several iterations and tweaking and probably some customer support, but if somebody else hasn't already thought of that and done that to be like, okay, let me build my library of my own content kind of thing. I'm sure I'm not the only one who's thought of it.
00:06:22 - Dan’s iPhone
I have a buddy that's well, Vans. Vans, I don't even know what the he's talking about. But he is like, you know, he's not trading crypto anymore because his buddy traded the account. So he went down the AI rabbit hole and he is building personal exactly what you're talking about. Like, it's you and AI is what he calls it. And he's he's built this thing where you feed the AI your stuff. And it becomes like an extension of you. So I was I turned him on. like, oh, it's like second brain. It's like, what's that? told him. Um, but he's like super duper into this now where he built one where like, I mean, might get this wrong, but he was saying like he's built one that like a preacher can use to help write his sermons, but you're constantly feeding it your stuff. And then you're asking it things from you, from you. Like you're asking new questions or something like, I don't know, but he says it works great. He's like super freaking jazzed on it.
00:07:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like, okay. Yeah, I can't remember because, um, almost a year ago, there was one that I was starting and I created a Tina bar. even remember what it was now. I'm doing a search and I can't find a thing. I originally started it.
00:07:59 - Dan’s iPhone
It's crazy how much more there. is one. He built it himself. So he's he's building it like yeah, we're using chat using open AI 4.4 or four lower cases.
00:08:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, whatever the hell it is. And probably Python because chat TBT can tell you how to do it and build it. They're not hard to build. No, yeah, I abandoned it in the first place because I'm like, I'm going to go build my own. And then I couldn't get one single file to be found. And it like for days that kept happening. I'm I'm not gonna tell me to spend days on this.
00:08:37 - Dan’s iPhone
Totally. Eric and I were working on something for quick and flowing. We needed to do like a date reformat. I was trying to send it to Zapier. Reformat it and then bring it back in. But when you brought it back in to high level, like you couldn't you couldn't get it back into high level in a way that you could use it the way that we needed basically. Just it wasn't going to happen. So then we were like, he was like, oh, we could use the custom code function. They have this new custom code function that it's JavaScript only. And I go, okay, great. Just have chat GPT write the JavaScript. And he's like, I've never done that. so I don't know what his prompt was, but he gave it a prompt to write this date reformatter code. It spit out the code. Then he had to figure out how you present that code in this function inside of go high level, which took a couple tries, but then ultimately it worked. It was like, holy , dude. So now we can have chat GPT write this JavaScript whenever we need to use in this custom code block. And then right after that, He's they're complaining about how Munir blah blah blah blah blah like what are we gonna do and Somewhat jokingly, but not really I'm like Gutenberg blocks their JavaScript. I go. Why don't you just ask chat GPT, but that's how to make a Gutenberg block.
00:10:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, you said and It does He's like, can I can I explore this?
00:10:28 - Dan’s iPhone
go absolutely like you so now if we have these finished blocks that need to be tweaked That seems a lot easier to do than just start Building blocks from scratch not having ever built a block, right? So you know Munir's experience is baked into these blocks, but he didn't invent the code He just knew his way around so I go.
00:10:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I guarantee you I was just gonna say I bet because we're the GPT for oh, um the token limits have increased exponentially. But you could probably dump as much of his code and you could dump multiple snippets. the limitations that used to be, you can only upload four or five files at a time. And the last time I uploaded eight at one time in one session, one comment. And, but you could like have it look at his code and say, you know, is there, do you anticipate any compatibility issues with your code in this code?
00:11:38 - Dan’s iPhone
Yep. Yeah, and it's like, and they, this one, and there's code, I think they want to borrow from one block and bring to another. So I'm like, if you have the code, then you can probably give it what the code and say, hey, this code does XYZ. I need to take that and put into this. So he was like. Oh my God. So that's why I'm like, Muneer's not really part of the team. Anyway, we can now, we wouldn't have been able to ride all these blocks on our own with Chad TBT, like it wouldn't be anywhere near as good, but now going forward, we can maintain that and extend them came over.
00:12:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Which would be great. I still keep thinking about whatever Muneer's done. So I had one dollar almost die from RSV and it's really common.
00:12:32 - Dan’s iPhone
Six months is the age, the page.
00:12:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's usually between two months and two years, but it basically think of COVID, but for babies.
00:12:43 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, yeah.
00:12:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know what it is.
00:12:45 - Dan’s iPhone
He just didn't, he didn't indicate anything. was. But I will.
00:12:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. It is. It's a new. age. I've been spending I don't even spend a lot. Okay, this is how weird it is. I was on the gym last night and normally I can't do my workout without like a particularly paced type of music. It has to be at a pace to keep my energy and my heart rate going or I just kind of start to fade. But I was talking to GPT. I was like banging out chapters and telling stories and stuff. It was just so weird. I was just watching myself. I'm like, I'm walking through the gym talking to a robot. It's just so weird. It's so weird.
00:13:43 - Dan’s iPhone
But it's awesome.
00:13:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's crazy. Okay, so here's one thing that I did. last night I was telling the story and I was talking about how it's crazy to me that a year ago I started lifting weights. And my primary thing at that point was just trying to heal my immobility, my mobility, but because I couldn't, I could barely move my shoulder. I had frozen shoulder, I had really bad tennis elbow. Glenn couldn't help me. I think because Glenn was bathing me too much because he's like, you're in a lot of pain and I just don't want to mess it up. Like he was scared and that wasn't helpful to me. But anyway, so I was telling it, I'm like, I started going to the gym and I was trying to heal something. And then what I've noticed is that within a few months, know, my I wasn't having that pain anymore. But then other pain I didn't even know I had was going away. Like I realized that I'm popping up and down the stairs, carrying, having things and my knees like feel great. But I didn't really, lies how bad they had been feeling going down the stairs and that I was I was bending my knees out when I would go down the stairs like I was changing how I walked because it was hurting and I'm like now it's a year later and some of my muscle groups are increased by 200% and others by 300% based on you know how much I can lift and how fluidly and whatever and but I really have only been going once maybe twice a week and sometimes some months it was only like there would be 11 day gaps between going or 16 day gap was the longest one when I was sick but I'm like even still like my body composition has changed completely I've lost inches and I don't have any pain anywhere ever even with fibromyalgia and it was just crazy but I was I was telling it I'm like this is an application for everything in life even business if you show up consistently everything improves. You don't even have to do it every single day. But if you if something is on your mind constantly and you keep applying yourself to it, there will be improvement. And there will be improvement you didn't anticipate happening. And so I was just like store this because I'm gonna I need to find a place to use it. And it's like, okay, let's put this into building a solid foundation chapter two. And I was like, what the. So it rewrote my chapter, inserting my story, and then pulling it out for the different sections that we had already written and finished. And that was really cool. Because GPT for like the one before this could not have done that.
00:16:46 - Dan’s iPhone
Right.
00:16:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Those iterations are wild that this and but like we really only started using this about a year and a half ago. Right. Now look at what it's at. And the pace is only going to get faster because the learning models are feeding each other. We've got all these new engineers on it and new prompters plugging data into it, learning how to work with it. That pace is just going to go crazy. So in terms of like teams. Who we need to do what some things are just going to be not necessarily obsolete, but how they show up is going to need to be different. So people that were. Show up and I do this in my job kind of thing, right, that coast coasting is going to go away for most of these positions because people hiring them are going to be like at your pace, I could go get a robot to do that. Well, I need you to do is take what I can't do and be strategic and say, do this, that, the other thing, but anyway. It's eye-opening, what it can do.
00:18:06 - Dan’s iPhone
It's a brand new world, as they say.
00:18:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. it keeps being a brand new world. That's what's even crazier. like blink and it'll change. Okay. um, or start, um, kind of what do you call it? Like prompted by thinking about what to give us role in what he's doing. And even more after the conversation we just had. and also, like, so just to recap what I was talking about last week. Um, to look at where you're at, where you're going by the end of We're taking a look at it. Potentially. wanting to do something with Joe where you've got multiple people on it of a certain type. know, I just want to really look at what we're working with right now and just kind of get an update visual on where we're going. So anyway, you had it in like, it was a flow chart type thing. I feel like I can't remember what it was called. I know because I've used it for years, but I don't use it consistently.
00:19:39 - Dan’s iPhone
I said, your guess is as good as mine.
00:19:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It wasn't like mine, Meister, but it was something like that, like, gliffy, gliffy.
00:19:48 - Dan’s iPhone
You either loose the chart or if you think it was gliffy. I know I used both at different points in my career.
00:20:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know, oops, but I really do think it was goofy, because I don't really use listed charts, but it could have been, let me just search my fee.
00:20:12 - Dan’s iPhone
I'm just going to log in and see what's where.
00:20:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

It's hurting me. My neck, neck, shoulder.
00:22:02 - Dan’s iPhone

00:22:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We had Stacy do the last arm chart now that I think about it.
00:22:16 - Dan’s iPhone
Nope. No, she didn't.
00:22:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Let me search Tumor for arm charts, see what we can find.
00:22:28 - Dan’s iPhone
No one to glippy. Yeah. Your account has expired.
00:22:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I, you know, I just got the same thing.
00:22:37 - Dan’s iPhone
I don't want to buy it. Where's the preversion glippy? Right. I don't know if there's anything in here. I don't want to buy. I don't want to That's all I know. All right. I haven't had what, I haven't had a Glyphia accounts 2019, I don't think Stacey was here.
00:23:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No.
00:23:24 - Dan’s iPhone
Oh, I think it's actually in Google. I think it's a Google, what you're going to say.
00:23:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, like a flowchart.
00:23:33 - Dan’s iPhone
Whatever their thing, their slide thing.
00:23:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because we did have her do something. Okay, yeah, that sounds about right.
00:23:54 - Dan’s iPhone
doesn't seem like it's been that long. The one that you and I missed. Or that this is the last. What I mean, that is so grossly complicated. So this ain't it or if it is, it ain't.
00:24:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you got?
00:24:15 - Dan’s iPhone
Let's see. Wait, hold on, looking at what other ones I have. And here's Bobby, did this one come for? Yeah, I mean, this doesn't even have Stacy on it. This was accurate at some point. This is what I thought it was going to be. It ain't this.
00:25:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh. Let me see, like, let me open my assume more. No, going. Oh, yeah. Um. David, look, I forgot about him.
00:25:28 - Dan’s iPhone
He's still mad.
00:25:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is he?
00:25:31 - Dan’s iPhone
Oh, yeah.
00:25:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
00:25:38 - Dan’s iPhone
No, he worked out of the office. He comes here, like, multiple days a week.
00:25:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sometimes I'll...
00:25:45 - Dan’s iPhone
What does he do? He doesn't do anything to me. Oh. He just works out of here, I should say.
00:25:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He can't do He He doesn't have lunch sometimes, because I think, Brandon... Mm-hmm.
00:26:08 - Dan’s iPhone
I mean, more when you own the building, that's what I'm in office space for years, like I've never ever charged him. He's been in the last two, right? I don't think he ever came to the one and he's a skate one or he never worked out there, he worked out a skateboard one, skate shop one. He's a little to do stuff. He's great. Don't need him yet.
00:26:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, let's see. Can you share that so I can look at it without squinting? he's squinting. Yeah, zoom or email with.
00:27:15 - Dan’s iPhone
Oh, there we go. Your share is free.
00:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. yeah. Okay. Okay, where's the zoom in? Okay. Where's that? Seriously. It will not zoom. Okay. All right. Holly. Well, now, so this isn't labeled. Okay, that is basis. Oh, who's Holly?
00:27:59 - Dan’s iPhone
That was the. the role. So Holly was the person at the time, I was like, oh, was going to be somebody it would be her. That now became Stacy.
00:28:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so let's change that.
00:28:18 - Dan’s iPhone
But that sort of role still.
00:28:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I she's more like, what would you call her?
00:28:27 - Dan’s iPhone
I don't know that I'm not good at that. I don't I don't do titles. So I don't use them and I don't grant them.
00:28:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's kind of my issue with org charts and like corporate style type organization for small businesses because I call it compartmentalized rules.
00:28:51 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, I call her a side. Like, what if what does Stacy do? like, she's my sidekick. I don't know what that is.
00:29:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would call it more like administrative supports because you being admin but like she helps in everything and it's generic but that's because she does so many different things.
00:29:20 - Dan’s iPhone
I mean she's yeah exactly it's like project management but it's not much because it is I don't know but I'm not going to get hung up on that because it's for nobody so right well if that's the case then do you not want to do this at all? No no I'm just saying so here it is I mean this is way less than this right it is so like you don't have anybody for sales it's you no it ain't me I don't even know sales like this I mean I'm not thinking about like you talking to Joe are you talking about anybody anybody that's
00:30:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
interested in working with you is because you've talked to them. So if sales exists, it's damn.
00:30:06 - Dan’s iPhone
I wouldn't even say it's a real role though, right?
00:30:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like this, it's this temporary thing. Well, so like there's the difference between roles and function. And then there's the question, do we organize according to roles or function?
00:30:27 - Dan’s iPhone
I don't think it's function. In my version of the world, it's never going to exist. It existed here because we were going to start selling it to everybody. But in the version that I actually like, I don't want it to be associated with me at all. I mean, I think you could have it here and say, there's someone else wanted to do it, yeah, but I'm not even doing sales, right? me talking to Joe is like me partnering with Joe, right? Right part was the word that I was like, yeah, I had like partner relations Yeah, Joe's gonna sell it, but he's not selling basis really he's telling his his Partnership version of right his sort of Whatever right it's like he's not Really not like if it weren't a pot if someone came along and they weren't a podcaster I would never expect him to talk to them or deal with them at all right if a cold lead came in It's never going Joe.
00:31:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know if it would go to anybody I put it here partner relations today and yeah, I mean that's accurate so then Just get rid of sales Well, I mean part of me thinks I should That's a good idea Yeah How about you make a copy and you keep that and we work on this one
00:32:00 - Dan’s iPhone
I'm going to make a copy and work a couple.
00:32:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Then I need the copy shared.
00:32:07 - Dan’s iPhone
Please. I know these people aren't. Maybe it's in a shared folder. Poop, poop, poop, poop.
00:33:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I got my new food service started and I love it but yesterday I was supposed to get a delivery and I got held up and I'm like, oh, I just put myself in a situation that I really don't like. I'm expecting something I want and I can't have it. I don't like that. But it has already been opening my eyes to like other options and things that can get that are clean that are at the grocery store that are pre made. Not a few but some brands that I didn't know about. But it's been really nice having variety and healthy food like there's like this cauliflower and we need to know about super good. My daughter's like, I almost. I up in my mouth. I liked it.
00:34:06 - Dan’s iPhone
What if I put my own on?
00:34:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dude, oh, there it is. There's the dog. Okay. Okay. in this one, we could either just disconnect sales or just get rid of it. But I think we should make it according to what we're doing now and just get rid of it. They can always be added back in.
00:34:31 - Dan’s iPhone
Well, I'm gonna leave it because I have no idea how to edit this. So removing is easy. Like I don't want to know who made this.
00:34:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I guess it was me. Yeah, I think we did it together because I remember this. Let's see. Define, join, change, rotate, ungroup. I'm gonna do this and then see if I can undo it.
00:34:58 - Dan’s iPhone
I don't know if that wasn't it. Well, well, well, well, great thing is a nice show.
00:35:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I do.
00:35:07 - Dan’s iPhone
Can't hide.
00:35:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, no. Just like. Oh, look what I did.
00:35:26 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah. That works. like.
00:35:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay, you don't exist right now.
00:35:46 - Dan’s iPhone
Is there any.
00:35:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can we drag over? But at least we know like we can tell just by that that it's not something we're doing right now. Okay, so David, all of that stuff. Same thing. Can we just get rid of that part?
00:36:00 - Dan’s iPhone
Well, no, I mean that there's some validity to that. I think what is the new represent so we have partners migration. Oh, new sites.
00:36:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then maintenance, but David's not the dude.
00:36:18 - Dan’s iPhone
And there's no dude really.
00:36:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, would you not call that so like what happens is you tell Greg to go design something. I mean, so far there hasn't even been like a new new site, right?
00:36:39 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, probably would be with the podcasting building one right now, but it's not for basis. So has there been a new new site that is not JB? And then I mean the podcasting isn't everything. But it would go under partners though, right?
00:37:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I think it would be new sites, but under partners.
00:37:13 - Dan’s iPhone
I mean, there's things like literally yesterday was thinking, what if it's only ever that, right? So I'm like, I should position it to start as that it's the solution for podcasting, period. And then later on adding these other things if it ever comes to that. So it's like shouldn't the messaging be, hey, I know that we made this full podcast. That's all we do, even though it's not the plan, but that's the current plan. Maybe the current plan is the plan. So in that regard, then there's just production and no partners, there is maintenance. There.
00:37:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean. Open. you do this you're going to be doing something similar with mom right so it's not just podcasting like you have at least two legs on this no nothing none of that it's built on none of that gets built on basis oh okay yeah that's all it gets built on high level and bampoli which is a totally different org guard yeah which i need to make a note for that that we want to have a org chart for that for mom um okay well so the org chart should be based off of what we're doing now and what we're working on now and even you know with the conversation once now through the end of the year i don't see you going just knowing the pace that you work at unless something presents itself but even still it would only be in the beginning of like let's talk it out there mazes. So we can make this around podcasting. So there's the functionality of the current thing. So there's partners because you have, what's his face, binaural beats. Jodi, I can't say Cody, but I'm like, it's not Cody. Um, Jodi, and strong marriage now. Empire.
00:39:36 - Dan’s iPhone
No empires in that part.
00:39:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, Jodi and strong marriage now, then, and Wolfar, which probably is maybe going away, but.
00:39:51 - Dan’s iPhone
Well, I mean, in that part, you know, my plan is, are there going to be any future partners? No. Right. So it's like, partners even goes away.
00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if this is that it doesn't because it's still like this like unless you're planning on getting rid of all those it still needs to be done right now they're just maintenance there there's you know I mean there's no stand alone so then you're just looking at like this yeah I still think that there should be something specified between in-house like I guess it's under development and this all should so production is it even production or is it under develops the dev ops the maintenance production Do you got an I in there? Is that not Avishak and Vijay in there too?
00:41:25 - Dan’s iPhone
It's really these guys.
00:41:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's like I'm just going to call them repressed because so what is these guys these three Eric have a check oh oh you're not looking at zoom I'm looking at it in the actual document so when you said these guys I was like what are you talking about okay so that team right so they're like a like a team yeah um there no I can have it so
00:42:00 - Dan’s iPhone
But I said, I was like, this is your stuff. Bye.
00:43:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You You don't have anybody for that?
00:43:15 - Dan’s iPhone
They don't currently exist, but like a future role, particularly.
00:43:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How future?
00:43:29 - Dan’s iPhone
So right now it's just Noriel, so I mean, I guess it's Noriel really right now. It depends, it depends, it depends if we need it. Right now we don't necessarily need them.
00:43:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So why would you put that there and not the, you know, future or, you know, down the side at the bottom or something?
00:44:00 - Dan’s iPhone
under Noreo. So I did like what Noreo and I discussed was all right you're what if we just move you to being the code over Lord therefore he would be over some level of larval developer but right now he's occupying that role so okay about hey if I reduce what I pay you and we bring in junior dev to do that that's that's where we're at so the person exists by the end of the year okay it can see me everything there should be no TBD like that should be separate let's not do that language okay sorry right so that role exists there we do have a larval dev so while I'm looking at underneath bobby um in the project management and you've got css pine and you don't even use pine grow anymore do you we're I'm still up here we gotta get our way down there
00:45:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, okay, okay. I'll calm myself.
00:45:03 - Dan’s iPhone
Yes, that doesn't even exist then Because the blocks right right Oh Yeah, I forgot about that CC. Right.
00:45:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So like teach day You Okay.
00:46:31 - Dan’s iPhone
I know, I'm like, I can't even see those numbers.
00:46:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So where does give a fit in this? doesn't really, or doesn't do something. No.
00:46:47 - Dan’s iPhone
No. He's just like a floating. It would be like, he's like an upward person, right? They don't have a permanent. It's a if and when kind of thing. It's like I'm floating out, don't even know, like it's none of these.
00:47:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who is responsible for managing any like temporary contract tech people?
00:47:12 - Dan’s iPhone
No, he doesn't manage anybody.
00:47:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I'm asking you who me. Yeah.
00:47:22 - Dan’s iPhone
And they're, you know, are you not part of the dev ops team though, also? No. I have no idea what's going on there right now. Like illustrated earlier. So like I hear about it, but I'm not intimately involved. I'm hit right. I basically try to get into him and to him. To Noria or Eric. I don't really ever talk to Avish. I can DJ unless they ask me stuff directly, which happens here and there. Or Stacy will tell me they asked me something, which happens more frequently. the other? Did you answer their question? What question? They asked your question.
00:48:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay. Well, I just think like just the hiring and the giving the jobs and who does what you do that and it's not represented here.
00:48:25 - Dan’s iPhone
I think there's not even the same. Well, it's not because I hire people on a lark for like random that I do, right? when I hire somebody to do a straight, I mean it's whatever.
00:48:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it kind of falls under ideas.
00:48:47 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, it's so infrequent. It's not frequent or there's no level of permanence to it. These that grow up permanent, although even
00:49:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so let's get down to production then.
00:49:13 - Dan’s iPhone
Who singing? This is. Traverse.
00:49:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I thought somebody in the office was singing because I can't really like hear music. It sounded just like somebody in the background singing without music.
00:49:41 - Dan’s iPhone
There is the music. It's a lie about.
00:49:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So. And Eric takes over like any new projects, right, he's like in charge of them? No.
00:50:23 - Dan’s iPhone
No. Okay. So it's, I mean, again, this is where you'd say it's like the WordPress team, but it's not even, it's, that's the thing, right, I don't even know that there's really no dev in production. It's done over here and then given to production.
00:50:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so define the process. What happens when you're like, we need a new site, or we need to migrate site.
00:51:00 - Dan’s iPhone
whatever. It gets Stacy's sense of damage. That's it. Okay, so like Bobby doesn't know Eric doesn't get the introduction Stacy, not Bobby. Right, that's what I'm saying. Like Bobby's definitely not down here.
00:51:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And then would you not maybe just drag that up and then like take the lines over to WordPress instead of things underneath it.
00:51:48 - Dan’s iPhone
Well, so over here there this is where they do dev outside of like for product not as part of production like so let's say that these guys I'm trying to think of it like them doing this whole block thing like it has nothing to do with production.
00:52:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's part of WordPress, so it's like production is just like, I get that, I get that, which is why I'm saying production is its own block, but it links to those people that already exist on the org chart rather than duplicating them on the org chart.
00:52:30 - Dan’s iPhone
But no, right? So yeah, mean it would go to these two guys, so you could definitely do that.
00:52:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And those two guys are still serving the same overall skill set function in the business. It may be a different department that calls on them, but I think, so I always think in terms of simplest, right? Rather than have a whole bunch of blocks and positions and seats, whatever, sometimes we have, I mean, whatever, they are the WordPress people and they're, they're used for internal and, and other projects. I just, I just don't think that any name should be repeated more than once if we can find a way to organize the structure that really shows what it actually looks like and I don't know how else to explain it. I'm bringing us not doing that well, but I don't, I think that we should try to, I think the simplest format is one where one person's name only shows up once and everything that's attached to them is attached to them.
00:53:46 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah. Yeah.
00:53:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because that's more accurate like we, it's a lean team. If we can, I think having the ability to visualize its simplicity, as it is, will help us as we're looking at growth, but also as you look at other projects that you're maybe influencing, or even just like, like David, you know, if you're having a conversation about how simple things are, and go like, look at this, this is my team. Look at everything that we do. You know, you've got another 71, which is a different org chart, it's a small, but it's still a small team, and it's still, you know, almost a $4 million.
00:54:44 - Dan’s iPhone
Is it? don't know where it's at Okay.
00:55:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you know that that's and how you know how many of them are actually full-time Or work full-time Work full-time None Yeah, so Probably. Yeah Anyway, just that's the thing is And the other thing is when it starts to get too big and too complicated is when implosion happens and that's relative Impertinent and important information for somebody like David because he tends to Just go to horizontal And David who go ahead and I'm just saying you have a habit, like people ask you for advice and sometimes that leads to new partnerships, but either way, if you have a visual way to represent how simple your step is, number one, I think we've run it better, I think you are better, you know, help other people that you just, you just do it anyway, but now you've got a visual tool. Well, I don't think we have enough visual representations. I don't think there's enough documented for any of our stuff, and especially in its simplest form, and I think that that's something that I think it's a lever that's been neglected and definitely because I haven't been helping it the way I should. Wow, you are first key today. Remember that the commercial for Frisky food for the cats, they were just pouncing on everything. I'm like playing with balls. That was the assignment today, Dan. But please put Greg in design because it's driving me next that it's TBD this long.
00:57:42 - Dan’s iPhone
I already did that.
00:57:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's weird.
00:57:45 - Dan’s iPhone
It was because he was in a different block. No, I just moved this block.
00:57:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't see Greg show up.
00:57:53 - Dan’s iPhone
There we go. I mean, here's the thing, right? It's like, do you even separate production? I mean, I guess we could do. Oh, I gotta go backwards now. I can use myself.
00:58:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's worth the effort. I can almost guarantee them. Can't, because it may not be this way, but you going through this, you'll just be driving along and have another epiphany because you saw something that you didn't really notice, you saw. Every time we do a visual exercise, something comes out of it that wasn't anticipated.
00:58:50 - Dan’s iPhone
That's pretty, this is pretty much it. Because Greg Design exists outside of production, technically. sometimes he designs stuff. that has nothing to do with production, right? it'll be doing logo, it has nothing to do with the thing being built. So like, I think you're still producing it. Yeah, but it never touches these guys, never touch it. They never see it as nothing to do with anything down there. So it's like, before me or like, so right now he's doing a graphic for fan flowy, right? Which is, I mean, that's not even on here, right? Well, it is the site's being decided and well, it's just four. It's like part of would you put it under maintenance? No.
00:59:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Even if it's just straight under production, it's under production. It would stay to not send Greg information?
01:00:02 - Dan’s iPhone
No, it goes straight from you every time. Like 99% of the time.
01:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I still think it's under production of some sort. It doesn't, I don't think it goes straight under operations. Or you change it to, it's not production, it's a website or something or website specific production that Stacey is over.
01:00:52 - Dan’s iPhone
Well, that we don't design is not just websites, right? I know that's what I'm saying.
01:00:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Is that website? Site production is one thing and design is another thing and design goes under, you know, like it's attached with like finance, DevOps, legal, all that, it's its own department and then website production is its own department and design gets linked the same way that WordPress would get linked under website production and DevOps.
01:01:30 - Dan’s iPhone
It's to, it's a trick, to make an elbow. It sounds familiar but I'm not getting a visual.
01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, there's a wait.
01:02:01 - Dan’s iPhone
Wasn't an epic?
01:02:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
think it was an epic. Anyway, there's one of these, uh, it's either that or Arthur and the Visibles, but I think it was an epic. And there's this dad that gets, his daughter gets shrunk down. And so he's giant and he's hurts his elbow and like he says it like really slow, but she's tiny and he's huge and my kids for years and years and years, is randomly will just, if somebody says elbow, at least just like reenact that whole thing.
01:02:39 - Dan’s iPhone
It's a thing getting bigger.
01:02:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, your, um, chart? Yeah, because I think it's, it's fixed and maybe you have to like zoom out. But just drag it, drag those things up.
01:03:02 - Dan’s iPhone
Did you do that?
01:03:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I did that. The lines didn't follow. If I try to drag the bottom ones down. Oh, I know. Like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Yeah.
01:03:53 - Dan’s iPhone
I think Greg disappeared again. And and What if you put
01:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know. I'm thinking about like production being to the right of DevOps and then that is Stacey.
01:05:18 - Dan’s iPhone
DevOps, they're developing like, for instance, basis itself. No, if they're developing something for fan flowy, if they're developing something for perfect wedding timeline, like those things have nothing to do with WordPress. Like Stacey has not worked on perfect wedding timeline ever.
01:05:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not what I'm talking about. So I got to get through all of this to see what I'm talking about. But goes straight underneath you as the visionary and under, I mean, they're Stacey anyway, as liaison, which I don't think, I mean, don't know if she's like, maybe they're co integrators.
01:06:18 - Dan’s iPhone
He doesn't ever, she doesn't do anything with like rocks or running the meetings or like he does all that stuff. I mean, the liaison thing isn't even going to exist anymore because if I get rid of all these partners, that's like, who's there to leave his with?
01:06:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Get rid of all these partners. So like, are you not going to do strong marriage now and vinyl beats and all that stuff?
01:06:45 - Dan’s iPhone
So there's no one to talk to a strong marriage now. There's no one to talk to with vinyl beats. Like in my version of the world, like I just pay those people. Like, I don't talk to the strong marriage now people in years.
01:06:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you pay them?
01:07:00 - Dan’s iPhone
their rip So they get their rip their their profit share But I don't talk to them.
01:07:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh You pay them because the money comes into your account, and then they get their their portion.
01:07:16 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah Look So that's The partner thing is old right Glenn's gone wolf or like That's I think that's gonna be gone Does Bobby give Stacy instruction about how to do her job and what to do On a regular basis now More often than not No So so this is my thing is I don't think we're pretty like do we prioritize the hierarchy of Tasks or people
01:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
people. And I think it should be tasks or people because it's an accountability chart.
01:08:09 - Dan’s iPhone
Okay.
01:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I think that and that's where my brain has been going with this is who's accountable to who for what. But primarily, first it's who's accountable to who for what is secondary.
01:08:27 - Dan’s iPhone
So you forget it, but you have to separate the people from the role, right? Ultimately, the integrator like these people are accountable to the integrator before me, right? like Bobing talks to Abhishek and BJ once a week. I've never spoken to that and literally I've never spoken. So they're being accountable to the integrator.
01:08:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's making sure that she doesn't talk to them to know. Is Stacy accountable to Bobby?
01:09:03 - Dan’s iPhone
Me, she is, but they don't really communicate very well.
01:09:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But is she accountable to him and he not accountable to her?
01:09:12 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah.
01:09:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay then. So I'm thinking that Stacy's line is on the same line as finance operations legal and DevOps.
01:09:25 - Dan’s iPhone
Which, but what line is that? What is that role?
01:09:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so, okay, so the role in the people, this is my issue with these systems, is that you have to choose what matters most because sometimes they don't agree with each other and they don't reconcile. And I think that it's more important that it be the people and the accountability in world. then the seat first in a very small team what I'm you're saying this block up here this thing yes I'm saying that doesn't exist okay then get rid of that yeah I don't think that exists okay so then the next thing is um I think production is on the same line also as finance as operations legal dev ops I don't think operations exist I mean look at it the only thing attached to it is production so then just put that into production move Stacey there and get rid of the operations block right because these are the same yeah yeah I mean that's as it exists right now I'm trying to hold on be still one tick actually I gotta run to the back.
01:11:21 - Dan’s iPhone
Okay, I play with this then Okay, I'm ahead look You I'm just go I can of I'm go ahead and see if I can Hi.
01:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I it. I did not break it.
01:13:02 - Dan’s iPhone
Oh. I'm dead. Now it's ruined.
01:13:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not ruined.
01:13:10 - Dan’s iPhone
Yes.
01:13:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, what I'm wondering is. Okay. So production is websites. There's nothing else right.
01:13:22 - Dan’s iPhone
So is that not redundant? Um, well, the problem is. Design is not a website, right? So design has to go down there. Design is not always websites.
01:13:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. um, what I'm saying is like there's production and then design comes off of that and then new maintenance, whatever. I don't think we need to have a thing that says websites because that's what it is. Period.
01:13:50 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, but new and maintenance. Well, new and maintenance are new website maintenance website, but I'm just saying the block website goes away. Right. Right. Right. I'm going to it, technically.
01:14:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, like, new site. Right. And then what I would, I would want to see is like a line. Well, he's not a fan, nevermind. And do what I did. Okay. Does Norio ever use Abhishek and Vijay? Does Eric use them under DevOps?
01:15:15 - Dan’s iPhone
I mean occasionally.
01:15:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and also so under maintenance site, would you put Eric there?
01:15:28 - Dan’s iPhone
No, he pretty much never does.
01:15:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And new sites like who does that?
01:15:37 - Dan’s iPhone
So primarily that gets issued to Abhishek and then Vijay. Those two are like one guy. It's like they're like a duo. I don't even know who does what. I just know Abhishek's more of the PM of their thing, right? Abhishek's very organized. Yeah, yeah, I think they have. I mean, the other thing is you could get rid of Abhishek and Vijay and just call them one thing. Yes. Whatever their company is, the camera and the name of it. Yeah. You could do that because I think they also have a guy that we never interacted, but that they take the work done too.
01:16:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I think that's the thing to do. New site and maintenance site gets to be their agency, whatever it is, and we can put like a little note off to the side that agency is defined by Abhishek, Vijay plus whoever.
01:16:40 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah. So then I mean, yeah, can't put it over under here because Stacy never taught us the story of it. No more.
01:17:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there a spot for Munir on here or is he just like?
01:17:35 - Dan’s iPhone
He's just temporary.
01:17:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Consider like in the idea realm because you talk to him and that's not a permanent situation.
01:17:44 - Dan’s iPhone
You like yeah he's just temporary it's like it's a it's not permanent and it'll never be.
01:17:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, what's the difference between new site maintenance and word press development?
01:18:25 - Dan’s iPhone
Level of development. Or Eric is?
01:18:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Right now where you're at. In the production.
01:18:37 - Dan’s iPhone
Like. Yeah, it doesn't really exist.
01:18:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I'm thinking.
01:18:46 - Dan’s iPhone
Not here. Yeah. Yeah, now you're just like.
01:18:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if you can't remember that company name, which
01:19:00 - Dan’s iPhone
If you just go ab slash beach. Well, we literally call them and there you go.
01:19:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that works.
01:19:19 - Dan’s iPhone
Work. Scrap. Ah, what is it doing? Pretty great. Oh, come on. You
01:20:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How and why did the yeah, okay OK, I was like, where does this come from? All right, this seems more accurate for what we have, and also what we'll need going forward, even with podcasting and stuff like that. Like, I'm just thinking of my mind. Do we have kind of a side chart over here of what goes under what, like, what in terms of, like, the maintenance? So we just kind of have a list for an example of, like, maybe a reference point. In my mind, I'm just thinking, like, what's the list of the maintenance projects? Like the paths or? No, no, and this wouldn't be part of the accountability chart, but it's kind of my, like, the next step. And how have we already been here now? for half, but okay. Anyway, it went fast for me. But this is good. But what I would want to do, so the next step to me of the conversation, not to me, this is accomplished, and I think it's good. But the next conversation I would want to have is, okay, what are we working on right now? are those stages? kind of plotting out where you want to go for the rest of fluid in terms of the conversations with Joe, like I think it's a very fluid pace, a loose pace. But I do think that there's some identifiable potential targets, emphasis on potential, right, because there's no contract, there's no anything. But I think that our experience, especially with people like Joe, meaning Joe is a one that is more guided than guided. thing. And if there's something to be done, you're the one or, or, but what he's got Heather, though, you know, that, that puts the framework and the outline of what is going to happen up. And I think that that's a conversation to be had and something to be working on for the rest of the year. In terms of like, what is the evolution of basis? That seems to be where the conversation goes most. Come in. Hold on one sec. Okay. Like we're wrapping up right now. Just a couple minutes. Okay. So that's where I would like to be talking about things and discussing next week and just kind of at where is basis going. Again, you know, there is a pace and a rhythm to it, which is pretty relaxed. But for it to get potential and to be able to keep traction in the best way that it can without being forceful and rigid, I think that's the conversation to have is to just kind of break down, okay, what could be happening, what are we going to be working on moving in specifics in terms of a project with Joe or anything else?
01:24:32 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, got to.
01:24:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This looks crazy different. you should go do a before and after like all the blocks we had.
01:24:42 - Dan’s iPhone
There go.
01:24:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dude, yes. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, nine, 10, 11, 12 blocks compared to one account. That's at least cut in half.
01:24:53 - Dan’s iPhone
But I feel like it's cut by like 65 way more.
01:25:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's good. That's good. All right, well, my brain wants to go ask a bunch of other questions, but my mom do these any minute.
01:25:13 - Dan’s iPhone
So my next meeting is going to walk in the door.
01:25:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, then I release you.
01:25:20 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, they're texting me right now. I'm like, I'm not going to answer this text.
01:25:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

Hello.
00:00:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, how are you?
00:00:04 - Michael’s iPhone
Good, well.
00:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
are you? Good. How's the babies and the family?
00:00:10 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, it's exhausting. I forgot. I forgot how tired you could go, but I can't complain to you. You are Esther. You guys are the ones actually doing it.
00:00:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, it is a family thing that whole, it's not just a women thing, although we definitely definitely got a lot to do.
00:00:30 - Michael’s iPhone
I'm pretty sure you guys do the bulk of it.
00:00:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, I just saying it's not just stuff.
00:00:37 - Michael’s iPhone
I will agree with you, that it's all right.
00:00:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My power, power went out and all my stuff. Yeah, I had to reset everything and like log back in and load my browser windows and all of that.
00:00:53 - Michael’s iPhone
So that almost never happens.
00:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that was fun. So I'm just, I'm a little disoriented.
00:01:00 - Michael’s iPhone
to the one getting everything back up uh Mark said he hoped you got your GT4 yeah we yeah yeah it should be coming on Thursday oh okay um let's have you what's the progress on assistance or chef or anything like that oh so we found uh we found a home assistant personal it's like a task person and also to watch Mari so she's gonna come Monday through Friday from 8 to 12 or 7 30 to 12 and what we believe is that'll help us return Amazon stuff do shopping at Whole Foods our weekly uh returning things dropping you know is to UPS to kind of the tasks and then also when Esther's super tired we're gonna give her Mari for the morning and then she'll bottle feed Mari for the 8 o'clock and the 11 o'clock feeds and then let Esther sleep in or just do whatever she needs to do and then at 12 o'clock Esther will take over as usual for the rest of the day and yeah and then I usually come back and finish work about five so I'll take over or help out at five so we're gonna start there I love that plan my stinking AI note taker is also not letting me highlight so I just want to make sure I get that so 12 o'clock to noon um yeah we're gonna do it above board too you know a lot of them we want to just cash and I you know I'm in position where I don't really feel like I want to do that and risk that so we're just gonna do it above board we're paying her 35 an hour which is a premium but yes but then uh then we could do it above board pair, like a normal W2, like legally, we're supposed to, and then be done with it. Because yeah, I think I could find a cheaper person, like 25 30, but they all wanted cash. And I was like, I don't want to risk that, you get hurt, and then you sue me. Yes.
00:03:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But also, it doesn't, I, have you considered 1099 instead of W2?
00:03:21 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, we looked at, I actually, we have an employment lawyer, and we talked about it. But if they're coming to my house, it's pretty much W2. Unless they're doing tasks like cooking, specific cleaning, but if it's like, every morning, eight to 12, like on a schedule, and it's, uh, it's tough.
00:03:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, the schedule.
00:03:39 - Michael’s iPhone
It's only, it's, it's excuse us that that becomes an issue. But I was just like, I don't even want to, don't want to go in that. Yeah.
00:03:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And are you hiring her as an LLC or like a corporation?
00:03:54 - Michael’s iPhone
That's kind of a personal corporation. It's weird. Like, yeah, I set it up through Poppins payroll, so they specialize in
00:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
housekeeper payroll well what I'm asking is like are you using the are you minimizing liability as much as possible in your corporate structure no is that something that you consider maybe wanting to do that's a good point you mean like corporation hire yeah I mean even just an LLC is still you don't have to deal with unemployment you don't have to deal with any of that stuff although if you're doing W2 that's probably financially the best way to organize it in terms of protection from getting sued especially if that corporation solely exists for home operations type stuff rather than you know any of your other business so that its assets are minimized the her ability to sue you is minimized But also, you have to pay unemployment with W2. You have to do all of those things anyway. So an S-Corp really isn't gonna add any more burden, but it should give you some more protection. And also, there are things that you can do to protect your money and an S-Corp that you can't do and other things like hiring the kids, paying that type of stuff.
00:05:23 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, we already passed through one of the Corps. So yeah, actually, maybe if we made it sort of like an executive bonus. I'm gonna look into my accountant. Actually, that's a really good point. Maybe if we put another layer of liability besides just the work of insurance.
00:05:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thanks, y'all, look at that. Every week, I'm gonna look for a way to be valuable.
00:05:44 - Michael’s iPhone
We'll try. I hadn't even thought of it. Yeah, because what I had talked to my accountant was like, hey, can I use business expenses to pay for this? And they're like, no, that's sketchy, like, don't do that. But if we're doing it for liability, we're essentially, we're giving the childcare, you know, as a executive perk to me and Esther. Yeah, but not trying to claim a tax deduction. I think that would be in just for essentially liability.
00:06:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, let me ask. That's great. Thanks. And also that, to the point of the type of people that you want to have in your life, having somebody who is good at wealth management and wealth advice, there's a big difference between accounting and wealth management. So the difference between multi-millionaires and billionaires think very, very differently. So anyway, something to keep in mind. All right, let's write that down. Okay, so 12th noon, you rattled off the task from me really quick.
00:06:42 - Michael’s iPhone
I would really like them one more time if you don't mind. Yeah, so she's going to work from 8 or 7.30 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. So the biggest things is like the weekly or by week or twice a week grocery shopping, returning Amazon things to Whole Foods or UPS stores. dropping off packages we want to send to UPS, USGS, or FedEx, and doing just random, you know, we need diapers, please go to Target, you know, stuff that we can't easily order online. So those are like the tasks. And then, under that house cleaning, she's going to do, we're going to have the housekeeper continue coming every other week. But she's going to do maintenance of the dishes in the kitchen, which is what Ester and I were driving us crazy. So she's going to do the dishes in the kitchen. She's going to help us with the laundry. I want to say my laundry because I have more than Ester and, you know, washing and folding my laundry and, you know, a light bathroom cleaning around mostly the toilets. And then, as a backup, if Ester's tired, she's going to have bottle seed Mari for the morning and just focus on Mari for the morning.
00:07:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. how did you find her?
00:07:59 - Michael’s iPhone
do you know about that? The value is like let's just explore that conversation a little bit so I'm familiar with it. Yeah, so I just started asking my neighbors, hey, you know, we're looking for a housekeeper, do you guys know anything? And then this lady actually came to our attention because she babysits our next next door neighbors to kids. She's been doing it for five years. And now they're both going to school in the morning, so she has no work in the morning. So they said, hey, you know, it'd be perfect if you guys took her in the morning and then, you know, obviously we'll do like normally act. so we had to talk with her Esther and then me and then also my my mom, my grandma was very skeptical. So we all talked to her and then we're actually going to talk to the my neighbor today little later today. going get on the call and just kind of bet her a little more. But yeah, that's that was kind of a process.
00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it hasn't started yet, but you're you're right there making that decision.
00:08:59 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, September 1st is when. And the kids at school starts when she'll have time to start with us permanently.
00:09:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's a very good day. That's the day Tina was born.
00:09:07 - Michael’s iPhone
So I put good blessing. Nine one in 1991, right?
00:09:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nineteen seventy six year of the dragon.
00:09:16 - Michael’s iPhone
I have no shame.
00:09:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I earned every strike. Every strike. Um, OK, so how will she roughly?
00:09:28 - Michael’s iPhone
Does she have kids? She's two kids there in Guatemala. They're fully grown. Actually, I'm sorry, they're in San Diego. They've brought their families from Guatemala. Her kids are in San Diego.
00:09:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so how old are the kids that she was babysitting?
00:09:49 - Michael’s iPhone
Four and six, I believe now. Four and seven, something like that.
00:09:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And what kind of family are your neighbors?
00:10:00 - Michael’s iPhone
Two lawyers, they're two stay at home lawyers.
00:10:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so the reason I'm asking is because it speaks to level of expectations. You know what I mean? If people in certain industries, you already know there's going to be a certain level of competence required, ability to communicate, ability to work autonomously. Generally speaking, higher level professions have low tolerance for stupid mistakes, especially on repeat. True. Right, so if they're both attorneys, even if they're not the most high-performing, there's a certain amount of effort you have to do just to get through a law school and medical school, right? So the odds that she's highly incompetent, or you know what I mean? Just because somebody refers you, somebody doesn't mean it's a good referral, but similar ages, similar neighborhood, which is going to be similar of a sort, income levels. You know what I mean?
00:11:01 - Michael’s iPhone
There's so many things that go into that So that's super hopeful and I'd like We've actually seen her at like the park with the two kids before like I've seen her multiple times that like the parks and Yeah, so every time I've seen her like she's not on the phone. She's not like texting, know She's always like watching the kids.
00:11:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that Yeah, that was a big thing too.
00:11:26 - Michael’s iPhone
We we had seen her. I so that's why we're gonna talk to the lawyer the owner today because We don't know how she's you know in the house Seen her in the house. I've only seen her in the park. Um, yeah, and what you have nanny cams We we thought about that we haven't Because mostly because estu is gonna be in the house kind of like the lawyers work Um, but yeah, we're thinking of that Well, um most of the services have apps and you can have sketch
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
tools where you can turn things on and off. So privacy mode, like if you only want it to be on during the hours that she's there, do a little research first and find something that you can just schedule beyond during this time. If you don't want the footage, you can save it to a cloud or an SD card so that it's not in the cloud and your privacy is your privacy, that type of but, you know, when it comes to your children, safety, things like that, something to consider. Also liability, if anything ever happens, you've got evidence and nobody wants to be that person, nobody wants to think about that, but after the fact is too late. Also, we all tend to be on better behavior when we know we're being watched and it doesn't matter or cause an effect, chicken and egg, it doesn't matter. Whatever draws us out to be better people draws us out to be better people.
00:12:54 - Michael’s iPhone
So it's like the switch, it's like switch, the housekeeper to know, like make it easier for her. to be on her best behavior, right? Like, that's what the book talked about is like, yeah, like, who knows if it's forcing her or it's like, you know, whatever, it doesn't matter. Like, the end result is she's going to be a little bit better because she is being watched. Like, yeah, I like that.
00:13:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ah, look at that. We're applying switch.
00:13:20 - Michael’s iPhone
I like your book. I'm going to read that book. Like you said, it's short. I think I'm going to, I will read it four times because it's just a very, like, basic, easy to understand, like, makes sense concepts. And, yeah, I'm going to read it four because it's anecdotal, the stories pop out in your head.
00:13:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, that's the thing that's been amazing to me. I only read it once. I should go back and reread it. But I, the details of the stories that pop in my head and how frequently they do, I reference it probably several times a year. There's only a few books that I do that, which you would think it'd be more than that. But I can't say that about most books or anything that I've read. a single source that has multiple applications and that's one of them so that's why I don't recommend a ton of books but I gave one a mark today also that I haven't read for like 12 years probably called EMIF and that would be good for you to read as well I just think it's a good overall business book but it is about structure I have read that I think I have read that book it has like a really a lot of words on the cover it's like the EMIF yeah I read that I don't remember what the premise was it was about sales it was more about how many structure and maturity and menu items so for example you can't go to McDonald's and order a filet mignon because even if they wanted to go to the store get it for you and you said you were going to pay him $200 to do they're not going to be good at it you don't know what you're going to get because that's not what they do over and over again, but they want to be the best at what they have. So these are the limited items yet. Right.
00:15:08 - Michael’s iPhone
Was it even mastery or something?
00:15:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Revisited.
00:15:12 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. Yeah. haven't read that. Yeah. That's what it was.
00:15:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Even if revisited. Okay.
00:15:17 - Michael’s iPhone
That's great. I'll pick that up and get it on book on tape. I do remember I liked it a lot. I don't remember. Yeah.
00:15:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then also talk about IBM. I think that was e-book, Emeth and they talk about org charts and that IBM was kind of unique in that it was born as a mature company. So it talks about companies from teens or like newborn stages and then beginner right and then teenage and then a mature company. And a mature company has SOPs has an org chart. It has all of these things, very specific functions, very specific seats and roles that perform each of those functions. functions and that type of thing. And it has been so long, so I have to go back and ask myself what I will.
00:16:05 - Michael’s iPhone
I will already totally read it.
00:16:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, it's okay. You don't have to do I do. I need to because because it is one of those ones that I it's a it's a staple. There are certain staples that that I like to reference. And it's because they're foundational concepts like switch those concepts. You can use them for almost every type of decision that you have to make that is high impact, right? Who you hire, how you hire, how you choose your how much time you're going to work, where you're going to work, that type of thing. Because it gives you a structural concept framework to run your decisions through. So switch does that.
00:16:59 - Michael’s iPhone
And think no, no, I'll really. For sure, I do remember it.
00:17:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, okay, okay, so I'm excited.
00:17:05 - Michael’s iPhone
I forgot Yay, I love it. I love it when people are excited and they when I read over and over it is Peter Teal is zero to one It's about like starting a new business or thinking about like a product that you want off That's the one I've read like price five times now That's the one but but it has like the same thing like you're saying and like switch very simple concepts Like things like a checklist to go through in my mind. Like is this even a good idea, you know, so okay?
00:17:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'll do that. I love that love that Okay, so we're starting off with an assistant and she is going to tackle dishes every day Yeah, through Friday Right. Well, that's what I meant.
00:17:49 - Michael’s iPhone
Sorry Monday through Friday The hard thing that Esther and I talked about is like Esther doesn't like leaving the kitchen dirty at night And so we're trying to like she thinks she would be okay and we're trying it for like a week because it's just very foreign to her like you've stuck in the kitchen sink overnight so yeah but she has just very skill like but I think yes just come around she's like let me try it you know we'll try it for two weeks see if I could like handle that she doesn't like going to sleep with the kitchen and mess I mean I get it but you know if you know help is coming in the morning that I feel like maybe we can try it and see and something that you can help her with this is is it because you know that in the morning you're gonna have to face that duty and you don't want to start your day thinking with that that is on your on your plate so it isn't that there are dishes in the sink it's that there are dishes in the sink that you have to deal with first thing in the morning or look at all day so if you because yeah no I actually talked to her but I did I asked her the question it was because in childhood she would get that she didn't have a great childhood she who would get yelled at if things weren't aligned. So now she makes sure things are aligned. That's the reason. And she even said, I get it. That's my reasoning. But it's hard to break that and go to sleep with that purpose.
00:19:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For that purpose, maybe ask her to commit to just 30 days. 30 days, draw how she feels progressively. But here's the thing. Our decisions should feed our values because of our priorities. Our priorities are from our values, not someone else's. And so the way to loosen ourselves from the past is to break the responses that we have as a result of them. So if it was really Esther's vow. use rather than a fear response. Um, that wouldn't have been what she said.
00:20:06 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. So she's still she's still making it about a fear response rather than about her own.
00:20:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is to not give it any power anymore.
00:20:18 - Michael’s iPhone
So I like to practice taking the power away from dishes shouldn't have that power over her. That's right. I like that.
00:20:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She needs your coaching. I'm here. Um, but we can do this. But this is, this is why I talk about the holistic approach stuff. Because yeah, she can help her.
00:20:41 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah. If she could make that like if I could just put like a little bit of a carrot and be like, Hey, why don't you focus on your values? What do you want? Do you want the dishes to hold that power of fear over you? And if I could just get her just a little switch try it for 30 days, then it'll make our lives better at night. could focus on the kids at night instead of, you know, washing dishes.
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
for 45 minutes.
00:21:01 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, you know, we might cook more right because you don't cook because we're so afraid of all the plate, you know, the pots and pans, so like that might be better. So yeah, I love this. I'll give her just that little nugget and see if she'll try it for 30 days and then see if it makes her feel better.
00:21:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Great. So there's one more additional power in that because if you take that fear that came from the past. And if she's able to, you know, loosen its power, what other things is she's still doing because of childhood wounds? And what other hold can be broken? So because if you learn that you can break a hold, then you learn that you can break all the holes. Okay, yeah. I'll look around.
00:21:52 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah. And she's a wonderful person. Like she actually goes to therapy, she works on the different, you know, she knows she has. as bad things and she works on them and you know she believes that some people don't think they can change but she believes she can change so yeah it's been really good.
00:22:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's amazing but the other thing is our partners see things differently than us and we can't see all the things all the time and you can't do all the things all the time so this is where leverage comes in what are those things that have the greatest amount of power for good or bad so in our business in our lives we want to create the powerful levers but we need to undo the bad lovers the one that if I go to bed and the dishes are in there that I could have a bad night's sleep that I could wake up bad because of dishes now I like a clean house I I the energy my productivity my happiness is very much tied to it but having had four kids and being single and running a business and doing all of those things I had to let certain things go and and I got help, you know, around the house and learned it. But I have to let, I can let things go in the moment. So my overall value of cleanliness has not diminished, but the power that I give it when it's out of alignment for the moment is also diminished, because I'm like, it will be solved. I have a system in place to solve it. I don't need to worry about you. You take no more mental space.
00:23:25 - Michael’s iPhone
So anyway. Yeah, I love that.
00:23:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Astronies you. I'm I'm looking for about two or three more clients to be full, especially as we're going into fall, because I want to be dizzier when my girls, they don't need me as much anymore. They're teenagers like growing up and they're moving out. And I'm like, I need to take care of other people. So if you know somebody, let me know. OK, so we'll get into your sleep stuff. But this is a pivotal thing. Can you guys hire this person?
00:23:56 - Michael’s iPhone
OK, so let me know. think so too. I'm really like, I don't like to hope a whole lot, but like I'm like, man, I think if everything checks out with her background within, you know, the old, the lawyer that I'm going to talk to, and I'm really like, man, this could be great. So, yeah, we'll see. I'll let you know in September.
00:24:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Optimism is powerful.
00:24:17 - Michael’s iPhone
It's powerful. It's good.
00:24:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've learned to be cautiously optimistic, but I used to try to hold back my optimism, because a lot of things wouldn't go the way that I wanted to. But instead, what I've shifted that to is instead of holding the expectation specifically of it will be this way, my expectation is it will be improved and it will be better. Because of the specific thing that I did, or because something else revealed itself along the way, or because I failed at this part and I learned and I'm a step closer to actually doing it right. Either way, I lose. And so there's nothing to not be optimistic about because I'm a step closer.
00:25:00 - Michael’s iPhone
Regardless, I think I think like that almost about everything too optimistic, but yeah, that's how I think of it too Relined Okay, okay, so watching folding that's it.
00:25:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a huge amount of stuff I'm super excited about that because we haven't really gotten to the business stuff yet But we came in with a baby and pending now the big is here now.
00:25:24 - Michael’s iPhone
There's there's tiredness and exhaustion Sorry, I'm in your meeting right now. I know I have a good day.
00:25:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice to see you again All right, anyway, so we always have to take seasons into account.
00:25:38 - Michael’s iPhone
Are you I wasn't gonna go to jujitsu because I was like, oh, I got I had the meeting with Tina And then I was like, no, this is what Tina wanted to like, let's get out and do what I Early Yeah
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yes, yes, that is fantastic. Um, so how has my energy right now?
00:26:06 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, it's been great. I love this port. Oh, it's just so good.
00:26:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, it's just, yeah, I love it. to me about how often you've been going, like, has there been an increase in frequency? Um, just just give me a little more detail.
00:26:21 - Michael’s iPhone
Well, the baby's been tough, but I think, uh, last Monday, I started going, again, I'm trying to go three times a week. So like Monday, Wednesday, Saturday or Monday, Wednesday, Sunday, it's just every week's different. So I've been trying to go at least three times a week. So oh, it's just great. Yeah. Glad we paid for access. This was wonderful. Best $200 I've spent.
00:26:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that you phrased it that way.
00:26:47 - Michael’s iPhone
love that you phrased it that way.
00:26:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
told me to.
00:26:50 - Michael’s iPhone
like that. I know.
00:26:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know. But just because, just because I did that doesn't mean that that stuck in your mind and that because when you say it, you give it your own. on power. It's not because I said it. It's because you bought into it and now it becomes yours.
00:27:05 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, I would pay $50 a class to choke someone out.
00:27:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thanks. I think I need to do it too. I'm just a lot more calm everywhere when I do get a little, you know, rustling out of me. Yes. to that point, hold on, let me make sure I want to write that down. We talked about energy sandwiches a little bit when you've got some stressful things or you've got those like back-to-back meetings and things just jumping down and knocking out some push-ups or something to get attention out.
00:27:42 - Michael’s iPhone
Has that ever come up yet? I've been working so little the last two weeks. I really haven't done much work in general. Tomorrow, would say Monday. start working on Wednesday. So Wednesday will be, I'll be working again. So yeah, I mean, the things that I have got done, like the mission critical stuff, it's not really bothersome to me. It's like 20 minutes here, 20 minutes there, and then I get it done. But I haven't really tried to enter just that one yet.
00:28:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's cool. And really, like I said, I think the foundational piece is, and we have to sleep yet, but we'll get to sleep. But is getting your home situation, like you just entered the new season. It's not just two kids, but it's infant all over again.
00:28:35 - Michael’s iPhone
So yeah, this is very, very very Like our, I could already see like our time is gonna be, well, maybe not so much me actually, but Esther's time's gonna be vastly different. So there's a couple things on her business that I'm gonna probably pick up the slack on a little bit, you know, to help her because, yeah, now this is gonna be, it's gonna be all hands on deck for her for the next six not so. Yep, is what it is.
00:29:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so that I understand where your brain is going, what type of work would you be doing?
00:29:12 - Michael’s iPhone
On the Q and E work.
00:29:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I said, okay, when you say Esther stuff, then you mean in your business?
00:29:19 - Michael’s iPhone
Well, Esther runs her own billing company.
00:29:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She bills for my Q and E work, but we segment it. Got it.
00:29:27 - Michael’s iPhone
And so there's, there are things that I'm totally, I just shut off. I'm just black and white. I'm like, nope, that's, that's the billing company. That's hers and her manager. And I don't think about it at all. Literally, I walk into my Q and E. I interview the guy. I write my report. I send it to them. They take care of the rest. But now I think there are things I'm going to step in that she was doing that I'm just going to pick up a little bit more slack on. And just help out a little part.
00:29:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And before the baby, how many hours a week was as
00:30:00 - Michael’s iPhone
So working in her business roughly for she did she did a meeting on Tuesday, one on Friday, like an hour, maybe hour to a paperwork, but she has a wonderful manager, okay, you know, in the manager, a pretty good premium to be our manager. Basically, take everything off Esther's plate. The thing that Esther still has to do is just little things that are just very ownership related, I think. Okay.
00:30:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the manager can't help you with that type of stuff in for QME?
00:30:35 - Michael’s iPhone
Well, that's, that's what I'm going to, I'm going to help the manager do a little more. But like, I want my wording a certain way. And so that's the part I'm going to step in and like work with the manager instead of Esther and the manager on doing.
00:30:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Watch it.
00:30:59 - Michael’s iPhone
All right. my wording for how you can't advertise what I do legally, but I can say, I've done this, I've done this work, I've done this kind of case, as you could say, the truth. You just can't say, I'm the best, I will, know. So that's the point.
00:31:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One of the things that you could do to just just a thought, and it is just a this, not that document?
00:31:22 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
00:31:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Make that very clear. Okay. Yeah. Because if you give examples, and if you give enough examples so that she can understand this language evokes liability, this one doesn't. This one is a claim.
00:31:40 - Michael’s iPhone
is a statement. You know what I mean?
00:31:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. evidence based, that type of thing. So that's the point.
00:32:00 - Michael’s iPhone
is what helps somebody be able to see the correlation.
00:32:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if she's intelligent enough, if this is not that type of thing, we should be more helpful. Love it. Yeah, that's something simple. And then astronaut can work on that too. I could just talk to Esther about it. And then yeah, I can come up with that.
00:32:17 - Michael’s iPhone
That's great. Yeah. Okay, cool.
00:32:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Again, always leverage.
00:32:22 - Michael’s iPhone
whatever we can do to find some leverage and optimize the little things that you do, then you've got more mental effort for the big things. Big rocks, right? Yep, that makes sense. Okay, let me...
00:32:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so did you start using the Food Journal app yet?
00:32:38 - Michael’s iPhone
Yep, I believe I sent it to you. Tina at Profit.
00:32:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I documented it through Sunday. Okay, hold on a second.
00:32:50 - Michael’s iPhone
And separately, I sent the weekly report to your email.
00:32:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know which one you prefer, but I sent the Dailys and the weekly. You should only have one email from me, I think, but...
00:33:02 - Michael’s iPhone
As Tina, I imported it to Tina at Profit Drivers. that's me.
00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a user report. Okay.
00:33:02 - Michael’s iPhone
Um, all right. Well, that's good. So that's in macros. Let's take a look at this. And then I was shocked. Like, I thought I over eat all the time. Esther thinks I underneath, but I was shocked that like, I'm pretty close to 2000, whatever that limit is that 2000 calories a day.
00:33:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, yeah, but do you know what your BMR is? I don't know what the BMR is. Basic metabolic rate. Like what? No idea.
00:33:29 - Michael’s iPhone
Burn on average per day.
00:33:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they calculated it by your age, height, your weight. I'm not even sure if height is in it, but that's what I put in there.
00:33:40 - Michael’s iPhone
And then that's what they said, like whatever that number is 2000. Okay.
00:33:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what's your, oh, your budget is 2020.
00:33:44 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay.
00:33:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you're not trying to wait a minute. Correct. Okay. I'm trying to.
00:33:50 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. So then that's, that's probably what that is. That's very low.
00:33:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm a hundred and twenty two pounds. So it's a fairly low. That makes sense. Okay. Um, but what is your activity level? Like I would think that you're more active than you would need more calories than that because of Jiu-Jitsu.
00:34:09 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, actually you could see that like on the days that I did Jiu-Jitsu, I actually think I ate more that like I had a snack because I was just like dying.
00:34:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if you're actually under a little bit, but maybe not. So, and sometimes it comes down to macros and digestion and body energy, whatever. the whole, the whole point of it is just getting some more and I shouldn't end just seeing. So let me look at that.
00:34:38 - Michael’s iPhone
sounds great. never done that before, but I started tracking and I was like, oh, okay, I guess I am pretty close to the 2000 thing.
00:34:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I think your protein is low.
00:34:49 - Michael’s iPhone
And protein is low.
00:34:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because on average, just to maintain your muscle level and your weight. I would. say you probably need at least 100 grams of protein every day. So it's only a little bit under because you're averaging. Well, it should be, that would be, wait, seven days, yeah, 700, and you're at 663 for the week. So probably a little bit under, but we were already talking about more protein and probably you sleep at night. Unless it was fat and protein, because the things that you were eating weren't just high on protein, but they were also high in fat hot dogs, pizza. What was the other thing that comes? yeah, yeah, yeah, saturated fat specifically, which we definitely don't want to have more of. But I don't know what is the concoction that's helping you sleep better. Was it was it the protein? Was it fat? Was it protein and fat? So that's something to start really looking at is what is your, what is your your last meal of the day? So these are macros. That's helpful. I would really like to see the mark. specifically of the last meal of the day. And you can look at that in the log, go lose it. Dash or let's see, no log. Okay, so dinner, if you click on the dinner, let's say, go to yesterday's dinner.
00:36:21 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay.
00:36:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if you click on it, you should be able to see all.
00:36:30 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, view meal summary. There it is, new meal summary.
00:36:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yeah. So we want that just every day, and then we'll make a correlation of that between sleep. want to look at everything overall, too, so we can just kind of see when you do start making some changes, just what it kind of has an impact on your, like, brain fog sleep performance mood. Yeah, but, but that last meal of the day. So let's go look at. your sleep stuff.
00:37:03 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh yeah did you do I so I changed the document the old ones called outdated and I put a new one called spreadsheet.
00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm quite proud of it I think it looks a lot better. Okay. Do you report weekly report? Was it no that's not the weekly report. Let me just I'm just gonna forward it because I'm looking under use specifically and I don't see it. There it goes. I came through.
00:37:41 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah that didn't come through.
00:37:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
for whatever reason I didn't come through before. look at that restful sleep. That seems like it's improved.
00:38:01 - Michael’s iPhone
Well, that's because Esther this week started letting me miss the two evening feeds, so that's what I've been getting a chunk of restful sleep.
00:38:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but your first week, like before the baby came, this is even better than that.
00:38:18 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, that's that.
00:38:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is, I mean, let's go to outdated. Shush, see if I have the original slide, whoops, the first one, yeah, oh, that was an apple lot, because the first week you didn't have that, and we're tracks differently. So I don't have apples to compare, but either way, let me. I do like this better. Why is it better? don't know, but it looks better. I can see everything. That's why. Good job. I put it bar.
00:39:14 - Michael’s iPhone
I put like the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. But it's actually weird because Monday is actually looking at Sunday night sleep. Right. It's like baby for sleep. I remember that.
00:39:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:39:27 - Michael’s iPhone
So. Is there a way to look better now?
00:39:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:39:30 - Michael’s iPhone
Thank you. I'm quite proud of Good job.
00:39:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Somewhat rested. Oh, good. tagged how you felt. That's good. And that would be helpful to review too.
00:39:42 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, no. That's not antagonizing.
00:39:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the sleep tracker assumption. Oh, okay.
00:39:49 - Michael’s iPhone
Um. What is the app you told me?
00:39:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sleep watchers. Yeah. It does have a function to where you can set it to ask you how rested you felt. felt during the day or how fatigued you felt, so I don't remember what the language is, but I think it's fatigued.
00:40:07 - Michael’s iPhone
I'm just very happy these last three weeks. I've actually worn my ordering, worn my Apple watch to get the data. So yeah, it's getting incrementally better on our data. Okay, I'll try to I'll try to enable how like how do I feel when I wake up?
00:40:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not just how you feel when you wake up, but how do you feel middle of the day? Okay, good.
00:40:34 - Michael’s iPhone
I'm sorry, in the journal, I was making notes of that. Sorry, you out again. Oh, I was noting some of that in my journal vlogs. My daily journal.

Did I have a really hard time writing?
00:40:58 - Michael’s iPhone
Sorry.
00:40:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see. Oh, It's a little bit better though, but it's also it's hard to go through that and find just the specific things that I'm looking for. So if you open your sleepwatch app, let me, let see what this says, sleep. There is a, let's see, is it for the setting, the course?
00:41:24 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, you know what? It's funny now that I open it. so I don't open this app every day. only open it when I send you the documents. Oh, okay. So actually, it literally, right now, it's just like, how well rested did you feel?
00:41:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, okay, I'll start welling this in. Okay. Yeah. maybe I'll have it allow notifications. Because that will be the thing that will pop up in the middle of day. How fatigued are you? Okay.
00:41:57 - Michael’s iPhone
Allow notifications.
00:41:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it. I'll think of it. Yeah. I'll play around with little. That's the whole thing, right? That's the iterations of it's a little bit here, a little bit there. So we're going to get the, let me just get back to my notes. So we need evening, macro, log reports, added to the...
00:42:23 - Michael’s iPhone
So maybe the best way for that is to take a screenshot, because I don't know, but I don't can get it. don't know if get all that way. Yep, screenshot would be perfect.
00:42:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
okay. And we don't have to do this forever, but a few weeks of figuring out, okay, what is all the data that's pertinent? What is the report that's giving us the pertinent data? Review it for a while, make some changes, and then, you know, do this exercise again in a few months and see how you're doing. Or... or if an issue pops up, or if you're like, I'm actually sticking really good, all these things are good, then we wanna go look and go, okay, what was the thing? So we're not gonna be digging into this, like this deep for such a long time. We're basically getting a baseline right now, making a very small plan for whatever you want to do, right? Cause you don't wanna have like a diet overall or anything like that. So this is just data, and then knowing what are the things that impact you? So when you're like, I need to do something different, this is not working, then you know what things are gonna have an impact on it. Okay. I like it. All right. I'm so excited that you found somebody.
00:43:40 - Michael’s iPhone
You don't get to start till September. I know. She said, you know, we could do some trial runs with her on the weekends and give Esther wants to get out. So we might actually do that and just trial runs or something. What about if in the meantime, you have your cleaner come every week? Yeah. Yeah, we've talked. to about that. This goes back to the thing I we don't really like our cleaner and Mark actually suggested. Yeah she's just a little, well I talked to I actually talked to Mark about this and our house is like little bit larger so there's a lot and Mark was saying maybe make like you know like that list you were saying for my manager or the feeling like Mark was saying why don't you make a list like that for your cleaners so it's like do this at minimum and then at least we'll be like happy yeah because right now she misses the window like not the window sills but when you open a window she misses the inner groove and Mark was like yeah but for a 3000 square foot house like unfortunately you're probably gonna have to tell her to like hit that so I was like okay so yeah that's maybe that's another thing I'll work on I'll talk to Esther about leaving the dishes till tomorrow and then also I'll work with her on creating a list for the cleaner and see if it works. And if it does, then we can increase it.
00:45:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because that's just like, I don't want to pay this person every week. I'm just like, OK.
00:45:08 - Michael’s iPhone
And you can change it every week.
00:45:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I have my cleaning list. It's just a Google Doc.
00:45:16 - Michael’s iPhone
And oh, you have a list.
00:45:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can I have it?
00:45:18 - Michael’s iPhone
I mean, it probably wouldn't be relevant to you because I have a working on.
00:45:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So she also is great at organizing like a Marie Kondo type thing. And so I've got her working on projects plus my baseline cleaning because I also have two teenage girls that want money from me. So they've got to earn it. So our doctors are going to be super different. But what I do is I tell her, OK, these are the things that need to get done monthly. These are the things that need to get done quarterly. And then here are the weekly projects. These are the must-dos. So if you're running low on energy or time or whatever, these are the things you must-do first.
00:45:56 - Michael’s iPhone
Or I'm not going to be happy. OK.
00:45:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. But thanks.
00:46:01 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah.
00:46:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But then she has to go update the report and she'll tell me what she got done and anything that she noticed. if I'm out of the cleaning supply, if something took longer because there was an issue or she noticed something that I wasn't aware of, so put that in the report and then also confirm the amount of time that it's worked. So, you know, like if she leaves early, I want to know if she works longer, I want to know whatever that type of thing. So, yeah. So we've got the cleaning and then we've got the project that you know you don't get to the projects until the cleaning is done.
00:46:39 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay.
00:46:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cool. Yes.
00:46:42 - Michael’s iPhone
Yes.
00:46:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's the thing, the documentation and any type of business or where there's an expectation of another person that's working for you. It just helps. First of all, it's a paper trail. It's clear. expectations. And in a Google Doc, you can view the history. So let's say somebody goes and like, oops, I deleted it. Well, you've got version history. You can go back and see every version of the document ever. So you can say, well, she said, Oh, well, it didn't say that then. What day was that? Let me go back and check.
00:47:19 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, actually, yes, it did. It said it on that day.
00:47:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you know, it's accountability. And that goes back to the nanny cam and help people do their best. So, but it makes you be accountable. And this is the thing I was talking to you about before, making sure that you're being a good leader and a good boss by being clear. And so if the documentation says, which he didn't really tell me what I needed to do, he said this, this was not very clear. He said this and this is going to take three hours. And I did this because I only had two. So this doesn't make any sense, right? then now we know there's a communication issue and nobody addressed it. So who owns that? Does she own it? Do you own it? That type of thing. So, Oh, anyway, it's a, it's a hard process.
00:48:03 - Michael’s iPhone
I'm excited.
00:48:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This would be great.
00:48:05 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. think we're going to make a big difference, didn't you? Yeah, we've been meeting to do that list, like Mark said, but I think it's more specific list. That'd be great. We'll do it.
00:48:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that goes back to big rocks. First things first. So the big rock is, is, is really that the communication is clear and the expectations are clear. Because almost always when there's an offense or a problem, it's because expectations weren't meant. And usually when expectations are met, it's because expectations weren't clearly set in the first place thoroughly in all encompassing.
00:48:45 - Michael’s iPhone
Please make that a note. Esther has been telling me that for years and I agree, like when I lose my , that's exactly what Esther tells me. she's like, did you set the expectations for your person that you're frustrated? I'm like, no. Oh, but it's a common thing I you hit a nail on a head right there and please remember to keep challenging me when you sense frustration about Something just as we work together. Um, yeah, please know that's a huge problem. I have and I am trying to work on it, but What you just said when I get frustrated, I should probably turn inwards and be like, did I send my expectations right? they know how to please me? Yeah. Um, But great point.
00:49:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
good. need to do that. Yeah, yeah and um Another thought as I've been working on my like psychology. Did you agree? I'm like, man, I think we always have to be learning I wish everybody was learning because we just sometimes just get really complacent but um Just understanding what the mechanics of certain things are anxiety is basically the fear of the unknown That leads into expectations, right? If expectations aren't clearly said, I don't even know how I can satisfy them, do you know what I mean? So, think about working for somebody who you want to please and you ask them what they want and they told you and the tone that they use is, okay, this conversation is done and I'm going to tell you, you have that tone, I plow through it. It's not a bad thing, but you're like, the way that, okay, so if I do this, oh yeah, okay, that makes sense and I'm leaning in and I'm looking you and I'm pausing, there's potentially room to continue the conversation, right? You're like, oh yeah, that makes sense. What does that mean? How would you read that?
00:50:48 - Michael’s iPhone
I'd be like, okay, well the next time you do it, you better do it exactly right, otherwise there's going to be an issue there.
00:50:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Most people, and especially in a subordinate position. would take that as you just wave me off this is done you physically you physically make a signal a subordinate is most of them are going to take that as a that was dismissed this conversation probably should be over they don't want to hear more about it I have to watch when I do that and it's not necessarily a bad thing it's okay moving on but it is very much a signal of moving on when you're working especially with women first of all generally speaking they have to be very good at body language and signals women are raised differently but but you you learn you learn the environment you learn where you fit in what you're to do and women tend to just fall in line with that. So when I've been trying to hire and train assistants and autonomous leaders, I have to get them to push past those signals. And it takes years to do. And not all of them can do it. here's the crazy thing. It takes years to do, even with their boss, right here, saying yes, please tell me what to do. Yes, please probe. Yes, please hold me accountable. Yes, please ask me why I didn't do what I said I was going to do. Even with that, it takes a couple of years to get them to do it. And even still, they're like, I feel like I'm being bad. feel like I'm being pushy. feel like I'm being bitchy. feel like I'm, you know, like, and it's annoying people. So.
00:52:52 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, I got, I, I'll watch that next time I talk to, uh, I'm not going to have a conversation by manager today, actually, so. Well, we do it on the phone, but yeah, I'm sure there's signals that I give them on the phone room like, okay, done. Let's go. What are we doing next?
00:53:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's not really true. So what that you could do is just go, was there anything else you wanted to talk about that now? Okay. I'm also big on call control. I don't want it repeated. If you've told me the same thing twice, I don't want to hear it again. I don't, I got it the first time. And so I'm not telling you it's a bad thing. And I do the same thing, but I have to be aware of, okay, I have to catch myself in it and go, did I hear what you needed to tell me? Did we address the issue in full? Are you clear? Am I clear? If we're clear, let's move on. We don't need to keep talking about it. But if you're not clear, then, and I'm your boss, then I need to sit there until you get clear. So here's the other aspect of it. If you can't get clear quickly, and you frequently can't, get clear quickly, you got to go. I got to replace you.
00:54:03 - Michael’s iPhone
Interesting. Interesting. You know, yeah, okay. Yeah, you know, when my manager, we get clear real quick with him. And I feel like we're on the same page, but some of the people we've hired that he managed is when I talked to them, I'm like, and I think that probably drives my body language when I talked to them because I'm like, okay, we said it, let's go, but it always takes me. Yeah, I'm just like, I don't know if we got it.
00:54:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know that. So, yeah, interesting. But but but then you have to ask yourself what's the talent pool possible that somebody can meet me at this level with what I'm willing to pay them. So then you have to decide what is the Are you going to take that amount of time every single time you have to get clear with them? Or are you going to go pay two, three, times as much? So you've got somebody who's just going and doing the thing. So there's always trade-offs. You just want to be consciously making sure that you've made the choice and then be in it because you're dealing with people. So if you have to explain concepts and it takes somebody three or four times longer than you want it to, but once they get it, they get it and they do the job, they're reliable, they're loyal, you know, they're lot of them. Then that is a trade-off that you consciously and willingly make and then you need to tell yourself, okay, I just got to calm down, sit back. Once you've gone through this, like, are you clear? And then you can practice, how do you get clear? What do they need? That makes it more clear. Do they need visuals? Because in your mind, here's the other thing. I haven't said this to anybody for a long time because I keep my clients along, that I don't have to train new people, but a lot of times people have more than half of the conversation going on in their head and only like 20% of it comes out. So you've got a full picture of what you want going on here and you've given instructions and they hear the instructions, but they don't see the whole picture. So that's where lists, examples, not that type of thing is helpful because now you've helped them get a picture and maybe they can't fully see the picture of what it is, but they can see a picture of what it's not because you gave examples.
00:56:44 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. Esther literally had this conversation because of us about how I was like Whitsen, my manager and I were both that are Whitsen with this guy, and it was kind of like what you're saying. I was like, I don't know what's hard about this. Yeah. I was that was what I was saying and then so yeah we did come up with a checklist for him. It wasn't a happy ending. still didn't do it and actually we switched him in the clinic. He was supposed to be my guy to check my reports. Make sure that I had the prescriptions right, that the amorizer ordered and he was missing it and I'm like you had one job anyway. And so what we did is we switched him to a customer service role. So now he answers the phone, you know makes nice nice with my cuz my patients takes the message and now it's like ah this is like and we actually put someone different in the role that we know is more meticulous and so now they like she it's a she checks all the things that the reports need to have and then it's good. We haven't had a problem in like a month so but yeah I asked her literally it was like you you can't like you didn't even try with this dude like make something happen. And yeah, so I tried, I did try, but it wasn't a happy ending that time, but I could probably do better things like a yes, no list. I just tried to give them a task list.
00:58:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So good to great. That would be a good book. So that's talked about, it uses in terms of org charts, right butts in the right seat. So let's say you're driving a bus and there's a designated seat for each function in the business, you might have all the right people on the bus, but some of them are in the wrong seats. They're in the wrong roles. Like instead of a manager, he should have been customer service. Sometimes you just got the wrong people all together and they don't belong there at all. And that generally, culture thing could be company culture, values, things like that. So you innately, or with Esther's help, I'm not sure, figured it out and well, the manager, the manager, my manager actually was.
00:59:00 - Michael’s iPhone
like, hey, how will we try this instead of just firing him? And I was like, oh, yeah, because he met all the other boxes.
00:59:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's loyal.
00:59:06 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, mean, him, I was in a month, right. Loyal, very friendly. And he met all the other boxes, he just wasn't doing this thing right.
00:59:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, a lot of things right.
00:59:20 - Michael’s iPhone
Awesome. I value loyalty lot.
00:59:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
yeah. And you should, and because you can't train loyalty. So, the other thing, and I know we're at time, but these are some of the things to look at. These are also levers, right? You can't, you can't train loyalty. You can't train integrity. You can train communication skills, but it's usually not worth it because it takes so long, because those are in-grain habits you're talking about a runway of years, which, you know, unless it's nepotism and you're trying to invest in a family member, for the most part, that's just not the best business choice to make. But you can train. skill level, you know, things like that. So if you've got somebody that's got all of the good things that you can't train, all the loyalty, all the integrity, they show up on time, they've got a great attitude and they're intelligent and they're trainable buying a place for that person, because you know what I mean? So yeah, okay, so you're gonna send me the meal macros for dinner and just add it to the reports and then we're gonna make a correlation with that and how you're sleeping. Sleeping seems to be improving. It could be Esther's letting you sleep in, it could be other things. So you're moving more, you're doing more, you just do more frequently and not only that, well, you weren't, but just knowing that you get to does something, it gives you something to look forward to. You know that there's an outlet that's coming, that does something instrumentally. Yeah. Yeah, I like to say it's borrowing energy from the future. When you worry, you borrow pain from the past. When you look forward to something you borrow energy from the future That's all I feel about it So anyway, we've got and and this is the energy You're already probably borrowing energy from the future knowing the cleaner and the babysitter and all of that stuff is coming You better send mark a picture Yes Help me pick it so he's Talking to Tina about the cars because he's like mark whatever Another car person he is though, and that's important and that matters what brings you joy brings you joy anyway okay, so Is there anything I mean again?
01:01:47 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh my last homework that I want to put down, but so I just wanted to make sure I I step my expectations, but I'm gonna talk to Esther about this is we're gonna make a list for the cleaners and my other and then the macros
01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Email to you. I do want to put in our notes that I want to finish the business spreadsheet.
01:02:05 - Michael’s iPhone
You gave me like a month to do it, but I actually want to finish it this next week. So I want to finish the business spreadsheet and that's what I'll work on this week.
01:02:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. And did you choose a time tracker?
01:02:20 - Michael’s iPhone
I haven't got that. I think I downloaded the toggle. Do you want me to work on that this week? Yeah, I do. I guess I'm fixed. I don't know. Yeah, I'm not really starting. I am starting on Wednesday like my work again. So I could do it.
01:02:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yeah, that's what I'm trying to think about. Maybe maybe we start that in September and then we can just. Okay. What I want you to think about it, but really we want. You're just in this transition period and it's kind of invalid data. The whole point of it is. real data and we don't have a flow yet and the flow is going to drastically change probably in September. I don't know, maybe not. So that's what I need you to think about is how much it'll change or not, knowing that you're in a season of change that is going to continue to change. So take that into account and then you tell me when you think it's a time to go ahead and track it knowing that it is changing. Again, we're looking for anomaly, not necessarily anomalies but patterns and corollary data so that we have a type of assessment to be able to make and just have something to pick on for optimization because there's infinite things that we could pick on to work on and they make a difference but we want to pick the most leverage thing that's going to move the needle fastest and that starts with getting some data as a baseline first. So okay so I'm going to send you this stuff in Probably about 10, 15 minutes and then we'll work on it. But if any questions, thoughts, whatever come up through the week, you can always shoot me a message.
01:04:10 - Michael’s iPhone
Sounds great. Sorry to go over, but thank you for your time.
01:04:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Totally fine. It's less about the specificity at the time and more about accomplishing what we're here for, so.
01:04:19 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah.
01:04:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
have a wonderful meeting.
01:04:22 - Michael’s iPhone
Thank you for shifting. After this, we'll go back to the 10 AM if that's okay. Oh, yeah. It's just that weird moment. Yeah, and it should already be on the calendar, right?
01:04:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, that's correct. All right. I'll see you next week.

Can you hear me?
00:00:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Shona's not here yet though.
00:00:06 - mark sweet
Yeah.
00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Everything okay?
00:00:17 - mark sweet
Yeah, in Vegas right now.
00:00:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will text her real quick and see. Oh, well I said it was little don't I see it.
00:00:34 - mark sweet
For easy like how important it is to go and meet the doctors face to face. It does take a lot of time, but especially in other states.
00:00:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:00:46 - mark sweet
Yeah, it makes a big difference because there's more and more of these California firms just like going through or doing what they're doing and just trying to separate ourselves little bit and put a case to a name and whatever. I think it spends some time with them because the people generally like me a lot once they meet me.
00:01:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've noticed.
00:01:09 - mark sweet
Yay.
00:01:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's our trauma. I admit.
00:01:20 - Chona Sweet
What? Hi.
00:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi.
00:01:23 - Chona Sweet
I was in Google. don't know what happened.
00:01:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's um Um, sometimes the the events just have it there by default. Um, if I and if I'm not careful and don't delete it.
00:01:39 - Chona Sweet
So oh, uh, yeah.
00:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've had zoom issues all day. I literally just got it installed and marking it like 601 and had to uninstall it after fighting with it. So I'm audio only today. um, yeah. Okay. Let me go to my notes real quick. Oh, it was good. I've been exhausted all week after just getting back late and then taking my daughter to seminary. then this morning, she wakes me up at 4.53 a.m.
00:02:18 - Chona Sweet (3)
she's like, mom, I'm late for seminary. And I get up and I'm like, my heart's racing and everything because I'm like, oh, I slept through my alarm. And then I look at the clock and I'm like, you don't go for an hour.
00:02:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
there was no catching up on sleep.
00:02:33 - Chona Sweet (3)
I tried to with their like little tiny windows here and there.
00:02:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm just like, yes, that's been fun. But she's doing good. So anyway, how's your charting been going?
00:02:46 - Chona Sweet (3)
It's, you know, it's still a challenge, but I feel like I'm getting better. I feel like it's really yeah. It's still a challenge.
00:02:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's a work in progress. Whoa.
00:03:00 - Chona Sweet (3)
show me explain to me what's getting better um i don't wait maybe more than two days to chart so i guess that's a like an improvement i thought you told me you were gonna do your charting at the same day yeah it was getting difficult um how many people are you seeing each day so like um yesterday it's just telemedicine but two days before it's um i have almost almost 35 and 90 i would say 80 percent of that is like new patients because of the new contract we have like influx of new patients and yeah did you just tell me you saw a 95 patients on one day no no no no I said 90, 80%, 30 plus patients, actually I feel like it's more than that I have to count because it's like 18 in the morning and I think I have almost 20 in afternoon and like 80 plus or 90% of that are new patients. So when it's like new patients I was just a lot more charting because they're new.
00:04:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what's the average length of time to chart for a new patient?
00:04:40 - Chona Sweet (3)
I honestly do not.
00:04:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like I don't really time it but that's the first thing that we need to do. And so here's what I'm to tell you, Chana. I said it in the beginning but now you're getting to the point where like we can really kind of feel it. This is tedious.
00:05:00 - Chona Sweet (3)
in the beginning, right?
00:05:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is tedious in the beginning. But if you will do the things that I ask you to do, we will get through the tedious faster than any other way. So timing yourself and observing the things I'm going to ask you to observe is adding tedious on top of tedious. But the fastest way for me to help you systemize and simplify what you're doing and to speed it up. Is to be able to understand what the baseline is first. Yeah, and I can send you notes at the end of this too.
00:05:40 - Chona Sweet (3)
Let me go make sure my note taker is working because I feel like it's definitely more work for new patients. I definitely find myself. So, you know, getting, you know, I'm trying not to, because I'm trying to, I know it's going to be all hard work. It's just that I feel, I know early on that when I get busy with the PI stuff, I know which one to cut. And I don't, and I know, when I say I have to cut means, I know what to tell Dr. E, which one I don't like.
00:06:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you mean, like between what you're doing in PI stuff?
00:06:42 - Chona Sweet (3)
No, because the PI stuff, because it's like, remember the one, two, three, I'm on number one, which is the main word. And out of the number one, there's three categories, I guess, if it says that, first it's the hottest. Hospital rounding and I haven't even get to that because I have yet to get the privilege from the hospitals So there's one the second one is the clinic work, which I Don't know I guess from the beginning. I already know that I don't like clinic Mm-hmm, but the clinic setting are like the bread and butter of a Pain clinic basically, so that's where the bulk of our patient population is and that's where the Remember if you if you remember the the contract that I was saying that he the doctor He recently acquired that's where the majority of patient will be and then the third category is the telemedicine Which is you know, just how it tells tell them medicine phone call, but it's best basically medication refill or ordering other treatments for the patients. And yeah, so the number one cat, a number two category of seeing patients in the clinic is my least favorite because I feel like it's just more work in terms of charting. Seeing patients in the clinic, it's not my favorite thing ever since I become a nurse, I don't like clinic work, maybe because of the charting and I mentioned before to you, I really don't like writing a lot, but the hospital setting is very much focused charting. I think that makes sense, oh, the patient have pain here, it should be the same, but for some reason that clinic charting has more charting and it's just annoying. However, I know that the PI or the pain or the personal injury cases are considered clinic patients, but obviously I feel that I'm putting a lot more effort on the PI clinic patients if that makes sense. Yeah. And I'm trying not to in a way because I don't want to be that person that I have to take care of the patient more because I'm getting paid more on it, you know, but I talked to Mark about this the other day and I don't know, it doesn't sit well with me, but I know it's the reality of the situation and not just me. I'm sure everyone that gets paid more on PI patients, you know, day. It kind of like I have to give a little bit more I Just work on it.
00:10:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just find myself catering to them more and Kind of don't like it in a way, but at the same time I do I the reason why I said I don't like it I want to treat everyone the same I guess that's why I'm trying to say okay so Let me ask a few questions and figuring this out will It'll take a while it'll it'll take multiple conversations, which is gonna take multiple weeks But what do you like about your job?
00:10:43 - Chona Sweet (3)
I like when Ever since I become nurse it's been typically A management, which was 11 years ago. I like that I Work as an NP, which is a different level of autonomy As compared to being an RN, a bedside nurse, I like that I can give what I think would help with the patient. I can order it right away and I can see the results right away, of like ABC type. I like that. And then lastly, I like it when a patient with, you know, the instantaneous gratification of saying thank you because it helps them. Eventually, the most difficult one is in the pain population, they're one of the most difficult ones because there's a lot of, I feel like, negotiation skills that I'm doing, you know, like, I can't give you more narcotics, but trying to convince them that narcotics is not the only treatment, there are other treatments. It's difficult, but it's fulfilling once they've Realize it themselves.
00:12:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so like what, what kind of treatment do you suggest? I'm like sure you have all kinds of different types of pain and levels and options. But what are some of the non narcotic options that you suggest?
00:12:21 - Chona Sweet (3)
So like, um, I guess I'll talk to it based on my experience. I can do things like my experience in the hospital, which is the bulk of my experience. Because I work in a hospital, you know, as a pain and P is in the instantaneous result of I can order IV tylenol and some people don't even know that exists or IV magnesium or IV vitamin C for pain. And some people would not even think that even helpful. Yeah. Um, or even can. I mean, ketamine is anesthetic, it's not narcotic. So that's why I like hospital setting a lot. It's very instantaneous that there's more access. I just realized that just now, maybe that's the reason why I like hospital setting more. But now doing the clinic setting, while I'm awaiting to work in a hospital, like doing the clinic setting, I feel like I'm limited in a way and it's geared towards more intervention type procedure, which I was not, that's a new thing for me. Anything like if the patient has back pain and they will look at the MRI and see, oh, you have stenosis, you have narrowing on the disc and that's why the PT medication doesn't work for you. So we may recommend you to have an epidural which is done by the anesthesiologist. So notice that that thought process is very much common in the clinic setting, and that also correlates with PI patients.
00:14:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and so do you imagine that there's a path where you can understand the nuance of the clinical setting and so I understand that the limitations that you have access to options in the hospital that you don't have access to in the pain clinic and when you know that something could be really helpful and it doesn't require an invasive procedure and it doesn't require a narcotic which comes with all kinds of other side effects and issues, dependencies and whatnot, that that can be frustrating. But do you feel like you can and work with the options that are there and just and feel any kind of like personal satisfaction, knowing that you're giving the options that maybe aren't the same as the hospital, but that you're giving the best that's available to them in the place that they went to.
00:15:17 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah, yeah, I do. And I know that it's temporary until I have the privilege in the hospital. And I think it's designed that way to not make us feel that, you know, like just set stationary, like, oh, we're just doing clinics every day of the week, day to day. So how it's, so I in my head, it's temporary, so I understand. And I know that I need to understand the clinic culture and setting anyways, because that's how I can succeed with my PI cases, which is this, Number two, out of the three source of income. But also, there's one thing that is new, that I haven't fully utilized by myself because I'm not an experienced on it, is I can do injections on my own too. That is intervention, but that is something that I can do, and it's exciting to explore because I've done it multiple times without the E, but I haven't done it by myself. So I almost did it by myself the other day, but Dr. E is available, so I'd rather him do it with me. Yeah, well, that's in and of itself, it's a procedure, but it's not as, I guess, it's excessive like an epidural interest, yeah.
00:16:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so what we'll do every week is try to figure out what are the, Because even in the beginning while you're still wrapping your head around everything and waiting for access and whatnot, there should be something that we can do. And even if it's just a perspective shift, like earlier in the week, we talked about writing your own story, know, that what you feel like your limitations are culturally, language, that's not permanent, you know. You, there are different things that you can do, and we talked about just the practice using, using translate tools, using chat dbt, whatever to help you overcome the language barrier. And then over time, because there's, there's only so many things you're going to have to write over time. Obviously, there's a wide variety, right? But eventually the repetition is going to kick in and you're going to know the same phrasing and you're going to know it in proper grammar and you're not going to feel embarrassed anymore, and you're not going to feel like you're less than for any reason. We know that the only way that's going to happen is over time. So we can't shortcut that per se, but we can kind of expedite it with the tools that you use. And then the other thing we can do is just you just remind yourself that your story today isn't your story next year. So and kind of looking forward to that. And a year is one of my favorite perspective tools. So it's really difficult to to map out significant change when you're evolving as a person, even more so than professionally. Sometimes professionally you can do it, but the the wow effect really doesn't happen in a month. It doesn't happen generally in a quarter in the six months, but the wow effect is almost always happening. Like I've never not had that happen with anybody I'm working with in the course of a year. You look back over a year, like, that was significant, even when it's just kind of. still subtle, you can clearly see some measuring points where this was, you know, significantly different or that was significantly different and then you can kind of add in the compounding. So one of the things I just want you to do every day is remind yourself that, first of all, define and I think I asked you in text but I'm going to ask you now as kind of write down what you want this to look like a year from now. How do you want to feel about charting? How do you want to feel about the way that you write? You know, I don't love writing. I hate it. I'm 48 years old. I'm never going to love writing it and now typing but if I could just automatically download everything I wanted to say, then I'd be happy but that's not going to happen. So anyway, you know, it doesn't mean that you're going to love it or feel like you're great at it but what we do want to do. Um, is at least not feel so much resentment or frustration about it and, um, if it's one of those things we just have to bear down, then you bear down, but there are dictation softwares.
00:20:14 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:20:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. so are you using anything to help you with that?
00:20:18 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah. So, um, Dr. E actually just called me today and say that, um, he bought a, the, the dragon for healthcare. They, that's what they like.
00:20:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:20:30 - Chona Sweet (3)
but I can't use it on the apples. So, but he, he said he got me a lots of which I'll, I'll get it tomorrow. So, I'm excited for that. I'm sure I still have to be vigilant on editing it because of my accent until it, until it adopts, I guess, to my accent, but, um, I, I, you know, I, I think what I feel to do today. I feel okay. I, I don't feel like. It just waxes and wanes how I feel on, you know, feeling quote, unquote, less than, but I'm happy with what I've been doing. I mean, it's not perfect. It's a work in progress, but I, I feel like each part of the three, the streams of income, I'm working towards like the, like, I told you the Washington, I submitted that already. So I contacted my university to submit my transcripts to Washington State, and I'm happy about that.
00:21:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
okay, that's an accomplishment. Yeah. Um, so I just did a quick Google search on how do I do new patient charting faster and I put pain clinics.
00:21:44 - Chona Sweet (3)
So the first thing I came up with is use dictation software like dragon.
00:21:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The other one it said was electronic health record can help you chart faster by automating tasks and allowing you to chart from anywhere.
00:21:58 - Chona Sweet (3)
And yeah, we can. Yeah, which is what I do that I feel like being having the capacity to chart at home It's a blessing and occurs in in a way to me because I feel like I Have this sense of okay. I finished seeing the patient boom boom boom. Maybe do a quick You know jot down a few notes on each basin and just tend the note and then chart at home So that means I'm finishing my work at home versus finishing it at work Which I think I should not dab it as a good as bad. It's just how it's just what I I'd rather be at home And chart at home be comfortable, but that means I'm bringing work home at home And sometimes I push the limit on maybe I can do it a little bit later and then yeah I'm up till 2 a.m. It's a slippery slope.
00:22:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so this is where you really want to define your values When when I talked about like writing your story what so this is this is not not. This is going to be an iterative process as well. So what I would like you to do is kind of map out your ideal week. Now, it's not going to be the same all the time. Some weeks you're going to have special events, trips, things that you want to do. Some days you might have an extra load of patience. days, know, we're women, there's an entire week that sometimes just feels terrible once a month. It's all kinds of things that can affect you and reduce your productivity, reduce your mental capacity. So you have to take that into account when we when we map out the ideal week. There are people that will call it like a perfect day exercise. There's no such thing, but the ideal week and you want to look at like what is your work day look like? When do you start? How are you starting your morning? do you want to feel in the morning? do you want to think in the morning? What do you not want to feel? And then a negative match list is really, really important because a lot of times it's easier to write the positive things by putting in the negative attributes. for me in the morning, I don't want to feel stress at all. It's bad for me physically. cortisol is dangerous. It's really difficult to capture goodness in the rest of the day and to be productive. But also the morning time and in the evening is when I'm with my girls the most. And so I don't want to spoil or even infect them with negative energy and stress. So I don't check email. I don't look at anything that could cause me stress. And also I'm most creative in the morning and late at night. So it's kind of the wee little quiet hours around the house. don't know if it has to do with timing or just has to do with around. But for me, those are the creative times. So in those times, I want to make sure that my schedule is not, I don't want to be having conversations. So I don't schedule calls until after 10 or 11 during the day because I want to do my creative organizational administrative tasks in the morning and in the evening as well. So I don't have calls during that time. So those are some of the things that I've figured out for myself in terms of types of tasks. other thing I've realized is that I have my best phone call time between 11 and 2, 10 and 1. Kind of depends on the day. But I want to help people. I have more energy during that time. My brain is functioning well at the time. And because of what my clients pay me, I want to give them my best brain for problem solving and also my best energy for other people's problems. So now you've got a different kind of schedule. don't have as much flow in that, but what you do have is what kind of home life do you want? What do you do anything in the evening that you want to protect? Is there a dinner time? Is there a snuggle time? Is there a you want to go for a walk? Is there a hanging out with friends? I'm like, whatever those things are, and maybe it's not the same every day, but whatever those are, you want to kind of plan how you do your charting and whether or not you take it home that night based off of the things that you want to do. And you also need to be aware of your discipline and your tendency to let the work creep into the most important things. So, and I'll tell you another kind of filtering process that I use to make some decisions, because generally the choice. that we make aren't between whether it's a good thing or a bad thing, which is easy, right? Because if I know it's bad, I'm not going to do it. But it's degrees. So a lot of times it's between good or better or best. But because you've only got 24 hours in the day, and you're only conscious for approximately, you know, 14 of them will say, allowing for the waking up and then going to sleep and actually being asleep. But and then there's only so much that you're not commuting and you're you only have control over what you're doing. If you say, if you give your yeses to the good things, to just good things, then you don't have yeses to give to the better things. And you don't have yes to give to the best things, because you're already committed by doing good. Well, it's not bad that you're doing good, but it's not the best. And you know, we get one life, we get one day at a time to do things. So thinking about, do you want to have your best day or You want to have a good day, obviously. Nothing wrong with a good day, right? But good days are just that and they're not necessarily inspiring or as fulfilling. So just kind of thinking about if you finish your charting at work, do you have your best chance at having the best night or a good night, you know what I mean?
00:28:27 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah, I mean our market's traveling right now, but we really are kind of like, I forgot the term used, but we like to walk at night or late at night even, like 9, 8, but I find myself charting, like if it's not here, if it's here I find myself charting. So I feel I'm not a morning person. So I like to do things in the afternoon or night time, so like the clinic work, it really starts at 9.45. So before I go to a clinic and if I have telemedicine, let's say I have 12 or 10 patients I need to call, I try to call that first while I'm at the house before I get to the clinic. And then Dr. E is like, oh it's a quick two, three minutes, four minutes phone call, but for me being new, I found myself talking to them for a longer time, that I don't think it's necessary, but I could have probably make it more necessary.
00:29:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know what you might do, I don't know if you'd be willing to do this, but call control skills are a big thing. I've talked to Mark about it because his people could use it. Most people don't have have great call control skills. Some people do, but it is a skill to kind of finesse a conversation and keep it on track, especially when you want everybody to feel good and you want to make sure that they're happy and they feel taken care of.
00:30:20 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah, they don't feel right.
00:30:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, but you can to accomplish isn't whether or not they feel rushed. It's whether or not they felt heard, seen, understood, and taken care of. The timing is not relevant to them. So if you can deliver an effective conversation where they feel heard, seen, understood, and taken care of, they don't care if it took three minutes. They just care that it was effective.
00:30:50 - Chona Sweet (3)
Does that make sense?
00:30:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, right. That's true. If you have the ability to record some of your phone calls and have Dr.
00:30:58 - Chona Sweet (3)
listen to them and say, Okay, what could I have? down to tighten this up then maybe he can give you a couple of scripting type ideas like say if this comes up this is what you should say if this comes up this is what you should say or he might say things like chon never ask this question because it's always going to lead to way too much like and if you deal with this type of person like i'm sure since he gave you that kind of time frame he's probably got some finesse type skills that he's picked up that he could give to you but he might not even know where to start unless he hears you and goes oh yeah here's where you're messing up and you could tighten this up does that make sense right it does um although i probably feel like in a way dr e is the quintessential doctors that are i don't know how to say it but i'm pretty sure i understand what you're saying so it's like uh you're doing good no changes oh how's your kid okay great so Let me first let me refill your medications. We'll talk to you next time. Okay, that's it. So And I feel like in a way, I feel I need to ask more. I am sure because I'm still, you know new to the group and I don't usually call patients on the phone and end up just prescribing them narcotics, whether they're on it for a long time or not. Like today, for example, I was talking to a cancer patient. Cancer patients were more lenient with narcotics, right? want them to be comfortable, right? I'm talking during the phone and she sounds very, very sleepy. And I can hear there's family in the background coaching her what to say. I said, I can hear your family in the background, I can talk to them if you're okay. with that. And so I ended up talking to the husband and the daughter. And I was very, very clear to have to be clear that, you know, if you think he's being very sleepy, do not give the needed narcotics is the last thing you want is for her to stop reading. And, you know, things like that, I feel like there's just no way around it. I just need to make sure that they understand what I'm trying to say. yeah. And then the other day, there's a patient like, I'm done talking to with her. And then she's like, oh, okay. And I'm kind of like saying goodbye. And she said, you're the first person I talked to today. I feel bad, you know.
00:33:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if I told her, I told her, maybe you need to go out and talk more to your neighbors.
00:33:50 - Chona Sweet (3)
I don't Yeah, those are the examples.
00:33:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, I I understand that there's a reason I'm a business for myself, and I make my own roles, because I want to do what I want to do and how I want to do it. And you have to operate according to the dictates of your own conscience, but you also have to realize where you're at and what's compatible. So one of the things is that I didn't get to a place where I could be how I wanted to be just because I wanted to be there. I had to create and I paid a price. I walked away from all income while I had four daughters to raise by myself four different times. It was terrifying. At one point I was on food stands because I just wouldn't take crap from clients that it was making me unhappy. So when I say I'll pay a price, I'll pay a price that most people would never pay in order to get what I want. But that's not, you know, but there are some things that I did tolerate because I just needed to and because of the bigger mission. required it and it made me a better person because it is important I think to learn how to work within certain parameters and not just give up or want to grenade everything. I'm really good at grenading things and just be like, you know, blow it up. So there are areas I think where you you might be like I'm I have an opportunity to serve and I feel like I need to and there might be other times where you feel that you have an opportunity to serve and comfort but this probably isn't isn't the time and isn't necessary and some of the parameters might be and it's going to be hard asking yourself so the conversation with the lady who's lonely that's a that's a whole therapy session right there it is and I feel
00:36:00 - Chona Sweet (3)
Bad and to even say goodbye to her, but I redirected it in a way that gave suggestion, maybe a need to, you know, talk to your neighbors or call your family too. He's elderly. And again, I.
00:36:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm going to pause you just for a second because it you're not going to have the answers right away, but one of the things is you can kind of develop your own toolkit sort of thing. Right. So some of these scenarios that you run into and you know, this is going to take time. If I were to handle it the way that I wanted to handle it. But if I spend that time, then I'm going to lose my time with market nights because I have to spend more time charting because I spent too much time on phone calls. Or I'm going to be impatient with somebody else who also needs me because I spent too much time doing this and that's not fair to the next person. So there's all kinds of different reasons why it's important to. within boundaries because what they want and need most is is the medical attention that you've been assigned to give them. But what you can do is come up with some kind of scripted responses for certain types of things. So if you get somebody who's just lonely and you're working in a particular area, there might be resources that you could send to them and maybe you could say, hey, maybe you could get their email. Maybe you can just send them a letter and it's scripted and you have it pre-written. Like here are some things like I really want to spend more time talking to you, but and obviously there are probably things you just shouldn't say. Maybe you shouldn't have said that, right? You have to be careful what you say to anybody. Maybe you can say, hey, I didn't know. Maybe you didn't know about these resources and maybe it's a senior center and maybe it's a visiting program where people visit the elderly or or some sort of something where you've got a list. of resources for different types of needs that people might have. Maybe you have a cancer patient-specific type of list of resources like, hey, these are the things that you need to know and understand. For example, if they're too sleepy, here's the risks of taking narcotics. So is it more important to you that they feel absolutely no pain or is it more important to you that they live? You know, because sometimes those are the choices. again, just because I'm saying this doesn't mean that's the right thing to do. In the medical world, you have to be very careful with what you do. So I would run anything that you want to do and say by Dr. E, maybe by Mark, and just make sure that what you're doing is okay. But what I would say is try to find a way to satisfy that nurturing need that you have inside of you that loves and cares for people and why you went into that.
00:39:00 - Chona Sweet (3)
probably. I think, yeah.
00:39:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but also keep it keep it in perspective that if you give everything to one person, then it takes away from the other people that you're giving to you. And so kind of balancing it out and also that you can't fix everybody's everything. Right. You're not their therapist, you're not their daughter, best friend, sister, whatever. But you can be the person that takes great care of their pain and use them the resources and make sure that they know that there are other options, actually cares. Even if they don't feel that you care, Jonah, you know if you care. So that has to be something that brings you comfort too. Because if you took this outside of the pain management, how many times have you said something to someone with good intention and care and concern and they acted like you said something bad? or tried to hurt them or didn't care about them and totally took what you said the wrong way. It happens a lot, right? Yeah. Okay, so, right, so but you wanna make this personal and bigger when it happens at work because it's work and it's important and they have needs but it doesn't change the fact that people will take things the wrong way. People will get offended. People will project their other issues onto you. You have to be able to deflect that. There's no way that you're gonna be successful in this long term and be happy if you don't learn how to compartmentalize and deflect that projection and those issues that they're just not yours and it's not heartless. I'm like, I'm a bear at heart, so.
00:40:54 - Chona Sweet (3)
Right. And I think it's just a matter of, I think I've been with him. for a month, but it it's only been the last week that I'm really on my own. Yeah. he, I don't know, I think he's just wanted to make sure that I'm supported and I said that I'm fine, but I do have, I still have, I still find it challenging or difficult to complete the charting each day. That's still, that's still an ongoing issue, but it's not a new issue for me, per se, like I tend to procrastinate, especially if it's something that I'm not, like, if I just, if I know I would, I'd like to do something, I can finish it in like a few minutes, if I really, really want to. So yeah, I'm gonna ask you a word question.
00:42:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you cold? I Get cold easy Okay, cuz you're hugging a pillow and I want to know if it's because they're colder because they're stressed out and it's a defense Oh, I know the pillow is my comfort. Yeah, it's comfort.
00:42:18 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah Here like if I don't feel I guess It's like comforting because of other issues like You know with my you know other Insecurities with my body when I know that that's what I thought that that was and I just wanted to check if it was You just happen to be cold and it was warm or because Yeah, but when you got it And the way that you hugged it it kind of was an indicator that that that you that's that's this is trustful little comfort it definitely might comfort and I Get Well, I feel like the body image issues one thing, but this work, I don't like it when there's no, I don't have the flow because I just don't have it yet, it's beyond my control. So until I have that flow, until I know exactly what I'm doing in a week or two weeks, I would feel a little uneasy about it. But I'm trying to control what I can't control, that's where I'm at. Learning things about the PI and just, I feel like I'm trying to do things like simultaneously.
00:43:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're doing a lot right now, it's a lot to learn and it's not just a lot to learn. I would imagine there's some things that go through your head like, I don't really have to do this because you don't have to do it. It's one thing when you have to make money and take care of your family. It's just not, you know what I mean? But you have bigger aspirations and you have goals about how you want to see yourself.
00:44:12 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah, I definitely, you know, that's what I did the Washington right away and, you know, Mark is helping me kind of start the conversation about having clients from different chiropractors.
00:44:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:44:28 - Chona Sweet (3)
I know it may not happen until early next year, but at least I get my licensure and then hopefully we can start. I guess Mark is saying that I need to have a different LLC for Washington. Oh, yeah. I don't know. But, you know, that's like one thing and I definitely need organization with my receive. I don't know. What I'm doing now is taking a picture and putting it under my favorite. But with the upgrade updates of the iPhone, like I cannot see the favorites right away So I Just need to be more organized with that. don't have a lot of You know expenses right now, but the other thing that comes up is you know, I I need There's a lot of good things happening in my life my career like I really need to take care of my my body myself So I start working out and the instructor that I mean them The instructor that's helping me she have a scheduling system that texts people and I know markets kind of working on that as well But a keyword is mark is working on it and not mean I feel like like you're waiting I feel like I cannot it appreciates me that I have to wait for him before I can move forward I trust what he says, but it doesn't mean it doesn't frustrate me. Also, I understand that I'm not ready to eat my own in that honor itself also frustrates me. I feel like, you know, in my head, I cannot be super ready for this. I know I just have to like learn as I go, and I'm trying my best to understand as much as I can. And I also understand that with me doing this affects marks reputation. So that worries me, makes me anxious, but that's a conversation I have within myself that, you know, I know I'm new, but I have, I'm not new to what I'm doing medically. So that's just, it's like just all those things that I... My question is to Mark about this and you know, I'm sure it's just that growing process of this having a new thing.
00:47:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's the biggest thing is the newness of adult, everything's new. relationships are new, the processes are new, the pressure is new, time management is new, the knowledge of some of the things including business and different responsibilities. That's all new. Like you're having to wrap your head around and your body and your energy and your schedule and your routine and your mindset around all of these things all at once. And that's a lot, but you can do it. And one of the things I would love for you to do is just every day tell me something that went good, tell me something that you're proud of. So like you've got the Washington stuff done, that's great. Every day, just every work day, just send me something that you're like, I'm proud of myself for this. If you're struggling to find something like that and you tell me tonight, I don't have anything I'm proud of today, I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions until we find out what your product is, because there's no way you didn't do something that each day.
00:48:17 - Chona Sweet (3)
Oh yeah, I know. I feel like I'm already proud of, I know I've been there for, I think, on my third week, I was able to get the electronic prescription that my colleagues that's been there for a while apparently took them two to three months to get while I get it in three weeks. I was proud of that. Good job. I was at the other doctor that came at the same time with me, that started at the same time with And he texted me, and he said, how are you able to get get the, the, he he he he said, He skipped fast, so I tried to help him. But anyways, I was proud of that. But I don't know if I'm too, I'm proud of how I get it, but how did you do it? So I can call them multiple times, and it's frustrating. And there's a multi-step process that they have to verify cross match with your credit score and all of that. And for some reason, they cannot verify me. So I created an email. I created a ticket. And on that ticket, I wrote a long email, basically saying that I do not understand why their company or their system cannot verify me while the other government institutions like the DEA. Okay, for the California Board of Nursing, things like that, I mentioned names, these bigger government institutions can verify me, and your system cannot.
00:50:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how hard is that?
00:50:16 - Chona Sweet (3)
Well, I was, everybody, that's my favorite thing, is just be like, listen, so yeah, I kind of basically also said that, look, the way that your system is holding me back on taking care of my patients, so yeah, I was, I was initially part of it, but then I didn't know that Dr. E's manager can also see the text, and we talked to each other and she's like, man, I saw your text, I'm like, ooh, Jordan can be spicy, and it's like, I was annoyed.
00:50:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look, first of all, you're going to be able to take care of patients better, and maybe somebody got a little fire lit under them, they probably didn't, but You know, their apathy is a plague in almost every type of business and definitely inside of government institutions and good for you standing up, but good for you articulating. And here's the thing, because you keep talking about like what you can't do with your English and grammar and whatever, but your ability to articulate the, that's a good lawyer tactic by the way. Also, that argument was indefensible because you're like, wait a minute, like all these other people can verify me. The same information is available to you, yet you can't seem to be able to do it. I'm not going to tell you your inept, but basically I showed you your inept and also it's costing my patience.
00:51:47 - Chona Sweet (3)
Girl, I was shocked when someone responded to me via email on a Saturday. I was like, I keep on responding to them back and forth, I like caring. I try it again. I keep on trying and then I kind of said it like not ultimately but kind of I said this is the third and last time I'm going to try this. If this doesn't work your system needs to override me. That's what I said and they did. So I was actually shocked it worked but yeah.
00:52:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not that's my go-to move if I have problems with people. I don't have problems with Mark because Mark is always nice and good and everything but like if I like teachers, principals, whatever somebody not handling business very well, accompanying.
00:52:37 - Chona Sweet (3)
You know what this reminds me actually and I was telling Mark this that I really wanted to become a lawyer when I was in college but anyway that's a different story.
00:52:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh it's your but it fits perfectly with what you're doing because patients need an advocate and an advocate is another word for what attorneys do right. They advocate for their clients. Well, you need to advocate for your patients and that's all that you were doing as you were advocating for all of them by being able to have this process and do that so good.
00:53:10 - Chona Sweet (3)
So that what I was doing is Dr. E would let me see all his patients either with him or by myself just until I get used to it and then he has to order the medication for me and then the patient starts to get upset at me coming back or calling to the office saying you didn't set my medication but it's not my fault it's Dr. E's fault because he doesn't do it on time. So I have to do work around on that one where I said you're here, log in and I'm gonna order this and let you look at it before I send it so that's what we've been doing and I don't like that. I want to do it my own on my own my own time.
00:53:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah. Okay, so here's what we're gonna do I need you to time five new patient charts. and five follow-up patient charts okay okay just do it as accurately as you can it just will give us a baseline to kind of figure out what it's doing and and we'll see what we get from there okay you're using drag and dictation that has to train that takes a little while there could be some shortcuts some abbreviations things like that it'll take a little while to figure out how to optimize your charting system as much as can be done and then the other thing the other assignment is I really want you to map out and and write out what does your ideal week look like are there particular times of the day or times of the day on specific days of the week where you're not charting you're not staying up late you're doing something else going for walks with Mar watching TV, resting, whatever, like whatever the things are working out.
00:55:05 - Chona Sweet (3)
You want me to think of like in the future or my ideal in the period.
00:55:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how about now like what is compatible with your life as it is right now and what you would like it to be a year from now?
00:55:22 - Chona Sweet (3)
Okay because I feel like with the Washington it's gonna be busy. That's why I mentioned once that starts and you know took off then I will have to pick and choose what I do with Dr. Lee.
00:55:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's part of the benefit of this exercise is that we compare it with what you actually have to do and what's actually in your life and go do these things match up so either you're giving up some of what you ideally want in order to do these other things and maybe it's temporarily or you optimize your day and your time a little bit better because you want to do the work and also you want to have these other particular times. So the biggest part is just consciously evaluating what has to be done, what is wanted to be done, and how the two are compatible and where the compromises have to happen if you're going to do it all and what compromises maybe you're just like I'm not I'm didn't sign up for this this is not what I want to do but where you probably will be like instead of that and that extreme like okay I want to do all of this so how do I get more done in less time how do I and then it probably will because you're taking a lot on figure out which things are best for you whether because it's more satisfying to you it earns more money, maybe it's something that you and Marc get to do more together of in the PI stuff, even though you don't like that, like there's all these different things that have to be evaluated and they all have different pros and cons.
00:57:15 - Chona Sweet (3)
Right. I think eventually when that time comes, and I call it as a retirement career, because I feel like I will always want to do something using money, is that I can travel, and Marc can never talk about this, I know that eventually our goal is to be able to travel and still make money. Yeah. Well, like if I do the telemedicine, even if I call a certain amount of patients finding that sweet number is the goal later on, that will still make me money.
00:57:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. And when there's also point where you make enough that your money can be the way that you make your money through investments and other types of things. So if you have any type of interest in that, that's, that's, and just how long do you work? Do you want to work five years, 10 years, 15 years? How much do you want to work? How much do you want to earn? How much do you want to have in your investments making money for you? not just because it's money, but because you, you had, you wanted to feel like you did something productive and meaningful. And the one thing about earning your own money is that you feel like you can put it towards the things that you want to. Like, it's a different level of satisfaction. It's not about the money per se. It's about what it unlocks for you to be able to do. It's just a resource. you have your own time. Sometimes you have your own energy, right? have, but, but money is just another currency exchange that, that we use.
00:58:53 - Chona Sweet (3)
So it's not, but anyway, not the end of, you know, it's, it's, Yeah, it's not my, I want that so I can buy or do something that I want. make the travel and make money, think that's like the best thing I have.
00:59:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, my work is portable.
00:59:14 - Chona Sweet (3)
I can take it anywhere that I want to.
00:59:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I think about money for me and like energy. I don't, I don't want a lot of things that other people do, but beauty is important to me. scenery is important to me, experiences are important to me and they energize me. And with that energy, it increases my creativity, but also I take that energy back to my people. So, you know, being poor is not compatible with serving people the way that I want to serve them because I want to be thinking low level thoughts instead of high level thoughts. You know, there's a lot to take into account anyway, but so every day. Just tell me something that you're really proud of and that that and just celebrate the wins. You can tell me the things that you're frustrating. with you but we have to end it on this is what I did good or learned this is how I grew this is like some kind of something like that every day because it will just help keep things in perspective I need you to and I will write this out map time five new patient charts and five follow-up charts yeah every day just using dragon and getting a practice at it and just kind of seeing and observing do you feel like it's getting better just kind of just kind of watching the process and seeing what you can do and that's a start like that's a lot to do for this week and then the ideal week like what does the ideal week look like now and then a year from now knowing that it's going to change knowing that we're never going to have that picture exactly but that we have the greatest chance of creating something that you're really happy with by being intense. Intentional in terms of how you create it Yeah Thank you You're welcome. Do you have any questions or anything? No, I um, I just yeah I I need to that's a very you know like actionable I said like I need to tie myself Yeah, and don't don't stress and obsess but you do wanna always push yourself like you committed to giving your best and I'll so I'll tell you one last thing real quick before we go and this is kind of my own Tool that I use and I call it an energy sandwich So if I have to do things I don't like Anything I don't like drains my energy and it makes me in a bad mood. don't like doing there's a lot of things to do But so the first thing I will do is I'll start that activity before I start that activity I'll do something that I like um It could just be snuggling with the dog. It could be talking to somebody I like. could be I had a good lunch. It could be a nap. It could be all kinds of different things. It could be good music. It could be sunshine breaks. I like to go outside and just let the sun absorb into my skin. I get the energy from it. It feels good. And then the other thing is afterwards I plan something that will boost my energy as well. doesn't have to be long. Sometimes it's just putting on headphones and listening to something that without fail I cannot be still. It makes me dance. It makes me just feel good. So I use music really strongly like that especially if I don't have a lot of time. And the other thing is if I do something that's super stressful then I need to go do a physical activity because the tension is in my muscles. So like a little walk that might be when I go to the gym depending on how much time I have. I might do some housework. Sometimes I will just pace back and forth. but it still gets all the energy out. So just kind of noticing how your activities are impacting your energy and trying to sandwich good things in between bad things, even if it's just for five minutes here and there so that you're not staying in negative energy for any excess of amount of time. Okay, I know I've talked your air off already.
01:03:25 - Chona Sweet (3)
I'll let you go. Thank you so much. don't know where Mark is but he's probably asleep now.
01:03:32 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)

01:03:33 - Chona Sweet (3)

01:03:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

01:03:43 - Chona Sweet (3)
I will send you an email in a few minutes with all those assignments. Okay.
01:03:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

Two Mark sweets.
00:00:01 - mark sweet
Yeah, I wasn't sure which one was right. So that's all right.
00:00:10 - mark sweet (3)
I just don't know one. They're just down just to one me.
00:00:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just you. That's OK. I just got up with Fuji this back to back meeting. I'm not used to it. And I'm like, I got to go.
00:00:25 - mark sweet (3)
No, he was asking me a question about multiple company names or a different company name for each day. what we have, if that wasn't really helpful. But his situation is a little different than mine because the tracking by a doctor name, not the only reason we have different companies for different states is more because of our trust account and because each day has different laws where it's a little different for him. So I mean, I'm the whole, it's better. But I don't think it's going to make a big difference.
00:00:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like. like um oh so I got to flip something for him. love when people think one thing about their business and then I'm like oh we go do some math and then you find out it's not that at all so July is actually way profitable way more profitable for him than Q and P.
00:01:18 - mark sweet (3)
Good.
00:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's pretty cool.
00:01:21 - mark sweet (3)
One quick thing from the legal side though just in a facamot, the CUNY practice that's legitimacy to his personal injury stuff.
00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh I'm not telling him he shouldn't do it. Okay. That was a nice like exciting thing for him to know that July was actually like that.
00:01:38 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah yeah good tea faces.
00:01:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh you guys always join on video and Fuji he said that it's more intimidating but like accountability so he's like I like when you're there because like I feel like I've got a I don't know pay attention so I think facial expressions which makes a difference rather than just seeing if on the earth. It's not okay.
00:02:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Great.
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My face is as crazy as my voice. Hi, Dan. What's up?
00:02:10 - mark sweet (3)
Okay.
00:02:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dan Jeep, my new voice.
00:02:15 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
My first, my second call.
00:02:18 - mark sweet (3)
voice hasn't warmed up yet.
00:02:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's my second call and mine has because I already got excited about nerdy numbers. There you go.
00:02:28 - mark sweet (3)
So this convention was interesting, the lawyer one. Everyone is just super, super, super excited about AI.
00:02:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, God, what don't they know that that ship was already sailed for about two years late? The K guys ship already sailed and sank.
00:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:02:49 - mark sweet (3)
What's in heaven and has it?
00:02:51 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
here's what saying, not like it has.
00:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It sounds like how you're talking about it. It's what?
00:02:57 - mark sweet (3)
It's not where it needs to be yet to be. effective. So it's never going to be.
00:03:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's it's it's always going to be about the promise. And say it from the beginning, he who engineers the promise wins. But the adoption rate by, you know, the general public is already on the decline. It only ever really hit 5%. And it's on the decline. So they're like, or this 's not, no one's going to use it. Most people don't even know what it is. They don't even know who the vice president is. And now she's running for president.
00:03:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They still don't know who she is.
00:03:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
She doesn't know. That's fine. And it's like, but, you know, there's the whole strawberry thing that just went around, right? couldn't count the R's and strawberry. It got it. If you ask Chachi B, Chachi Bt4, how many R's are in strawberry? it will tell you to right now. They haven't even fixed it. It's like, you should probably go fix that one. No, it can't do simple things. But that being said, I was talking to this buddy of mine.
00:04:15 - mark sweet (3)
The stuff that we've done that's really interesting is. I like fixed it. Now says the worst draw right contains three R letters.
00:04:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
There you go. It literally didn't work yesterday.
00:04:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, is it for me?
00:04:26 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Really?
00:04:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
00:04:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
See, it's not trustworthy. But if the stuff that we've done that's interesting is giving it the data set. So I think it's called RAG. I think the three letter thing is called RAG. And it's like, you're basically giving it a data set and then using it for its large language modeling against the data set that you trust, that you've said, hey, this is the thing. So it's good at that. And then if you, and if you then have it, you're updating that data set and or you're creating an application with it so that it remembers things and all that good stuff, then you're on another level. Then it can work. But what most people are doing is just like API and into chat, GPT. And it's like, yeah, not great.
00:05:25 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, the training the models were people are missing the huge problem. I agree with you, but it's time consuming and boring.
00:05:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, but most people second communicating and the way to make chat GPT work really well is to give excellent parameters. It's not just the prompting. It's the parameters of the prompting. Here are the boundaries. Also, here is the level of effort that you need to apply. So like if you ask at a basic thing, it puts forth basic effort. If you say, I want you to apply it as though you're this person using this logic, there's parameters, right? Completely different type of output. So like it said, there are two R's and I said try again and instead I apologize, there are three R's. So the other thing is you need to build in a check and balance system. So like I just told Fuji, I said go do your reports. I said, but then, because he's like, I'll use chat GPT do this. I said, okay, but then you need to go validate the data and make sure that what it told you is correct. And you can offer it for formulas and things like that. But the other part is most people aren't building in a check and balance system. I mean, have it in our government and not that it works, but whatever. there are also need to be something and that the problem is, and it's the same problem in every kind of business as people don't delegate. They, the hell is the word? You just give it off to people and you forget about it. My brain, I know this word is driving me nuts. Abdicate, people abdicate. So as soon as there is somebody that they think, can or will or something handle a problem for them. It isn't delegation. They just stop thinking about it. That's how embezzlement happens. That's how a lot of things happen. It's because people advocate, oh, this is my person for this. This is my system for this. It works. But we all know nobody and no thing works the same all the time. Life happens, human error, system error, economical error, whatever. So whatever system they build, there needs to be a quality assurance kind of check and balance system that gets built into it and whatever. It's not just about chat TBT and why I'm going off about all of this, but this is the thing that destroys a lot of businesses and a lot of more people when they get to the point where I can pay to delegate. Case in point, Mark, you haven't done anything bad, but I'm just saying this is the thing. You need to be a aware of in yourself don't how to keep the delegation right like we've had issues with our complaints and missing a statute because yeah so dealing with it yeah yeah delegating is one thing advocating is a thing you can't ever do and it has to be the most critical parts like why we why you resist the non-attorney model because attorneys have liability right and it's not just you owning all the liability you have somebody else in there that's got skin in the game and that's important because that that keeps a layer of protection against you strategically and i agree with that so the one interesting thing that keeps coming up and dandy you probably know more about this than i do is they're having these bots listening in on the calls for tonal shifts and for I guess voice for lack of very term is the person sound happy to add positive for us
00:09:00 - mark sweet (3)
some of these things. And obviously they're trying to pressure their problem like flags the call for a manager or supervisor to listen to it, whether it's a training issue or potentially an upset client or what happened.
00:09:11 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
There's no way it's listening to the tone.
00:09:14 - mark sweet (3)
No way.
00:09:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No disagree with you.
00:09:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure they're saying it. It would have to be a third party. They're not doing it.
00:09:25 - mark sweet (3)
They're using something that's already done it. If anything. Yeah.
00:09:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's probably more based on stop words than tone, right? Because just think the individual aspect of people's voices in general, right? how people speak differently. whether it's like people can't even pick out sarcasm text. People can't pick out sarcasm voice. Top words. Words of frustration. Words of anxiety. Words of that all day long. can see that being more effective than. and then looking for a tone or trying to identify tone. It could be a combination of the two, maybe, but I bet it leans more towards the word itself first.
00:10:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do think it's the word. So right now Chat TBT can tell you the tone of words, text. it does that. don't think it's, and also how much you can pick up sarcasm, especially thick sarcasm. I don't know how good it's at that. But the thing is, if people keep it in perspective, and this is what I think most people won't do, which is actually a benefit to all the other people who are going to be smart, is that you take it as a potential data point to go, like basically a flicker to go say, what's happening over here and go listen to it yourself and go, is this right? than I'm going to go and this is a problem person because Chat TBT keeps saying all their people are angry. angry and maybe it just can't even recognize it right or whatever.
00:11:03 - mark sweet (3)
You be able to figure out something like yelling or screaming.
00:11:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, it's it's going to be in this middleware. They're putting a middleware in place. I don't think that's yeah, I don't think that that's necessarily native to Chad GPT. So, I don't know if it's something else. It is. That's all anyone's using.
00:11:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, we'll see it open AI. That's what Chad GPT is, but it's open AI. it's all it's going to be so interesting, but keeping here's what we're talking We're talking and you're interrupting you.
00:11:45 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That don't track anything.
00:11:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You don't track anything. It's important to keep everything in containers, but that's what to your point of tracking is it's easier to do when they're in containers. Right. Daniel.
00:12:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean, it's just, it's all sizzle, right? It's typical lawyer , right? Those guys are the most easily sold people on Earth.
00:12:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's It's unreal.
00:12:16 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, I'm not very excited by Shawnee Ball. And I have no idea how to implement it, what it actually does in the background.
00:12:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and then they're not going to track it. So it's like, you don't even, if you did it, are attracted to what it is? Oh, yeah.
00:12:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, I'm pretty sure you got to have a lot of that to be an attorney, period, or just collectively coming from somebody that was one of my career choices.
00:12:45 - mark sweet (3)
There are multiple more to do this. Coquitos, one, apparently.
00:12:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
What, Pekker? What?
00:12:52 - mark sweet (3)
a weird name that is.
00:12:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
See you. Yeah, I just thought about it.
00:12:56 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:12:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are you looking at?
00:13:00 - mark sweet (3)
So, could you use a real-time AI system to analyze the live phone calls that take customer sentiment provide agents with live cushion and feedback, uses voice analysis, introvert motion, infuse like stress or enthusiasm. There's the observed.ai, does kind of the same thing.
00:13:16 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I mean, I don't think you need a real time, right? you could just find something that allowed you to download recordicals and mass-analyze those to like help nail a script first, right? Like, you know, they don't need like any or support yet, right? If you got a script that worked and you're like, okay, this script is solid. Now, the only way this script goes sideways is through the execution thereof. Therefore, now layer on something where you know it's not gonna try, it's just gonna sort of try to make them be more successful with the script, but maybe.
00:13:55 - mark sweet (3)
Maybe, I mean, the issue, and I'm sure we're coming up is these larger teams, right? Because if you've got, take, for example, and it's alerting you that Marie is not doing a good job for whatever reason, right? You would want someone to listen to it take it over because you could potentially have a large case, right, your hands. Doctors office was calling in super frustrated. You want to know right away rather than after the fact, after the problem.
00:14:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right, so like, I like the large case, right? But that would be like a word that could be like a stopboard based thing too, right? It's like, hey, if they say UPS truck, 18 wheeler, you know, you're like, oh, those are like, not stop words, but those are like flag words. Uh oh, this could be a commercial, you know, that kind of thing. But that would be the extracted via the script, right? So there's where the script would come into play to then sort of like was Tina was saying, sort of like what I was saying, you're not writing a prompt, you're just making making data available to the prompt, that's the prompt will say, hey, I can use that. Hey, that's something that I'm supposed to be looking for, and then it does its thing.
00:15:11 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, no, I mean, that was one big one. The other big one is, you know, even up does AI demand writing, which I don't know.
00:15:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, that I can see for sure.
00:15:20 - mark sweet (3)
Makes sense.
00:15:21 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
But you would do it, you could do that right now, but it's just a matter of you having a self, I mean, it seems like the, and this is what I literally was doing yesterday because, you know, I'm a loser. But I'm like, okay, I can just have the data in the Google sheet in like a row. And I just say, hey, this row. And I keep telling chat GPT, like, I don't need to build the database at this rate, but I need to someplace to store the data and say you're using this. Then it's a matter of like, you give it a demand. Let's say you get, let's. it's a demand for a dog bite or whatever, whatever it is, it's a car accident.
00:16:06 - mark sweet (3)
That's what we do.
00:16:07 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, do a car accident. But like, give me an example of one where you'd be like, it's a tip, like the setup where like, this is the demand is based on these four or five things. Like, is there a scenario like that?
00:16:24 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. So you're generally going to have liability. Number one, like, how did it happen? Who's that fault?
00:16:31 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay. So you're saying, yeah, injuries and injuries is the part you spend the most amount of time on.
00:16:37 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. Three state specific, which state did it happen in? And four is the rest of the board of plate template, quite frankly, you know, the terms and conditions and kind of the opening and just the boiler plate template.
00:16:51 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. So you have the first one probably has a fault, not a fault, right?
00:16:56 - mark sweet (3)
it just binary or is there a third? No, there's a third. Okay.
00:17:02 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So you, it's one of the three. And then the next one, so the injury would be the most complicated one, right? You'd have to then go through your database that you have, and litify like, Hey, here are all the possible injuries.
00:17:15 - mark sweet (3)
And then you'd have to build like a sort of matrix, which I can totally see with. Hold on. So when I say injuries, it's pulling from the medical workers of that specific client with what they had.
00:17:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Right. So, but you'd say, like, Hey, had an MRI. They had this. had that. So what is the number more based on the treatments than the actual injury? Like, Oh, it was their neck MRI. you build like a matrix and say they had MRI, this, this, this, this. And then maybe, and then the prices or whatever are included. So it's like, if you could dynamically say, Hey, like imagine, filling in a form and you're like, it's, it's not at fault, it's MRI, that, that, that, right, select checkboxes. And then it's whatever, whatever the next one is. So they submit the form, that goes in that then temporarily updates the set of fields. then the prompt go, then it hits the prompt and the prompt set, the prompt is written to say, Hey, you're going to look after it's half fault and you're going look at this and you're going to look at these injuries, then go look at this data set that has the injury pricing or whatever, or you're including that price. You're saying it's MRI 5000, it's this, blah, blah, whatever it is. And then the prompt is just waiting for you to give it those parameters. And then it goes and looks at your ideal demand, let's call it, which there's probably an ideal one, right? then boom, you'll write it and then the quick ideally you would write all this and you'd have a demand that's done well to compare it to. You say, okay, if I feed it this data, does the demand that spit out come out like this? Yes or no?
00:19:09 - mark sweet (3)
you see how to train it, like the ones already being written first, hey, mean, this information, no, here's a better example.
00:19:15 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
There's no way you could train that. Then you just start massaging that prompt in the middle.
00:19:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's like what we were having Fuji work on with his reports is feeding the data and the analytical process as much as possible. But then the other thing is the system for sure that should be built in is human approval.
00:19:42 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, yeah, no, doesn't just get sent out on and so.
00:19:46 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, well, and you could human score it at the end to go, now that's of three or the lawyer scores. Somebody, somebody that you trust their scoring.
00:19:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That right there. Mark's score basically for a while, and then train somebody that scores according to your approval. That's the thing for, okay, so going back to the application conversation and just the pace of the technology and the evolution, the innovation that is available right now is leveraged, all of this is AI stuff is leveraged if it's used right, but all of it has to be something that you learn firsthand, everything has to be. For example, okay, so Dan, the foundation of basis really is numbers tell the whole story, so we need to be able to have the numbers. When it comes to online businesses, most of those numbers come through the website, so the analytics. So he's diving into GA4, which is Google Analytics 4, right? It's a whole new beast. We've been using Google Analytics. I've been using it since 2002, probably. I think it was out. Maybe it wasn't that old. Maybe a few years after that. Let's see, 2008, I was getting into split testing. So anyway, we'll say maybe like 2005, people were already starting to use Google Analytics. And now it's an entirely different kind of thing. It's this whole host of a suite, basically, of things that you used to have to get somewhere else. But Google owns all of it. And because it's so new, even the experts are still just kind of figuring out how to use it. So he has a massive leverage opportunity to be an innovator right now, which is a business owner who understands how to tap into Google Analytics. And so he's doing it. He's been studying it for weeks. From an expert who I know personally and I've met and he that's all he's been doing is this this whole time So he's been going growing with it But Dan can't delegate this to anybody right and If he could it would cost it wouldn't it wouldn't be worth it The only one he could delegate to would be another expert. So for you with the marketing with the with the AI but also The business the culture all of these things coalesce into Something very unique for you specifically and subsequently sweet law, which does have its own Unique identity and culture, but I'm just saying The things that interest you If it's innovative and leverage the more you spend time on that and getting real data Talking with Dan. I'm kind of helpful with these things Sometimes he spends more time in it. But anyway, um, there, there's a lot of opportunity to at least figure out how we can shave a little time here and there. So we've been talking about the path to growth is optimization and leverage. This is it. If you can improve the script through analysis data, right, with AI, if you can improve, and not just the intake script, but the attorney's want to script two for certain types of scenarios so that they can be handling things more consistently. So like Lorenz for Mike or the case managers, actually, basically everybody, certain scripts for certain scenarios, they feel like they could be trained better to handle specific types of people and scenarios. Because they know their job that people handling is not what their best at knowing the law and case handling is what their best at people handling is a necessary part of managing the case well so like we've been talking about call control scripts or just I brought up the phrase a few times but when I brought it up to runs sorry hold on and when he brought it up to his team they all want training I need to tell you this by the way it was the last last week conversation but so using AI to kind of help us find scripts if you are listening somehow to all the calls in sweet law and can identify who handles inside the team already the best types of people like if we were able to and that we're not here yet I don't think with the AI but something to keep in mind about like best case scenario best use cases would be okay who handles um specific death cases who handles any type of thing or any type of person and they could label it by the language that's used um and then say okay this person does a really great job of handling this type of person like Mike with distributions. So what Mike does that Lauren said that stand out is Mike doesn't take it personal and he kind of scapegoats the the law firm he's like my hands are tired I can't this is just the rule like I'm I'm not the one deciding that this is what we're gonna get paid this is policy but for whatever reason the way that he says it diffuses the situation and then he can get the full attorney fees more often than other people without people being odd and so that's a skill right but is there a teachable not not necessarily scripts but maybe a logic so is there a verbal cue of some but he says this, respond this way, and the result is this. This kind of analysis, which you'd have to listen to so many calls to be able to do that, but if we could get to the point where I think we can, probably in the next year or two, AI could do that really well, and you could identify, you read the book switch, right? Do you remember the phrasing, bright spots? Okay, so they are the anomalies where everything is bad and then all of sudden you've got something that's just amazing, and a lot of times it was something that already existed, so it was a resource that you already own. I'll give you the example and I'll throw this in for you Dan. So there was this guy, he had to go to some Asian culture, I don't remember where it was, where the children were malnourished, and he had about six weeks in a very minimal budget and had to overhaul it and improve their nutrition. And he was a college, something that was funded through college and so you know he had to succeed with all these limits but what they did is they calmed all the data and they found out that there was one location where the children were actually doing really really well and so they went down there and they observed their daily life and they noticed that the mothers when they were working in the rice fields that they would take the shrimp that they found in the water and added into the kid's rice and so they were getting protein and so the kids were healthier and that actually was available to everybody else in the culture but it wasn't a practice across that that area I don't even remember where it was I wish I did I read it like 10 years ago anyway so that resource was available to everybody but only one person was using it so they didn't need a new budget they just needed to tell people use what's in front of you put it in the rice give it to your kids they'll be better you may boom right so it already existed so my point is that if we can get better data, even more deeper data stuff that we've never even thought about really looking into, because it was a pain in the and Mark doesn't like pain in the is data. I just had this conversation with the other person like I don't want to do that. Anyway, um, friends go figure. Anyway, um, then we can figure out where are the bright spots in sweet loss. Like, is there something that Samantha does on calls that makes her even better? Um, I think that there's going to be more that we can figure out. And if we can figure out how to safely, ethically reliable, reliably get AI into, listen to these calls and give us some kind of info. That would be, we could really improve and up level all of your existing people. with feedback from what's already happening inside this route. I wore myself out talking too much. But anyway, hopefully that was useful. Dan, you're quiet. Are you in a rabbit hole?
00:29:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, I'm like sitting here going, I think I could build a demand rider right now with high level. I think because you don't need, you don't. So right now we, for the AI bot that closes people into appointments, we've trained it. So it has this massive prompt that it's always referencing, but the prompt is in a document. So that's the data storage example that I was getting earlier. Here, it's just, I don't know if it's a text file. can't remember. But, and then we let it round. And then we massaged it based on the outcome, we said, oh, don't do that, do this, don't do that. So now I'm like, okay, we just sort of mapped out the parameters. Obviously, it's not exactly right, but it's in the neighborhood. There's not that many. So it's like, okay, you had a form and then you, the form had these elements in it. And then you said, you just have someone fill out that form. Again, it's just all going to be about the prompt. So if I fill out that form and I send it to the prompt, what do I get at the output, right? And that's a very, like, we don't need a production ready, passable, blah, blah. What's the point in doing all that if it doesn't work, right? are around the sizzle. Hey, we're going to go build a business around this sizzle. But... If the stake is no good, I don't care how easily it is. And that's, what are the odds, right? That, I mean, I can tell you right now, I'd be willing to bet a lot that none of these companies have a pre-lit lawyer at the helm saying that's a good demand, right? And let's face facts. What do you need at the end? You need a good demand. What's a good demand? The one that gets you more money than the demand, right? They don't even have a comparative, but they don't know good from bad. It's like, well, I met with the absurdly guys and they were telling me, which we need to talk about them later, they had what might be another Arizona firm backed by P.E. Money that they sold a thousand leads to. But let's say their leads are $250 a piece, which they may or may not be. can't remember their present. So they dropped 250. Yeah, they drop this, this firm, whoever they are, drop $250,000. And then they were like to add sardly. How do we know this is working? Come again. You guys don't know what to do. So then the ads are like, well, you know, you're going to want to look at how many you convert to a retainer, like, what is that blah blah blah. is over the course of like two or three months, and then they pulled the plug and they said, okay, we're going to stop and we're going to evaluate and see what the outcome is. Pardon, your outcome is not coming for about six more months.
00:32:41 - mark sweet (3)
FYI.
00:32:42 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
If you're lucky, if you have lawyers. So clearly, nobody in that project was an actual personal injury lawyer, ever worked in a law firm, any idea how these things go. So they just see, oh, sizzle, can have non lawyer. partners. Let's go. Woohoo. Then they would say I stuff, right? So all you really need to do is just, it's all about the prompt. The prompt will be is the ultimate piece of IP. It's not chat TPT.
00:33:15 - mark sweet (3)
Anyone can access that.
00:33:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's the piece in the middle. And having a good demand as an example choose to say these guys even know what a good demand is. And then your point, that demand might need to be financed by state, right? You can't just have a demand demand demand demand demand, right? They're not all the same yet. That's how they position it. And then they just slap this huge price tag on it.
00:33:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
None of the sites have pricing on it, which is always a digital way. If you build anything, that's AI related, Dan, and it is prompt related. What I want you to do is build a dummy test scenario that you run through regularly because my experience is that the output is changing. For example, I have a game that I like to play, and I like to get some photographs, and I have a group, whatever. It's my little, it's my little unwind thing. But I noticed that the output of the group was kind of low, so you help people, so you don't have to buy boosters and upgrades to get through things, and I like to do that, whatever. So I started giving stats, and we went from 200 helps a week to 2,000 to 200 helps a week in a matter of like a few weeks, because they gave people stats. But anyway, I use AI to screenshot all of the players and their rankings and their helps, and it did it really well in the beginning, and now I'm having an issue with the same exact prompt and the same exact data, getting it to give me the same kind of report. So what that alerted me to is that I need to have a test prompt and a test result, right? So if I ask you to do this, I expect a specific type of output. If I give you the same exact prompt every single time, I should get something within 99% of the same kind of output. Because if you're building, let's say, a demand writer, and you give it the parameters, and all of a sudden the algorithm in the background changes. And now, or, and this is what I actually think happened, more, what's the word, the law changes, and they just can find what it can do? If the parameters change in the algorithm, if anything changes in the algorithm, then it would change your output. So, but they're not going to tell you that this happened. Even if they tell you there's changes, whatever. or people are going to pay attention to it. So what I think that you should have, if you have anything that's AI based, is a test that says, you know, if I give you this, you output this, it's the same every time. So make sure that you're still getting the same kind of function.
00:36:14 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Does that make sense? Yeah.
00:36:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Even on private servers that's still having the same issue. Yeah, because you're hooking it, unless you wrote your own AI, if you're hooking into OpenAI through an API, you're still using their stuff. And if the law has changed, which does happen, legislature changes, know, they can't do, what they can't do, how it can be used ethically, whatever, something can change the way it's able to respond to you, then it may change your output. It may say, well, I ethically can't give you that. And maybe the work around is the way you ask the question. maybe you simply can't get it whatsoever, but either way, if you don't have something to test the quality and go, hey, or maybe you find out that the output hasn't improved with your test, like your dummy test, what you call it? Whatever, prompt. back to checks and balances, if you're using AI, there should be a foundational fundamental, this is my test that you can still do what I've been assuming that you're doing and that you're doing it with the same kind of logic so that you know if the logic has improved or just gotten worse or you know the output has changed. I don't think anybody's thinking about that or building that. I'm sure somebody is, but I haven't heard anybody say it yet, so but we have to take that into account because the outputs do change and there's stuff happening in the programming behind the scenes that they're not going to be like, hey, just you know, you know this.
00:38:00 - mark sweet (3)
One of other hard parts of what we do is the medical side of it. And what I mean by that is we've got to bring all these medical workers together and, um, prelet side, we can redact things that are bad, um, and put it in a way that puts our client in less payroll. Like, I don't know how to train a bot to be able to do that.
00:38:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can. I'm sure there's ways of knowing you know, it's not hard. It's fronting. Okay. I could help you with that.
00:38:28 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Like you can. Turn to do what?
00:38:31 - mark sweet (3)
So we'll have, let's say, hospital records, right? We really just want to only provide the best things. I don't want to be hard to where it says like they're on Matt, um, bad for us. And in pre litigation, we don't have to necessarily share all the records. Okay. pre litigation, we don't. And so a large part of why attorneys are doing the demands in my office, because I won't use records to pull out the bad stuff to hide it.
00:38:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
War games screenshot in my head. play a game. But the reason is though, because chat GPT does have some rules about what it can do ethically, but if you put in the parameter, let's play a game, we're going to role play. This is your role. Your role is to share this information, but to make sure that we never insinuate or allude to drug usage or this or this or this or whatever. You lose the game if you reveal x, y, z, whatever, and that logic can work.
00:39:34 - mark sweet (3)
Okay.
00:39:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, again, it's going to be a matter of like having a stop word sort of library, I can't the word, that, you know, you can start it right off the gate, right, heroin, meth, right, like there's something you're going get, but then you're going to miss one, right? But as long as you can then update that. database or however that record exists, then you'll get to it, right? So it's the path to getting to the right version is just iterative beta testing with yourself, right? So you turn, like how many cases do you settle a month?
00:40:21 - mark sweet (3)
don't even know, I don't pay attention to number.
00:40:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay, so you have 80 examples a month, right? you actually use these demands, you could run 80 demands through this thing, and it's going to learn pretty quick, right? It should learn around, I would say 300, you get about 300 in there, and you should have a statistically significant outcome. Now, it's just a matter of doing, right? You do it and look at it and go, yeah, that's good, that's bad, this part's right, this part's wrong. But it's going to learn through actual real world data, god forbid.
00:41:01 - mark sweet (3)
Like you said a rating and like this one's a two out of ten. This one's an eight out of ten. So that way.
00:41:05 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yep. Yep Yeah, exactly and it's you grade it and then give it feedback what was wrong. This is what was wrong Yeah, this is like I talked to Salco about this months ago once once We got through it. was like, oh wait, this could be done. like it can be done. It just you have to do it Yeah, right. I'm I'm sure if you set up one of these services and then run a demand through what comes out You're gonna be like, this is not great And they'll go oh, we're working on it.
00:41:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're working on it.
00:41:40 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
How are you working on it?
00:41:42 - mark sweet (3)
No, that's literally my concern is this just gonna be what they have which is the same as just a template pulled together, right? my own thing then someone else's right because you need to us Then with their every situation where we can make it like a one butt click from ourselves for us or no
00:42:01 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
probably, but that's like the next level, right? Then you have to go right, sales course app version, but the parts that you would you carry over would be the prompt, right? Then you just have to say, Oh, this, this front end. Let's say the front end is just always a form. Oh, this front end form needs to be a whatever their language is called. I forgot what it's going, but it needs to be a blah, blah, form, but then it's still going to go hit any API for charge, even tea, and then it's going to output it inside of the sales force app. And then probably turn into a PDF or whatever.

And just a reminder, an encouragement, although I think you get excited enough about the stuff that you don't need it, but the habit that we have of iterations and also just so So you start building something knowing it's not the end product. It's. going to change, you're going to have to do some rework, but it's not really rework because it's iterative, because it's going to have been improved, because you will have learned something that it's then a compounding effect of what you started with and a little bit of a tweak, but in terms of like building something and then hooking it into Salesforce, when you try to have a conversation with somebody ambiguously, like there's no nothing really specific and they're just trying to imagine what that looks like, you're dealing with the limitations of their brain, whereas if you have something that already exists, now you're talking to a coder who deals with API, plus who's familiar with Salesforce and what the options are and whatever, then it becomes much easier conversation because you have a foundation to start with. So if you're willing to put the elbow prison and spend some time trying to figure out a base level framework and get it. started what happens is the same thing that happens every time we've created any type of framework around data or systems or whatever is that you look at it and you're like oh I didn't think about this I didn't think about this and it is a revelatory revelatory process that makes everything else easier but usually what happens is people just think it think it think it think it think I'd like to think the solution you can't you create the solution then the real solution presents itself so you're in the position now of just I mean whether it be something that you use to massively leverage sweet law and I say massively but let's think about it on an energy level and also just kind of alleviating what's tedious or minutia for you and for your people when you have the ability to conserve conserve that energy then all that energy gets to put into higher leverage activity so in and of itself Oh, that is a great play, but then if you create a system that is now kind of proprietary system that you can go sell and monetize, but also not just, you know, coldly because you can go make money, but you also go to get to help your friends use a system. And then you find all of the, you know, related type of activities that it can be used for different types of markets, the dog food like there's. Just using AI to analyze and figure out things. I mean, there's, there's so many plays to it if you're willing to sit there and think and work out the solutions like as much time as Dan is spent in high level. And as much time as you spent just researching and marketing and having all these conversations with different people you put all of that together and. Pretty awesome.
00:45:50 - mark sweet (3)
think. Yeah, no, Dan's super anonymous me almost thought this is all, but if we can actually build the stake behind this is all then we've got something.
00:46:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And even if you only use it for yourself, I have many tools that I've built just for me. I enjoy them daily.
00:46:10 - mark sweet (3)
But as you like to say, Dan, what are the hardest people to sell?
00:46:14 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, no, would be, you know, the best products are the ones that solve your own problem, right? And it's not just you know, it's not just your problem, right? And then then you also have tied to that, the whole story brand aspect of, oh, yeah, no, you know, it's trite to say, build for Laurie's bio borders. But in this scenario, it's not, it's not trite. mean, it's, I don't know if that gets used a lot actually in this space, to be honest, but you know, we get built from, built from marketers by marketers, but it's, it's true. And it's like, you know, you could, then you can go into this whole story brand aspect of it. And also results before and after, before. before demand rider, after demand rider, right? Whether it's saving time, it's an increase, like Salco's convinced that you can increase your bottom line through ruptured, like really dialing in the demands.
00:47:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can increase my bottom line.
00:47:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
that's true, if that's true, let's say that does happen, you're also going to free up time for lawyers, which may or may not have a result, but it's quantifiable, right? These are the these are the cornifiable outcomes of this thing.
00:47:40 - mark sweet (3)
So, we just kind of need to pick A-Link to start with, I guess, for lack of a better term, because there's just so many options for where to go, but demands make the most sense.
00:47:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Organizers get them processed, analyze, start there. So, first, it would be getting files that could be fed,
00:48:00 - mark sweet (3)
to AI first securely there is one other thing that I think actually AI can do very very well and it's already somewhat in our system which is pulling by insurance companies and by adjusting their settlements and what total damages are produced damages are to see who we do better with and who we don't do as well with and see if there's anything between doctors we use and don't use yeah I don't have enough data for everything everything but at least we could tell by insurance company and get it started and it's just feeding more data as things go yeah like State Farm I think that now they are very bad State Farm to State Farm things and they're on there we're going to let you get lot of stuff because we're spending too much money which they go every like three to five years between this yeah that was the interest that uh that thing that Josh showed us is doctor thing and then how I when I when he pulled that up I was like wait a second
00:49:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Like he, he's like, oh, you can use this to find doctors, which I thought was interesting, but then he was also saying that it did that. It should, it allowed you to then look at your outcome per doctor. So you could be like, you know what, this doctor doesn't get as good as this doctor. But then you could go back to that tool and be like, I need a new pain management dude in this area. And then all of a sudden, here's the 20 guys in that area.
00:49:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know if anybody remembers somebody was asking about tracking doctors and creating his spreadsheet for that, just so we can get that data. Bring any bells at all. Oh, yeah.
00:49:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So his thing, his thing does it. I also thought it was interesting. Did you catch this mark? was like, hey, wait, what? So he basically was like saying that your firm's bigger than theirs, right?
00:49:55 - mark sweet (3)
That was the bye I was getting yet.
00:49:57 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Didn't he also say that they refer out three?
00:50:00 - mark sweet (3)
hundred cases a month.
00:50:01 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I was like, wait, what?
00:50:03 - mark sweet (3)
Yes. Now, how many hours, how many are actually like retained or referred out? think are different numbers.
00:50:11 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay, yeah, me too. This was the conversation I had with the ads, certainly guys. Yeah. So oh, yeah, back to that. They gave me all the data on this. We'll just say it was the new Arizona firm. They converted 14% of those leagues. But that's with their version of I'm sure those guys were just retainers, right? They're gold. metric is retainers. It's like, no, the metric is cases. They are different.
00:50:42 - mark sweet (3)
No, I could believe if your criteria is crap, then mine, right? have a great tier. I can believe 14% fairly is because we're at what percent would have certainly like five?
00:50:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's everyone's five.
00:50:57 - mark sweet (3)
Right? Right?
00:50:59 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's like that number comes up all
00:51:00 - mark sweet (3)
time. I don't know how to refer it out as how many 10 10 percent.
00:51:06 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:51:07 - mark sweet (3)
So yeah.
00:51:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. So we need to get so we need to get that in place which we talked about before like there's referred out and then we need we need to differentiate with out for referral and then as been referred out because right now it seems like things are referred out but if you pointed out on those three or four that I sent you you're like I don't think anyone's going to take those however the system says refer it out so I'm like we need to change that.
00:51:34 - mark sweet (3)
Oh yeah absolutely no it's still referred out because again we're going find anything from even from the jobs 50 percent if one out of you know 10 they get some money on but still one more that I wouldn't have any money in.
00:51:47 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well yeah the quick math we did a couple of weeks ago was it's five grand so it's like okay five grand you know nothing especially if it's just a phone call but if you were to go in right now and say refer it out times 5,000, that would be a false number. It's not really that. So, I actually talked to Isaac about that. He's going through the Salesforce course. He's learning some things.
00:52:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, speaking of Josh, what does he have for us in reports right now? You were saying that he could do the...
00:52:20 - mark sweet (3)
We had a really cool meeting that you're going to like, but he needs a little time to put it together.
00:52:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I heard about it. I'm really upset I didn't get to be there.
00:52:27 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Listen, it was I don't meet with him ever. So super, he was like, can we do it Thursday? I was like, uh, okay. But normally it's all email. It's not face to face. Or zoom or anything. And it's actually normally it's email through Stacy.
00:52:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't even email him. No recording.
00:52:52 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I don't get to hear all the smart stuff. You don't.
00:52:56 - mark sweet (3)
I'm sorry. I like the end result of it.
00:52:59 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So that's a good part.
00:53:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like the conversations because then my brain goes, whoa, this is good.
00:53:05 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay, fine. He knows this for sure.
00:53:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but here's the thing. He's the guy who has access to all the data I have been asking for for years.
00:53:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Some of it.
00:53:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:53:19 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
For sure.
00:53:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Either way, it's just I decided to see.
00:53:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, yeah, you have to his thing builds it. So that data doesn't really exist with his add on. It can. So it's like he, he has two apps that he, I guess, sells. don't know. He didn't actually get it. He did not try to sell us on them at all, which was also funny. He just showed to show them to us and he's like, nerding out on them. I like, yeah, but it's kind of interesting. I suppose we could ask him how much the app is.
00:53:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It might be it. Could you do that and ask him to like. I'm gonna tape a demo and let's just hope that he just gets really geeky in there.
00:54:04 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, he will.
00:54:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, he will.
00:54:06 - mark sweet (3)
thinking about this though.
00:54:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Let's see. Oh, yeah.
00:54:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, will you ask for that?
00:54:14 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm already doing it.
00:54:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. Okay. This is gonna be fun. See that and somebody who is excited to go create it and get it for us. I mean, you guys, that's a golden kiss right there. Golden Goose. Okay. Um, uh, down you said you needed to talk about the answer to the guys, but was that what you just talked about? Also, yay for record month.
00:54:45 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, that's good. I was not outrageous. So what was not outrageous? Or spend like we didn't over spend to try to get to that number.
00:54:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What did you spend?
00:54:58 - mark sweet (3)
I don't have the final number. Because they're still adding stuff into the system. So like the very, very rough number. Was. About 420 case spent.
00:55:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And.
00:55:23 - mark sweet (3)
The other week or so we should have the final final numbers, but it looks like it should be around that. Numbers are going to go down and it'll just go up. So it might be, you know, instead of 4,100, 4,250, which is still a lot better than where we were.
00:55:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, would you divide that by incident or people incident. Okay. Okay.
00:55:49 - mark sweet (3)
If I'm trying to sell or from trying to like position myself, I do it obviously by people because it looks better and how 99% of firms look at things. I just don't look at that way from the market. Because again, it's one call, it's not three different calls, right?
00:56:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:56:08 - mark sweet (3)
Um, and they also include their drops and subouts and then try to pull those out as well. Because if we kept those numbers, if we look by person and by drops of outs, then we're at 126, that brings the number down to, you know, 33, which is a significant difference from 4,100.
00:56:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's, I mean, that's really good. Yes. And your subout rate, what we haven't done, which I want to do when we're starting to track it, is just kind of figure out what that percentage is, 8% roughly, right now. But I'm tracking it over time.
00:57:01 - mark sweet (3)
I mean, in this case, it was just, there was one set out where someone signed with three firms in total. Um, I mean, the drops, I put the reasons why all of them in total sense. Um, you know, one, maybe we could have done a better job of the upfront just to try to keep them with their response. If everything else was, you know, a pretty good reason, um, you know, stopping right after a setup. So we need to figure out, is there something better once they sign an agreement to get them to feel better with us? And both those were HQ intakes. So I need to see what we can do to shore that up. I don't know if the HQ intakes do it in Vegas. The guy who runs it's about four, uh, five foot two.
00:57:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not so bad. Hey, that's a good height.
00:57:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
For a guy. Mm hmm.
00:57:51 - mark sweet (3)
who? ball guy with mustache.
00:57:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or Portuguese girl.
00:57:54 - mark sweet (3)
Okay. Okay. Um, because you're coping. Myers is trying to buy all their leads. California, because they have a lead generation business goes with it. They're doing that nationwide, but they're having issues and having to like fire some clients. They like to work with us because we're relatively easy to work with and we get in the answer to the phone. We actually follow up. So. I'm trying to steer away from them saying everything Jacoby is obviously one more. Their cost is 3,500 per retainer. including their cost.
00:58:26 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's not. It's not late.
00:58:27 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:58:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So their lead to they close it themselves. Correct. Oh. Have you seen what? Well, you've gotten it, but it's not. You've already seen what they signed. Right. So what percentage.
00:58:45 - mark sweet (3)
And I see you respond to them.
00:58:47 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:58:48 - mark sweet (3)
It doesn't seem very. I say 10% we say, what did you sign this?
00:58:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Exactly. So I was going to say probably still about 10% right. So they're not. Cucouville as far as signing the wrong stuff.
00:59:05 - mark sweet (3)
Now, can I get the price point? may make sense, but I don't know.
00:59:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, it's going to. Yeah, let's say, yeah, if it puts it up at 4,500, remember, um, could score work.
00:59:18 - mark sweet (3)
Look, in special outcomes.
00:59:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Analyzing as a vendor.
00:59:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:59:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so just will just will have the per vendor. That's what I was going to ask.
00:59:34 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, we're doing per vendor per state, and then we're checking the ROA all the way through to see what our ROI is on each source.
00:59:41 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:59:43 - mark sweet (3)
But then hopefully we also add on per attorney. So we'll see which attorneys doing what.
00:59:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, understand you guys all like want growth and they don't get excited about anything and really celebrate the win. That's a big celebration.
00:59:58 - mark sweet (3)
And then you should celebrate with your whole team and tell them. They're reading large bonuses this month so i'm already um super thrilled about spending more money.
01:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean that's not the only way to celebrate you can just oh i need to schedule another like follow-up meeting with you too. I want to do that.
01:00:16 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah almost sixty two thousand dollars this past month on bonuses which is a lot.
01:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a lot um yeah but you don't have to just use money to thank people.
01:00:30 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah people like money.
01:00:32 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
They do like money but they also like praise.
01:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They do in LA. They also like praise and knowing especially yours.
01:00:41 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah they also like money.
01:00:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh whatever. Okay um so we spend a lot of time talking about the AI stuff just one other Just want to start getting up over one because it's going to take a lot of time to get it right.
01:00:55 - mark sweet (3)
Like it's not this is not okay. By next week we got a process. That'd be cool but. that's not yeah likely um but in every case that we get the policy limit on meaning we get the most amount um circling those to feed because we always want to give chat sheet see the best data although guess we can say hey oh void writing demands like this as well yes you so you want to a high low yeah yeah for sure and it's worth all the effort to organize that data to feed it correctly and then give it the parameters and really have um measure the output based off of the prompt there's there's a lot of leg work to do but then once you do it it goes really fast so um i mean i think that's really it uh is there anything else that we should discuss rather um then try to start any new conversations right now that was a good conversation and especially because
01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we're leverage and optimization, which is really the overarching, you know, target that we have the most out of the least.
01:02:08 - mark sweet (3)
So we can go with Dan, you know, there's more money to be made for Dan and for me, for the separate side projects that are not just the law for themselves. And I want to make Dan and myself lots of extra money.
01:02:20 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So, you know, there you go.
01:02:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll just watch.
01:02:24 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, look, this is the doctor run, right?
01:02:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
doctor notes like I'm down for it. I got lots of time to work.
01:02:32 - mark sweet (3)
So yeah, I want to hire a teen and make her my money too. She's not.
01:02:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, okay. So is there anything that's pressing anything that we should know or just to bring that for an agenda for next week? On either side.
01:02:54 - mark sweet (3)
And this month, I'll be waved into Colorado and to We don't have anybody in Colorado to do it. We have both Fuji and agape.
01:03:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no, I'm an attorney.
01:03:11 - mark sweet (3)
Like you're the only one that we able to do Colorado. Yeah, the same way we do like Washington right now.
01:03:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just saying cuz like somebody's already in New Mexico, but not you.
01:03:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So I'm asking Colorado is open for the Colorado's mark and mark AI.
01:03:26 - mark sweet (3)
Here we go. Yeah, no Colorado is we're trying to. haven't done anything with it yet. Um, although thing of it, the dude who was selling like coaching, he did like a really crappy job with Andy Stickel on the other dude. I don't remember who that is. Anyway, they connected with the guy in Colorado who just does a bunch of billboards, but doesn't want to actually work, and wants to spend all his time in Italy. So, yeah, maybe they'll be in part of connection there, but I don't know.
01:03:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, anything else?
01:04:00 - mark sweet (3)
Talk to Tom and the CAMG people about potentially doing boards into Mexico because that may not be the worst place to start and start getting like our message a little bit clearer and our feet under us to some level. That's just one thing we really haven't done much of any on is, you know, traditional.
01:04:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I would love to see the valiant breakdown by state.
01:04:31 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, it was actually kind of interesting. No Washington, despite generating a decent number of Washington leads in no California.
01:04:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, how much of New Mexico was him.
01:04:49 - mark sweet (3)
I'll tell you right now because he had asked him the same thing and to do the breakdown form. So that was for Missouri, five New Mexico for Washington. Sorry, no Arizona, that was not Washington, Arizona, that was weird.
01:05:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or Missouri, what?
01:05:10 - mark sweet (3)
Or Missouri, five New Mexico, Washington. But he generated a decent number of Arizona leads, just not an abandoned anything.
01:05:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where do the rest of the New Mexico ones come from?
01:05:26 - mark sweet (3)
Three came from Quantify. One came from Felipe, one came from Monkey, five from Valiant, three from Walker.
01:05:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was just asking because for the longest time in Mexico was averaging like two, and then we jumped up all of a sudden, just a few months ago to six, and now we've got thirteen. I mean, those retainers, that that trajectory is impressive.
01:05:56 - mark sweet (3)
It's quantifying Valiant, those are the two that really made the difference.
01:06:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
before quantifies Ben and quite frankly pretty good find thanks for mustache guy yeah like I said he never know so we're like him sort mustache guy yeah that's a case HQ but who found them case HQ on case HQ no case HQ came from case connect guys yeah and then case HQ referred quantified and who did case connection guys come from me that was the pedigree before it was me yes okay okay it was me for being on Facebook sort of case Nick was an absolute monetary failure for us that's okay they saw
01:07:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you have to look at the pedigree, you have to look at the little chart there, it matters, cause and effects, everything.
01:07:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, I mean, that is good point, right? It's like, some, right, it's not a fail, it wasn't a, it was a lesson, right? wasn't a failure in one respect, but then it's like led to this and led to this.
01:07:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It had a return, even if the return was indirect.
01:07:25 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, and then other people won't do it, right? That's like, that's what the ads are dealing with right now. All these firms they call, they're like, please stop calling me.
01:07:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, yeah, I'll bet. Also, this goes into the practice, which we intentionally and purposely have, which is exploring all the vendors. right. Yeah, exactly. that they're going to be crap and knowing that even if they are crap, sometimes there's a tangent that is valuable to us and, but look at, I mean, record number, When we started your low 30s, mid 30s, and now you're here, and one of the practices is exploring all the vendors, having all the conversations, and it is tedious, and it is risky, and some of them don't pan out. But because of the relationships in those conversations, and the secondary and tertiary conversations that happen as a result of the first one, look at where you're at now, all these different sources, just the change in power and who's bringing what across the state, it's just, I just want to pay attention to the practices and the value of that, because it's important.
01:08:43 - mark sweet (3)
So monkeys back to where it shouldn't be, because they did concerned over last month, obviously, because the numbers didn't make sense.
01:08:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Also, I feel like you leave You you manage the vendors better. I feel like you were a little bit more reactive before you didn't know your numbers, you weren't on top of them and you were hesitant to want to have conversations with them. I think you felt like they had a little bit more power over you than the other way around the dynamic has shifted and all of that has happened mostly. Here's the thing. The other thing about data that people don't really notice is that it creates a level of confidence in you know what you know. And so you do what you do even better, and that adds to more confidence and it's a compounding effect too but when you negotiate with people confidently their outcome is very different. So, anyway, all of that just takes into account. So, just wanted to point it out.
01:09:52 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, I just got to repeat it and beat it. think we're tenors out for next month already so that's good.
01:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good September. I can.
01:10:00 - mark sweet (3)
That's all right. Yeah. Well, I dropped for it. That's fine. So we'll repeat it again, which is good. And then starting soon, have Yuri. He's a lot of Thark joining us. So he's a Ukrainian Lot Thark dude and he's going to be taking the bar in February.
01:10:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And where's he going to fit?
01:10:23 - mark sweet (3)
So when he starts, we just have him do demands because I think it's going to start getting too busy. can do more as a demands. A lot of us quit with his to help Lorenz. He has a very large support system, but we're trying to see if can create another Patrick for lack of a better term where hey, this is kind of good. And you know, short term rental, I guess is the best way to think about it. You get a chance to see the lawyer be it be like in baseball, right? like, oh, it's a mid season pick up, but then like they're down the end of the season. We like to do not like anything. And so if he's a great film another Patrick, he's not great. We'll just say, hey, know, our perfect time done.
01:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Goodbye. I love that.
01:11:02 - mark sweet (3)
I love that as a problem process to build them up. this is a long term commitment, but but it's not with no without anything because he's doing some work.
01:11:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and it's the and also that's easier than going out and just trying to hire anybody because that doesn't go well.
01:11:23 - mark sweet (3)
We're having much more difficult time with it. So it makes more sense to build these people internally or I'll do both quite frankly, where we can find them. We just have to keep an eye on our payroll because that's a lot.
01:11:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is the guy who just like keeps throwing out bonus and left and right.
01:11:40 - mark sweet (3)
That's Mary more than me, but yeah.
01:11:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, okay. Well, Mary.
01:11:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think we need to start having some other conversations.
01:11:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Mary's nickname is money fairy.
01:11:51 - mark sweet (3)
Maybe you didn't know this. Look, we started. That's what I was going to say. You know, if the teams have their goals. to help them do more than push them and do more. So, you know, hey, and those are high numbers. think maybe.
01:12:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
But here's the question. Here's the real question. Are these numbers a result of that or not? Because you're for sure related. But right.
01:12:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
to what degree?
01:12:26 - mark sweet (3)
Right. I think what's going to be more on the money in than on the settlements themselves because the teams while they do have some controller getting, you know, records and whatnot. I'm sure they feel more like the attorneys are responsible for that. On the money in, you know, maybe something like the teams like the case manager is sitting around like, how close are we, how close are we to see what else they can push to try to get that extra money in.
01:12:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's the thing though. It's the amount that will make the biggest impact to you that actually almost makes the least impact to them. So psychologically. If there is a bonus for a thing, it's not necessarily that that bonus has to be a certain number. It just has to be there There's a potential that you're overpaying. So like on the line item for how you can earn the money Taking that back not necessarily you can't take anything back. Anyway, this is a whole big long conversation But my point is is that a lot of times a five dollar Not talking about your attorney your your your attorneys your team But it's somebody just getting an unexpected or an earned extra a small amount Versus a large amount that the happiness level is almost equal. They're obviously our gaps, right? But my point is that To get the lift that you need you probably don't have to give the lifts that you're giving so There is some math to be figured out there, but again you have an existing team Zisting expectations pulling back and then you have have to look at what's available in the market. There's a lot of numbers to crunch.
01:14:04 - mark sweet (3)
And that's probably what it comes to the market, where we can do these interviews, what people want, is more than what we're paying our current people for lower quality.
01:14:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:14:14 - mark sweet (3)
So this is the way to bridge that gap to some level.
01:14:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's entirely possible that it's a very, very good system. And so then the other way to leverage your money is to be able to use things like the AI to have them doing less of the tedious stuff. So they're doing more of the money-making activities. So with the same amount of staff, you're getting more money. You're also paying more bonuses. But that still should be maybe it's not a higher percentage of profit margins, but an overall higher bottom line. Then you're still winning the game.
01:14:51 - mark sweet (3)
So I think that's issue for me. is that I wanted an achievable because I hated, hated, hated working for people where the goal is just not realistic.
01:15:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. You feel like you're being set up to fail?
01:15:09 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. But I think it may actually be a little low because I shouldn't be breaking even every month if they hit their goal.
01:15:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Like that's not right.
01:15:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Exactly. So what kind of How can we visually see this data of what comes in and I have to think about, you know, what I would want to see, but all the different types of bonuses, what all the goals are, who hits them, how they hit them, what it costs you, aside from the bonuses is, you know, the working net revenue up until payroll and bonuses so that we can see that correlation and and look at the performance over time.
01:16:03 - mark sweet (3)
I can't, I'm kind of fried right now, but the most person they got and go through, but you know, again, these are good problems to have right in their goals and in their expectations.
01:16:13 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That's definitely not a bad thing. Oh, I got something. I talked to your boy, Salco. I forget when, but I forget when, but because I didn't answer the phone for a couple days, because I was doing a bunch of with my parents, but uh, so he was saying, and I thought this was interesting because I was like, okay, yeah, I never thought about that. He was saying how he just settled a dog bite through you or whatever, in your, in your firm, I think, for like 75 grand. He's like, yeah, just settled a dog bite for 75 grand. And I was like, okay. And he's like, can any of these vendors generate dog bite leads? And I was like, I don't know, like I never, I've never done it. I've never asked them. I've also never seen it. So I, when I I was talking to Ed, certainly, on my bi-weekly call that I have with them, for whatever reason. I brought it up with them, and the guy was like, really? I go, And he goes, I've never seen anybody do that. go, neither have I. So then he starts researching. He goes, dude, there's nine million dog mike. And he just starts rattling off all the data. And I go, And he's like, why doesn't anybody do this? go, I don't know. I go because lawyers, copy lawyers, copy lawyers. And I go, do you think you could generate them? He goes, yeah. And so when I was talking to South, I go, what's the criteria? And he goes, I mean, you know, that route lost some . And what I heard was, did you get bit a dog? Do you know who the homeowner is? Did you get medical assistance? Medical treatment. That's it. That's it. That's a lead. So I was like, yeah, that would be a lead. Oh, okay. That's a simple form, right? They just fill that out. So then it just becomes a math problem. What's the cost per lead? So if you say, cost per unit is x, convergent is five, right? We always know it's five from internet, basically. Then, and then average case value, you might not have enough data for that. But I go, okay, that's interesting. Like you could do that, but now you're talking about diversifying your case load, right? So everyone's going out to car accidents. You add this into the mix. got it. Now, hold on. You got car accidents and dog bites. Then you're also adding into the mix. Well, now they've had a lawyer with suite law. And when they get, when they get in a car accident, they're going to call a suite. Yep, and the referrals. So now all of sudden you're adding new nodes to your network. I was like, okay, that's interesting. And then it's a different demand, right? So it's like, okay, do you have a good dog bite demand? Sounds like Salko maybe had a good one. have no idea. But I was like, okay, that's interesting. And these guys were like, I can't find one. ad for this. That's it. I can't explain it to you, but I've never done it. Doesn't mean you should.
01:19:07 - mark sweet (3)
One really big difference between a couple between dog biting car accident.
01:19:12 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:19:13 - mark sweet (3)
The drop rate is massively higher on dog bite because a lot of people don't have insurance.
01:19:21 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. Exactly. So the qualifier, so the 5% might be too in actuality, right?
01:19:29 - mark sweet (3)
So if you if you bake it in a 50% drop rate, you get into the case because that's what I'm saying. So your drop rate is 40% plus.
01:19:38 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So if you model it at 50, can you even model it out, right? So if you say, okay, going to get, you're going to get, it's $250 a lead, you're going to convert five, and then, and then half of those are going to drop. They probably going to be cheaper, right? Yeah. So I was like, all right. And so the ads certainly guys are looking at it. They're like, wait. this is a thing. I go, it is a thing. I just don't know if it's a thing that works. And they're like, all right, this is interesting.
01:20:10 - mark sweet (3)
And of course, for them, talk about you get decent money on, especially when you talk about minor children getting bit, like we've gotten.
01:20:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That's the other thing, it's mostly children that get bit just to do sports a lot. No, according to the stats, I don't know if it's truly true.
01:20:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We have a little girl that lives up the street. She got mauled so bad. She doesn't have hair anymore because they she got attacked by two governments and they they chewed up her scout like she shouldn't be alive. She had multiple surgeries.
01:20:43 - mark sweet (3)
It was right. And so if there's insurance on the homeowner, that's, you know, $500 million case.
01:20:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yep.
01:20:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
01:20:52 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
They got nothing. So those get so you're not totally against this idea, then?
01:20:57 - mark sweet (3)
I'm not totally against the idea because be significantly cheaper for a commitment.
01:21:03 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I would imagine.
01:21:04 - mark sweet (3)
So yeah, exactly. But I'm not against the idea because the criteria is, did you get that yes, and then get scarring photos, basically, would like show me the bite because you've got people that it's like, you know, a scratch, like it's what I got. Oh, there you go.
01:21:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:21:18 - mark sweet (3)
But dog bites, especially California, it's there's no one bike for you. think Arizona law is a little different.
01:21:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Did you just say one bite free?
01:21:27 - mark sweet (3)
So Arizona kind of has that role, actually.
01:21:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
You're kidding. You had to have to be a second offense, like second strike.
01:21:35 - mark sweet (3)
Unless, you know, a dog with dangerous propensity. Yeah. wow.
01:21:40 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. And they were like, we could do California. OK, that would actually be the perfect and biggest population, all that good stuff, man.
01:21:49 - mark sweet (3)
Because you got some plastic assertions and stuff like that.
01:21:51 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So California would definitely be.
01:21:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. yeah.
01:21:55 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
01:21:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah. Well, I think the other thing is the system, whatever system. some you create like a could do you have access to or would a private investigator or if you hire them have access to like if you get they say yes I know the homeowner this is where they live this is their information where they could go say we know that they have insurance is it a record that a specific entity would have access to no you can hire a investigation companies it just but they're not the best in that regard I mean you send letters the worst case you file lawsuit and discover you find out pretty quickly and you just learn they have nothing and it's kind of a whatever but so if you wrote it all up it's basically here's the boxes this is what has to happen this is this is how long this would take this is what this process would look like so that and then do a rough forecasted like if we were able to get leads at this cost the percentage that have insurance, don't have insurance, the estimated value like I just did a quick search and it says 4.5 million people have been a Forbes report for last year, per year, 800,000 only must seek medical attention of those. Do they know, you know, how much is that is just little stitches or go away? There's nothing like there's so much data to go get and then plug in those numbers and then how much does it take? But even if it added, you know, $50,000,,000 to your gross revenue, that revenue, whatever, all those numbers, you could spend a day or two doing the research and find out if it's even viable, but if it's viable and you've got...
01:23:45 - mark sweet (3)
It's It's viable. Generally, also need to try to target more affluent areas.
01:23:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You don't want to target like combat. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:23:54 - mark sweet (3)
That's the big difference for the lead generation.
01:23:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They usually just do state wide and if you live or die by it's an area.
01:24:00 - mark sweet (3)
is where you just, you know, damn well, they don't have anything.
01:24:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:24:04 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So you're not targeting Compton. I got you're in Compton.
01:24:07 - mark sweet (3)
You're going to target more like Vermont.
01:24:09 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:24:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, okay. Um, else that needs to be talked about this week or tabled for brought up for next week to talk about?
01:24:23 - mark sweet (3)
You know, I mean, I buy things definitely in Avenue. Um, because it's easy to train. like, did you get bit by dog? Yes. Okay. You theoretically have a case like it's not.
01:24:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's also it's another way that you're using your existing resources. So it's getting more out of what you have. And that is leverage. Yeah. That's what we want more of that. Okay.
01:24:46 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. That's a back then.
01:24:55 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
But yeah. Oh, yeah.
01:24:57 - mark sweet (3)
I know. Yeah. That's coming. Yeah. Just as a quick heads up. that's one word for it.
01:25:05 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Um, but yeah, he died when, like today. Yeah. Yeah. That's what him and I were talking about that. He's like, he was like, I don't understand like what he thinks is going on. Like he's kept saying his dad thinks he's going to be doing this and doing that. I was like, dude, nobody, nobody, like, we're all on the same path. We're all on a path to the end. Of course, we're not sitting there going hope it ends.
01:25:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My mom is.
01:25:39 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, is true. And they and they accelerate that for them.
01:25:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know.
01:25:47 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, not recommended.
01:25:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not recommended. They're miserable. And they spread them as a read.
01:25:54 - mark sweet (3)
But you had something. All right. We're situation.
01:25:59 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, for sure.
01:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right guys, till next week.

Okay, can you hear me?
00:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, can you hear me? How are you doing?
00:00:11 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Getting a little tired of all the body blows. Gotta be honest. Been a lot of stuff for the last two or three weeks.
00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's going on?
00:00:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
We have the Washington Bar Company, the New Mexico lawsuit in Bar Company. Tyler potentially missing the statue. Tyler slash Nate slash cat. Potentially missing the statue. Friday getting an earful from Sweet James because they also signed the client of ours and got mad that we were trying to write their name when that wasn't the case, so we're hearing that out at 12 today, but that's a minimum $200,000 loss for me, which sucks. It is what it is. And we kind of like... The survey cases that are relatively new, email us, tell us that they don't want to be represented in. And what about HQ intake? We're still sending our leads to HQ intake and they're going to us, so we're doing double work. So it's just getting the point where it's a lot.
00:01:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, what's good?
00:01:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Um, great to have a big check last month. That's always good. We've signed up a good number of cases last month, despite having a lot of drops and subouts, so that's still good. We put together a new incentive plan that we rolled out to the staff, so it should be good. Obviously, it costs us money, but hopefully we'll get everyone incentivized to try to get the goals together. Oh, I took a new job with a pain doctor, so that'll be good for her. And yeah, that's what I got.
00:02:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tell me about the incentive plan, and is that going to increase payroll?
00:02:35 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. By about 15 grand a month.
00:02:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A percentage is that.
00:02:46 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Payroll or.
00:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Total so payroll was around 37% what's it now?
00:02:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't have last month number yet. Because it's on the bed, so there's still. I know that her payroll last month was really high and give you a rough estimate of what it was.
00:03:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:03:48 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, we also have someone trying to commit fraud against her trust account. So that's cool. Sorry, Arizona. Trying to pay their gas belt with our. Where they're trusted, yeah.
00:04:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:04:10 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Awesome.
00:04:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's. Okay. Okay.
00:04:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay, we were. California was two. Seventy eight before taxes and everything else. They were buying good taxes. Oh, the employee benefits, Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. And You $409,113.
00:06:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What was your revenue for July?
00:06:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
$1.1. $1. $1. So, I'm, is this short?
00:07:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, now we're 40 percent and when did that get rolled out?
00:07:40 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Thursday. So, yeah, sign in this.
00:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's, what's changed in the structure?
00:08:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
They hit both money angle and settlements, it's a thousand of each person. If they want hit one of them, it's 500.
00:08:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One of the stats on hitting those goals across the teams.
00:08:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It hit it three or four months this year. It's not every time, but it's frequent enough that it's not impossible, I guess. It's definitely doable. I think done it multiple times. Thanks
00:09:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I don't think that that's, I think it's a good thing to me. I mean, obviously, you did too because you did it, but that makes sense to me, that I mean, I guess it just depends on how much revenue difference that makes money and goals and settlement.
00:09:30 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What's the settlement goal? Three million.
00:09:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:09:36 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
The logic is not every case that settles you're going to paid out right away, just because it takes We made it clear that the goals will increase over time. Right. We're adding more people. or adding more states, writing more cases, like it's not going to stay this way.
00:10:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Will the payment increase or just the expectations?
00:10:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I think just the expectations because quite frankly, for adding more people and more teams, it's hard to justify increasing the amount per person when we're adding more people. It doesn't make sense.
00:10:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Talking to, I assume that you would have had a conversation with your attorneys about this. So wait, let me ask this first of all, in Patrick's team probably won't even have enough to get to those goals. It's a real wide goal. And then the attorneys that are already paying out of pocket for their teams for their incentive program or are they going to Okay, this what?
00:11:02 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
This is separate from that.
00:11:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What I what I was asking is, would you think that they're going to pull back what they're already doing or keep that the same?
00:11:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I've talked to them and they've all said they're going to keep the same.
00:11:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so who does that besides Samantha and Marin's?
00:11:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Nick doesn't because it doesn't really make sense given their volume. Patrick isn't on a percentage. So it wouldn't make sense for him to do it and Hank doesn't. Again, a percentage to noon.
00:11:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. This doesn't take away from them. I wouldn't see why they would do it other than just being short-sighted and thinking that that would be How much do they pay out, do you know individually each month to their teams and internet programs?
00:12:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know exactly. Sam's a little better because she gives part of her quarterly bonus to them. She has 6,000 divided by her team and she'll pull us out like during the month. Tyler is more ad hoc. I think he's probably giving his team a round of grand that total.
00:12:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so the people I have on Samantha's team is Thelma, Valerie, Victoria, and Jalissa.
00:12:43 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
that still correct? No, Jalissa never wanted, never ended moving over. She made more money doing it and take the script.
00:12:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so does she only have three people?
00:12:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
She's got Liz helping her a little bit. we've got Liz training with her before that is kind of cool. time would think.
00:13:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And in what role? Can you send it right?
00:13:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Sure.
00:13:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. Just helping. Yeah. I was Hank doing.
00:13:29 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Um, we've got a standing meeting every Wednesday to go through his cases and what's going on. So I talked a little bit on Wednesday last week, um, going through his cases, kind of how these are built. New cases look okay. he's just trying to scrape some of these, you know, crack their cases through. Uh, he had, not a complaint, but, you know, said it was a little tough with him in the same office, even though the office is made for four people. Um, just because sometimes they're working around. each other and we get a little loud if they're both on the phone, so we end up just getting her a separate office. They're on like a scene like what they're near each other.
00:14:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's that gonna cost you different?
00:14:24 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
600 bucks a month. It's not enough to worry about to keep two people happy. I would agree. One thing he did say, which I did find interesting and was actually kind of also anyway, he said that clients have been showing up to the office, like they want to come in more. And so I was talking to Steve, he's like, yeah, our Phoenix office, like clients love to come in. Like it's weird, no other place they do that, but in the Phoenix area they love to come in. So, I think longer term is actually a good thing having a Phoenix office, so it should help us with retention and hopefully with the hurdles.
00:15:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or be more of a bottleneck because it slows things down and people get more chatty. That be interesting to see if there's less sub-out or if there's more referrals from the Phoenix office from previous customers, things like that, would be really interesting to see how, what the correlations are to anything, very interesting, so let me go look at this. Pink's not even on the team, and I look at matters by team, hold on, yeah, that's this year.
00:16:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So, because we started to give them about one or two new cases a week.
00:16:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What was the first thing you said before giving one or two?
00:16:23 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You have some because it's getting one or two weeks, so it definitely has cases.
00:16:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So. Screen to real quick. So this is one of the newer reports that. Did he actually say is the newest report I think. So I don't know how accurate this is or. it was made from zoom out of the way more. Okay, so these are the teams, it's finding, how would I see what criteria this report is using? If I edit, maybe.
00:17:21 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And it's probably not going to the resolution closed because he's just starting to get his own cases.
00:17:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So, let's see, okay, so it probably just wouldn't even be in here.
00:17:38 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Also, it looks like he doesn't have his own matter team as he's principal, so I'll talk about that.
00:17:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Oh. Got that.
00:17:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. So, if you wanted to, like, map.
00:18:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
as a report?
00:18:04 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, just letter in general.
00:18:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, sorry, where do you mean?
00:18:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
There's home, chatter. Oh, yeah.
00:18:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:18:15 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And then I recently viewed if you just click where it says you're telling you to left.
00:18:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
00:18:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And then just type in hang. Yep. You can see his list.
00:18:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. So he's got a 50. And status, no.
00:18:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Yeah, they're not using that thing. Progatory was what was supposed to be for soccer to take a look at.
00:18:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just think it's funny.
00:19:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
the file but the offers aren't good enough to take so it's okay.
00:19:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, just making it this. I haven't like did this report like this before so that was interesting. All right, so we can probably stop screen sharing and hey, have you heard from Fuji today?
00:19:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Today?
00:19:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Well, he, oh, okay, he slept through his alarms.
00:19:42 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He missed my call, so.
00:19:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, you baby. Yeah, I'm not mad about it. figured I just wanted to make sure it wasn't something bad. So, you know, mean, new babies are something.
00:19:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
We talked to him again because he got his car. He was doing drier than having fun.
00:19:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, No, and I heard from him yesterday, but he he messaged that he just messaged. I just thought that he slept through his alarm. So it's okay. I'll check in with him. just want to make sure they were okay. So, um, okay, so new incentive program. That's good. You about how are I said, how are you doing? And you're like, okay, body blows, all that stuff. overall, really, how do you feel Um, trying to think of how to formulate that question right now, it just feels little demoralizing, right?
00:20:39 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's just like, you keep pushing and pushing and pushing and Definitely feel like you're moving backwards to some level. What's the point of doing all this stuff and having all this stress when it's just, you know, making progress? Um, it sure lives. I'll get over it. It's just All I want
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, comes in waves like that's exactly right that's exactly right. So, um, I mean, that's, that's perfect. That's just, did I tell you we had another accident? My, my daughter caught in another accident. So we have three, three and three weeks. I'm a place where you can't do any help. Anyway, point being that the craziness, that's exactly how it happens. It's just their seasons, ebbs and flows, and it's wild, but your perspective of, of that, that that that comes and goes being able to recognize that being able to put that into perspective and not let it overwhelm you. I mean, you can't not feel the things you've. can be numb, but that doesn't really serve a good function because then you can't block out specific feelings, you block everything or nothing. I mean, effectively. So just being able to put that into perspective. So last week, hold on, we started talking about that. That's not even the right note, the heck. Um, goals. Did you read Emith again? Or did I ever have you read it? I feel like you said you had read it once before.
00:22:53 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
There's two books.
00:22:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Emith I have. not read not So, you still have it?
00:23:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I already, I haven't had a chance to read it yet.
00:23:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:23:08 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And you can just say that for like what I'm traveling, it's just easy to, you know.
00:23:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And do you have a target for when that can happen? Probably next week. Because I'm traveling next week. And when was the last time you read EMIS?
00:23:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's been a while. I just remember there's like an entrepreneur, the manager and the technician. And like you can be all three, but really focus on one of them. And become good at it and make sure you have the other two.
00:23:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Go find mine and remind myself.
00:24:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
is about like the person who wants to like know more. So the person who like works on your business instead of in your business, is always big.
00:24:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to go to my librarian. It's been a while since I read it, too, in that way. And it's always interesting, though, too, that people pick different things out of books. Now I'm trying to remember where I'm going to find my notes, though. where we landed on just talking about the goals, although I think where you want to go with your business and that's not solidified and we talked about purpose a little bit and then I asked you some questions. let me go back to that because that was offline so I didn't put it in my notes and I need to. And you did not reply back to me. So I asked, what did you think about those two things that I mentioned?
00:25:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Yeah, that was better than people. It's just a short answer.
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is it?
00:26:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Dogs are better than people.
00:26:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't hear you disagreeing. Okay, so I mean dogs can be your purpose. That's not a judgment. I just am looking for specificity. And I would like you to work on that and generally the reasons that will resist specificity around purpose will be internal judgment or fear of external judgment.
00:26:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, I just don't want someone else to go through what I went through and if they have to to have the easier route than what I wonder. It's really what it comes down to. So these are good people generally speaking who want to make the world a better place and they have skills and talents that I don't have. And so if I can bring something to it to connect these things and to help, then it's what I want to do.
00:27:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you realize what you're prioritizing there? That it's not dogs.
00:27:32 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It is to some level because it's the overall goal. These are the people that I would need to be able to get the outcome that I'm looking for.
00:27:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I'm missing something then. Oh, let me go like this.
00:27:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
If you're trying to build a technical project, right? You'd want someone who's like a CTO. or someone who has a technical background, generally speaking, if you're trying to build some sort of new technology. In this situation, that would be the surgical vet or Sayaka for like better term.
00:28:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, these are actually the two. So, of dogs, speaking of dogs. No, I missed my beach on so, oh, no, can't talk about that.
00:28:38 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'll cry. I'm feeling. So, again, for me, if it's a way to help, and all these people come together because they have a skill that I don't have to try to get. it's the outcome that I want. Well, still, you know, there's advantages for me, right? There's tax advantages for the potential business that there's other things going on. It's not pure altruism. But, you know, the main motive here is not necessarily to make as much money as it possibly can for me.
00:29:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so I was just trying to sort though because there are two things that in what you were sharing with me is there having dogs that longer lives and have, you know, better quality lives, but also just because of what dogs give to people. the greater purpose to you is just, and this is not when I say just I don't mean it as a judgment at all. The primary focus would be on dogs. People take care of dogs so they don't get better quality lives unless people are taking care of them. the people are just kind of the means to an end and the end is just the best life for a dog. Yes, do I? Okay, um, yeah. So, and here's another question I haven't asked you about. What other businesses do you have the side suite? besides this, besides what you're doing with Fuji?
00:30:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That's it.
00:30:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. What is your interest in July medical?
00:31:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I work with them. like them. think he's a good person, but that's really it.
00:31:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean. So. There because it makes you happy to be there. Like working with them.
00:31:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I like them. good people.
00:31:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I'm just looking at again, this is no judgment. There's just like trying to figure out. So back to the business is ran by the person. What motivates you? does your time go? Like we haven't talked about time in a long time. We haven't really just, you know, kind of. um, broken down, like you, what you're doing specifically versus just sweet law. And if your time is going to other places, if your priority is elsewhere, or, um, one of the things that I like to look at is where can one action benefit multiple things, um, so just kind of trying to take everything to account. So how much time do you feel like you spend on July medical?
00:32:38 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Can we separate out July medical versus who do you think?
00:32:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
100% and our conversations have nothing to do with those conversations.
00:32:48 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I understand. I'm just saying there's a large difference. July medical less than 1% of my time. Okay. Like, Hey, You know, there's the issue with the client or something else would be the only thing that comes up, but it's it's super rare. So it's not often Fuji I talked to I don't know four or five times a week Yeah, we just talk about everything I know he's had some business ideas for I stuff once my body like with record stuff Things in general. So, you know, I definitely spend A couple hours and we just talk to him, but I don't really think of that as business per se Yeah, that just sounds like friendship.
00:33:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay, okay Sweet lot how much time do you think you spend working on that?
00:33:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
We haven't done any time tracking or So I spent a lot of time thinking about the business A lot Things are going in problems, efficiencies, in efficiencies, in efficiencies, and efficiencies, know, partnerships do we need? What are we lacking? What are we doing well? can we push? lot of time, obviously, on the financial side of what's our cost requisition, what's our end outcome, where are these numbers looking and that type of thing. But I would say it's been the vast majority of my week, you know, we're just working on one. You know, I say vastly, I would say 65 or 70 percent of my, like, weeking, getting a stinking out of it.
00:34:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
On a scale of one to ten, you think about, because I kind of want to rank two different things. And I probably could formulate these better over time, but I'm trying to make a distinction between values. So, what I'm what I'm digging for is how much kind of joy and fulfillment and just value you feel like you get out of the business versus and separate from the level of success that you think that it has. Do you understand a little bit? It's not really and clear that I'm a little bit.
00:36:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, try to put it this way. Starting this, I never had an expectation of being in this position, so I am incredibly grateful and thankful for where I am. The other part of me constantly wants to push the envelope for better force. And so that is always my struggle because there's part of the tail wagging the dog, trying to grow, but we've got to catch up to where our growth's going to be. But at the same time, the question always comes up, okay, so what is the plan? What is next? Where are you trying to get to? I rarely ever have an answer. Sure to remind, I certainly can belong to my doing this. Okay, this business gives me the best chance to make the most amount of money. I don't know what else we'll do. That would give you the same opportunity. I see the cases as a piggy bank for lack of a better term. They're there. They're worth a lot. And so, you know, that's there. I have a lot more flexibility than when it first had when I started this room. Obviously working for someone else. So, you know, I don't want to show up. I don't have to. There's nothing that I have to do. But along with that comes more responsibility, right? So, when the fan, you're the one who's responsible for it at the very, very, very end of the day. So you put in safeguard, you've been processes, but as we grow. As systems break as didn't happen that we wouldn't necessarily expect to more just quite frankly the nature of the business Didn't Mexico lawsuit barfing it's not really anyone's fault. It was just an on the other side. It just is what it is I have to get more used to it because we've had a fairly straightforward run and Or that is some Really easy going and I'm not gonna step over dollar or such trying to pick up pennies Yeah So if You just had All the money that you wanted and didn't have to work Would you work? Yes on what I don't I still think I'll be back here trying And Do the same thing that I'm doing now you know, seeing people be able to buy their houses or get married or, you know, a house to build in their lives because of this is, you know, rewarding. But sitting on a beach, sitting in a drink, it's fun for like maybe a month, but to be bored pretty quickly. But, you know, if you're like, you have all the money in the world, would I go be like a VC or something? Maybe that would be more interesting, you know, helping solve business problems. Trying to figure out how to help people with their issues and problems in a business setting to help them grow and get them where they want to get to.
00:39:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I actually think that you would love that. I don't think that you're there yet, but I think that you would serve there really well. think that it would tick all the boxes for you. and I see that as a huge potential in your future. Personally, I was asking the question. That's what I was thinking about. So that's helpful that there is no needed off-ramp that ultimately, as long as you have autonomy over your time and the place that you work, the energy, the vibe, the structure, that you're willing to pay the price of of liabilities and management and leadership, which obviously, um because you value leadership. So that's helpful when we when we take these approaches because sometimes when you um you know when you're in in the more aggressive mode then we got to do better we got to do this we got to do that whatever the the motivators behind it the drive behind it helps to keep that in perspective. So I'm like that I'm very I'm I call it bull energy because I'm like I will plow through things and get everything done and just to help with consequences but that's not really the truth like that's the energy that comes forth is that you know I'm gonna drive through no matter what but but I always have other things keeping me in check and uh it's just usually more than most people are used to because I'm intrinsically the powerfully driven and motivated, nobody and no theme slows me down, nobody and no theme can infiltrate my goals, my perspective, my values, I guess, all of those things. So, and some days I feel them stronger than others and so, you know, whoever's around is gonna feel it and that's the conversation that comes out but that doesn't mean that just because I'm like, let's go today that I that I've failed to take into account all of the other things or that I'm gonna be, you know, mad and just want to count them all everything because we don't go as fast as I want it to and that's the thing that I've picked up about you but I'm just trying to make sure that I Understand that because I feel like I understand it way better now than in the beginning in the beginning it felt Potentially potentially not necessarily incongruent but opposing values and Now that I understand you better. I think that it's more of energy that ebbs and flows and Because of that sometimes it feels more present than others and things like that. So and and all of this affects pace and In terms of how much to push certain types of things because we can push things But sometimes at at detriment to the business. So For example, we went really really hard on these inventors and and we got a whole bunch of cases and then for a while the team was really stressed and overwhelmed but then that kind of seemed to have balanced out a little bit. You know what though, one thing I would like to look at although I know it's not very high is we're just wondering what the sub-out rate was and I wish that we could have a finger on the pulse of just overall job satisfaction like maybe even monthly that we could kind of watch as the lead volume increases and we get closer to capacity anyway I gotta figure out how to because we have the Lidify dashboard for some things but some of the things that we talk about and try to track aren't things that are in Lidify like that like the MPS scores like the the overall feedback which we've only gotten what your end financial slash time goals are. What I would want to do potentially once a month or figure out some way because at least probably, I mean anywhere from 30 to 50 percent of our calls are not damn related. So I don't know how we would segment it but and this is up to you and you get to choose what your priority is and what you feel like is most valuable to you but what I would like to do is spend a little bit more time on the overall approach for what you're doing with business. How like for Dan, he's got two main focuses and probably because money has not ever been an issue. His CPA exam, another 71 has always been since I've worked with him so profitable. that there's never been a, um, that this really not a focus of the conversation. It's more like, that's a whale, whale machine.
00:47:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
How do we just keep that going?
00:47:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But the other conversations have been really important. And that is, he wants to do cool things with cool people and he needs to be solving puzzles. So like, he may want to retire, but if he did, his puzzles would be music, making music. And so that would be his thing. And so everything that we do in terms of the other aspects of the business that we look like, we'll look at kind of run through that filter of what keeps him happy so that him. Because when he's happy as everything else works well and is more efficient, then he's better at leading and the cool things with cool people means that not cool people and not cool things have to get. out and there was a lot of that that had to be done. were lot of things that really didn't match his values and what he wanted. So anyway, but for you, dogs being so important, so special to you, and knowing that being human beings in life that more hard things will come up, being able to be intentional, organized, structured, strategic around that type of goal and just kind of lending some help to that if you're interested in it. I would like to do that because I feel like the natural consequence of that is sweet law is going to be better for it.
00:48:48 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I hear so much you're saying. You do, I'm sorry, would you say?
00:48:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do. Okay, because I think it'd be happier, but the natural consequence of that is more creativity. There's scientific studies that oxytocin boosts creativity, boosts productivity, but the creativity part is really important because to me, your success in sweet life is about innovation. It's that you do things differently. You've always done it differently from the time it took over. And so if getting to spend time purposely, intentionally, consistently, weekly towards this passion project that also has the ability to be profitable, that also has the ability to potentially get you in position where you could be a venture capitalist and maybe an angel investor or maybe a startup counselor. consultant in maybe having an incubator company. I think that, I just think that creates almost kind of like a moat. Well, so we talked about the financial moat around your business. I think this is like an energy moat around the visionary, around you. Okay. So, um, and I know we're getting short on time, but this is what, okay, so let me just thinking about time. I still want to know what the heck Mary's husband is doing, because just keeps going. It's awesome.
00:50:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, well, you've been going and we're growing it slowly but surely, and I don't mind putting more money. into it if you keep getting the same type of results, right?
00:51:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so also though, let me look at my calendar, because I would like to spend a little bit of time talking to you and why I say a little bit, it's probably at least 30 minutes to an hour about what I'm learning from Patrick and Lauren's. And then is that my smoke alarm? I really hope not. I've been battling those things, changed all of their batteries, reset them all. Yes. But I'm on a call. It's been oh my gosh, unplug them all. don't care. I'll call somebody. Yeah, it will not rip. But yeah. Yes please thank you. Okay so anyway that's something in my eye. So one of the things that I okay so so the unique thing about your business is that you don't have to be in the office and you're hardly around. That sounds wrong but anyway I don't know how much oversight there is and that that's unique to your business for me and I don't know how much of a limitation that is. It's okay so anyway that just means a customized approach to how you do the business because your value is that autonomy and being able to do what you want to with your time and and then creating the best business that you can within within within within those prime which then leads us back to the multiplier concept, which is create better leaders inside of Sweet Loss, so that you don't have to be, and so you don't have to be there, and they're just doing their jobs well, and you're basically just kind of the overseer and almost a consultant to these mini businesses inside of your business. That's kind of how I think matches in aligned with the things that you've told me about what you value. So then if I get to talk with these two business owners, one of them being new, almost like mini franchises inside because they have different offices, different teams, pods, things like that, just figuring out how you can do that, figuring out a system. that supports you not having to be there a lot and continual growth and improvement. So, what does that look like in terms of meetings with them or kind of training just what we're doing? Like, I feel like they're still not really walls in an outline of what that could look like, but it feels like it's coming into view a little bit. So, but our Monday calls, we do cover a lot. So, you said, I feel like you said third.
00:54:44 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, you can't do Thursdays, right? So, I can, yeah.
00:54:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:54:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Not this Thursday, of course, but some Thursdays.
00:54:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And next week, my Thursday is full. And then we capture that.
00:55:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I Here's a, I have to suffer and go driving courses with some one between 1230 and 230.
00:55:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mark, poor Mark, I'm so sorry.
00:55:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's very difficult.
00:55:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you, now if you, um, to take a dog with you, that would even be more terrible.
00:55:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Um, I don't think the dog wouldn't like that. So you're, you're, getting thrown around the car pretty good.
00:55:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, tiny cars. Yeah. Um, okay. How is Ronan, by the way, because somebody just never sent me pictures anymore.
00:55:33 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So really. Yeah, no, I spent most of my Sunday with him. Uh, he's really into the Olympics. He loves to watch it.
00:55:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, hilarious. That is hilarious.
00:55:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
But yeah, he's, he's a big boy. He's, he's a little dog though, which is really problematic.

How are your Tuesdays?
00:55:56 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Uh, Tuesdays are usually fun.
00:55:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, how about Tuesday? at 13th. Next Tuesday.
00:56:05 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, should be fine.
00:56:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and 10, 11.
00:56:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's definitely pretty wide open. So what will three in?
00:56:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Let's make it this time. 11. I like mornings to be productive, like, use my brain, before I start talking. Speaking of using my brain, it does not want to work right now. Okay, Mark, there we go. Sweet. My. Is that for 13th? Yeah, okay. So that will work. And then, okay, so you're going to revisit Emith and rebuild the cell.
00:57:14 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I read both the cell first and then I'll revisit Emith.
00:57:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And I will as well. And then I just have, I need to formulate just kind of a structure. Now, now that I know that we can have some other discussions kind of try to create that call format so that it's productive as it can be. yeah, the goal is just, I think, I guess what I would like is for you to kind of contemplate ponder on what it would look like to be. just if you had interest in it, maybe an investor and consultant. And what do you intuitively feel like that timeline looks like for you? And if you could create this company for, do you have a name for it or anything? You're that vision? Okay. So, just maybe putting a little bit more specificity into it. Dang it, I was what that could look like is it? I mean, because I see so many potential tangents. of creating medical programs that are training for doctors who have an interest in being specialists, trained by specialists, so that somebody doesn't have to fly to Japan to get their dog, you know, help, as well as the dog food. You know, there's so many different components to it where it could be, you're somehow involved in multiple aspects of what can affect dog health from, you know, taking care of the dog with the diet, the food, but also medical, medical care, I mean, even, I don't know, I've calmed down because then my visionary brain kicks in and thinks about all kinds of things. anyway, just ponder it a little bit more. see if you can put any more specifics on to like just let yourself dream the biggest thing and not necessarily say this is not possible this is possible or probable or likely or any of those things and just what like what would you dream about if you just let yourself dream and let's talk about that and then um so yeah there's too much of my head about this right now have to like let's end right now because i gotta make the phone call okay let's do the thing from last week so let's end out okay

Hey, how are you doing?
00:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Apparently too eager to meet me because I got here to meet.
00:00:11 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, yeah, I to double check. Double check myself.
00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
not going to meet you early then too late, but I woke up and I got immediately had missionary meetings to go to and anyway, I was just been like, oh, I'm on to my next meeting and yeah, anyway, so I gotcha.
00:00:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. When you said I woke up, I finished the sentence in my head as soon as when you said I woke up, I was like, I woke up and I chose violence.
00:00:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I, I don't know why I just feel like, well, I eat, so how do you feel about Tina? Well. The vibe she gives off is she chews this balance. I can't be like that. really wrong. I'm coming down in my old age. feel like this mission is probably really good for my attitude. Anyway, so I put notes on your last... Oh wait, okay, so just the invoice thing just to keep up with it. because I put them on, what think go automatically every month? And then when we started back, it was the first of whatever month it was like April. And so there's another one automatically going to come in a few days.
00:01:40 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Is there...
00:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that right?
00:01:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Is there anything wrong? No, there's nothing wrong. I guess I just got off in my... I probably was late on one of the earlier ones.
00:01:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and then... So there's a remind function that I can use, and I just wanted to make sure, you know, because in the beginning, like I think your finances have straightened out and whatever, but I just want to make sure everything's okay. And then if it, we need to adjust it, let's adjust it.
00:02:18 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, I mean, yeah, it's finances. The third month in my cycle of billing with titans and everything. I consistently get to that third month and it's like, oh, this is going to be, this is going to be tight. I've got, you know, I've got nine grand in my account right now. And that's for the rest of August and September. And I'll have mean, a little bit from VA and BAM. I have some money coming from Tim, which he, I'm talking with him. He wants to renegotiate, so I'm talking with him about that now to do a profit partner deal with him, so he wants to scale back to, he asked me to scale back to 3K a month, and so I talked with him, got on the Zoom last week and was like, you know, obviously like I can't, if we, if we do two things. So one, we ran that one promotion, you know, you, you, you did a little over 40k, one person signed up for your mastermind, and he, and he was, you know, that, and I think he's got some, some um, uh, some amex debt that he's dealing with, because I heard him mention he's paying like 2,500 a day on it.
00:04:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
00:04:12 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So I think he's got, yeah, a day. Wow. I think he's got some, uh, I think the money just comes in and it goes, but he's got a big event that I'll be at next month in Chicago and I've been really not installing it.
00:04:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, sorry. I'm just like, so anxious right now because I'm so upset and I'm trying to hold my mouth.
00:04:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay. Keep going. Sorry. Yeah. And so I, um, you know, I've been promoting that event, uh, for him because that's really when he wanted to focus on and because that's where he sells people into his mastermind and we've got more people attending this event than any of the past five. um, know, he converted 25% of the room last year. if he does that this year, you know, that's like a little over 700 grand to him. So he may feel different post event. But I told him that we got to reduce the scope. If we're doing 3k, I said a way around that. And this is why I proposed to him. And he said, he'd give me a half, a half yes on this because he likes, he just wants to think about it. So I said him the proposal. And I went ahead and I invoiced him for 3k because I need that money. I need some of that 5k coming in this month. But it would be 5% of gross sales that I bring in, including evergreen funnels that I build. And so in my goal would be you know, make up that extra, you know, 2K a month, but also it's like, well, he, the other thing in my mind is like, well, I probably, I probably need to go ahead and get working on another client as well that can pay me the 5K. And, you know, I do, I do like working with him and his team, you know, there's something to be said for that. He paid me, he's paid me 20 grand so far. So, I, as I did in Moison for the 3, and I got that and then, and his whole thing, he said, it's not that you, like, is nothing that you're, you're doing, like, he, he, like, likes to work and he just isn't able, I guess isn't able to afford 5k. So I feel like there's something to be said for, you know, he's not breathing them my neck. Like I have pretty much full autonomy. So there's some pros and cons there. So I'm trying to be flexible and also stand up for myself too. so if he were to say, you know, I'm not going to do the 5% of growth of what you sell, I'll probably just eke out another month or to a 3k and find some how to replace it. But also I said the near-road scope would be like I'm just going to focus on creating and running promotions. under this new deal and you know because they'll ping me like for I mean just random stuff and it doesn't take me that long but but that kind of stuff I would just you know back away from and not not do any more you're updating existing sales page copy that I'm not really involved in or anything like that or that we don't have a promotion for so so that kind of stuff would would go away and I would just focus on activities that bring me in that I can earn them and so I think it's a really good deal for him and so I think he'll say yes I I send it to him I sent it to him on Friday, yes, sent him Friday, and I know he's looked at it, he hasn't replied. I'll follow up with him before the gross summit next week just to confirm that he saw it and say let's connect after gross summit because I think that he'll be in a happier place once he has that influx of new members, and I've helped him with the order form that he's going to pass out at gross summit and a little bit with his presentation of how he's going to pitch our encircle. So, mean, I think that like today, he got an email deliverability warning from Keep because the spam complaints are getting a little high and he asked me if I could take a look look and you know that that's one of those things is like that's that's definitely out of scope but i but i know that he's using email smart which is Adriene sappages software okay and and so i did send a talk about sending email to the because i know those guys really well because they we have brian so i just an email see if they can advise or consult with him but i'm not going to work on his email deliverability um so well we're seeing that that leads but i yeah there they're kind of two things floating in my mind is like man i'm tired of getting to that third month and and just feeling the crunch and and i did have a couple of expenses that i didn't anticipate one was paying my EPA that I thought I'd already pay back in in tax season, but we did an extension that we're filing now. And I guess he built me now. So that was like 1,700 bucks that I wasn't expecting. And then there were, there were some kid expenses on the personal side, but can I dig into this a little bit real quick?
00:11:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. So first of all, let's cut my bill in half because you don't talk to me at all other than our meetings. So like, you know, extra effort, and it's old prices and we'll just, you're just grandfathered and keep what I charged hourly basically. So we'll cut that in half. That's not a huge out, but it's something and it let us keep working together. Because that's really important to me. Yeah, me too.
00:11:59 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
If you like it. I do.
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so we'll start that next invoice. If you see it and I haven't fixed it yet, because I can forget between now and two minutes that I need to do that, just pee me back and say, Hey, don't forget. And then I'll fix it. Okay. It would just be an oversight. It wouldn't be. I changed my mind. know. And then if you end up being a little bit late, because you're in a crunch or whatever, however, don't about it. It'll just need to take care of it when you take care of it. Yep.
00:12:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's one thing.
00:12:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. This guy.
00:12:35 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
What's his face? Top home?
00:12:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tim. Tim, Tim. So, um, he's, he's feeling the pain of his mismanagement and his errors and a lot of times people will displace that responsibility or just make really dumb choices because they're not in a good way. one of the things. things that you can do is the math, because the numbers tell the truth, right? So what you do is you put in a spreadsheet and you compare the price that he's paid you and the money that you know you've helped him earn. And the no brainer math that says, uh, we've our, I've already earned that. Okay. But in addition to that, that there's the unquantifiable kind of help that I've given you that hasn't been measured, such as this kind of advice, this kind of consulting and, and peer support really. Um, and, and so, you know, so it's, and, and you are not in the business of charity. And I would, I would really say these things in your way, but I think that this, this is one of those things that you write up or you do like in a video, so that you have a chance to really kind of script it out in your head. And so that you don't get interrupted and shift your energy. So he doesn't like argue and persuade or anything because sometimes people like that, especially when they're desperate, they really try to control the conversation. Yeah. And you need to make sure that his ego doesn't get in the way. So if it's if it's a long text or video, he can't argue with those things as much. He might end his brain, but he gets a little bit of space where nobody's listening to him and watching him and where he can manage his ego if he chooses to. So it gives him a better chance to be able to deal with his ego if you handle it that way. And I would imagine he might want to, because if we don't manage our egos, then, you know, we sabotage. But so you give him the math and show him, like, obviously, I've already earned my cape and I want to do more. This lights me up. I enjoy it. I understand the financial problems that you're in. I've been there. for myself. However, here's what I know. Getting rid of the golden egg, the golden goose kind of thing, or getting rid of the money producers out of a scarcity mindset is absolutely the wrong thing to do. And I'm going to put my time somewhere that is going to come back to me. You know, that's just business. But also in this economy, everybody's got to manage their resources. Well, I only have so much time and so much mental effort to apply to a project. So I'm not going to put it where I constantly feel like I have to prove myself or somebody doesn't understand the value. So I'd like you to take some time to contemplate this, look at the numbers and reevaluate. And you know, you could just read, read, restate that. That's why this offer is good, because I see your value. I know what you could earn. I know that there's a good potential for me and I'm willing to have some skin in the game by instead of requiring this 5,000 that I'm going give you my minimum. What do I call that?
00:16:10 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Retainer, base retainer, base retainer.
00:16:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Man, it's been so long since I've used the base retainer. I forgot what it's called. This base retainer, which basically ensures that I am not a victim of your poor money management. And of course, you're going to probably want to tweak that, but that's the truth of it is sometimes people manage their money bad in case in point 2,500 day on an AMEX. Something went wrong there. So it's just a matter of being bold but so respectful using the numbers and then forcing accountability. Make a decision, but just know that if your decision is to devalue me, I don't have that issue.
00:16:56 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I'll move on.
00:16:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's the The one thing about that. So cut my bill in half, my suggestion for how you handle that. I do think you should take another client because I feel like we're right now at that. know, we we felt a recession was going to come and then it was artificially inflated. that's the great vine and you listen to the conversations that are happening. There's a lot of people that are not having money, a lot of coaches, a lot of whatever in the industry. It's definitely not hurting the labor industry. It's so crazy. You still can't get laborers for anything skilled laborers, whether they're fixing cars and mechanics or HVAC or doing nail technicians and hair. Like people are still spending all that money. But in the education world and the coaching world, that's changed. anyway, so that and then I would love to dig into T, what you're doing with Ryan. Oh yeah, the one question I wanted to ask you with. Tom was, have you ever tracked your time and kind of come up with an effective hourly rate for you? And what I would like you to do is if you do that three thousand dollars, if you can create it so that you're spending less time and that you maintain a similar effective hourly rate to what you were doing at five thousand, because you modified your scope, then you should be able to be okay with that too, because three thousand is nothing to sneeze at, if you work well together, then that could grow. And if you're not, if it's not costing you more time, like if you're, you know what I mean, if you're correlating that correctly, then then there's no reason to not do it.
00:18:50 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, that kind of, I haven't done effective hourly rate, but I have, I did just look at like, all right, what is, Because I had to, you know, my days are kind of tasks, their tasks are driven. so my mornings are most productive. so I was giving, you know, a couple hours dedicated in the morning to thinking and working on Tim's stuff. And then I was becoming more, I was keeping more of an eye on the Discord chat. I even got, I put it on my phone and I was getting notifications on my phone. And then I took that off after this 3K because I was like, well, I'm not going to have those dinging me anymore to take up just more of my brain space. But I was kind of thinking that, like, yeah, I could give it 3K. And if I'm earning on what I sell, then then I kind of feel like, you know, a couple hours dedicated in the morning for really four days a week because Fridays I treat little bit differently. But for Monday through Thursday, I have started, I'll spend like no more than 90 minutes on either Saturday or Sunday, sometimes both in the morning after coffee, just, I don't really do coffee work, but I do more like planning and organizing and thinking about the week ahead. So, which I don't mind. doing that. So sometimes Tim is, Tim is definitely in that thinking. But so is Brian and everybody else fits. So I mean, that cadence has been, has been good for me. But that's kind of what I've been thinking is like I'm going to limit it to, you know, like two hours a day. For I have a Monday meeting with him and the team. That's an hour. And then I do a 30 minute call with this girl Amanda, Amanda Dake. don't know if you've ever lost pass with her, but she's another consultant. She's effectively, I guess, his fractional CMO. And she's great. I really like working with her. So that's really like, I'm trying to limit my time and the week for Tim, if the 3K ends up being what sticks, and especially if he, I don't think he's going to balk at the Refshare thing.
00:22:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But... I'm sorry, I only have one, don't know, there's two amount of days I have mutual friends. D-A-K-E. Oh, D-A-K-E?
00:22:28 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, D-A-K-E. She's got a girl in here.
00:22:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've seen her face, maybe he's just with the Titan stuff, but we're not connected.
00:22:38 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Anyway, sorry. Okay. She's really more project management, and she's handling the, like all the hotel stuff for his growth summit, all the negotiations, food, menu, that kind of stuff. But she's got a marketing brain, she's got good ideas too. you.
00:23:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how much time, because I was listening and I feel like you said like 90 minutes a day for him?
00:23:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Two hours a day.
00:23:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Two hours a day for 10. So like 10 hours a week.
00:23:19 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
And that was before? Before I was doing more than that, like I would do my creative output for a couple hours a day. And then I was a little more active in the Discord. And I get one off request for help with preexisting copy and that kind of thing. Or if I'm like I would sometimes write scripts for his, it's really his assistant. she's she's the one handling the like the direct messaging in the in the Facebook group. And this is not her not told him that like this is not her skill set. She doesn't. She's not a cell. She's an appointment setter. She's not a sales person like that's that's who he's using. Instead I was writing to help her be more successful which would help ultimately help me be more successful. I was writing scripts for her and I probably still do that on a specific promotion that I was running because I would see that as you know that like her her follow-up matters um when we're we're in a week where we're making an offer.
00:24:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Doing a quick EHR. affected hourly rate calculation. So we can just, then I'm going to, sorry, bring it only due to things at once. Let me screen share, because this is safe for you as a value calculator that we created to create some like offer calculations. We don't really use it, but can you see? Yeah. And so what do you think you worked before? Like how many hours a week? were talking about it, but I didn't hear it specific.
00:25:38 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I probably gave him three to four hours a day.
00:25:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A day? So we'll say 3.5 times five days a week, right? safe for some. Okay, three point five times five, so we'll say seventeen point five Well, I gotta bring this down five That's crazy First of all that it's not very much We really should do this for everything And I really think you need to do this because You know, you're more valuable than that. Yeah, way more valuable than that And let's do one more thing earned for The name And So we're gonna call that Yes. Um, Tom, let's do this for a Titan. Let's do this for tea. And let's set a baseline of, well, for sure, you don't make less than that.
00:27:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
But then let's start doing these calculations and make sure that that numbers start growing to a minimum of $250 an hour.
00:27:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Because, I mean, when we go do this, when we go start plugging in these numbers. And so let's, we'll do this drag up. Man, you need to use this for your profit partners modified a little bit. I'll put it in my, my stuff that I'm teaching, um, because everybody needs to do this. so you just take it. You could say, you could say you got it from Tina, that'd be nice, you know, but you don't have to. But But give this if you teach people this. Okay, because they need no so so we'll call this a month Jan 2024 and I'll just I don't think it's gonna let me drop. Yeah, okay, so If I did a few of this Let's do this oh I Think if you do if I do it a couple times hold on hold on. I I want to I want to do it myself Chris Let's do 24 and then 03 24 if you if you highlight this three and then go it'll finish it You know sometimes you have to train it with a few things because it doesn't have enough, but anyway, okay, so I um and then obviously we don't need these to be so big and no you want to there okay hold on oh tina don't don't watch me don't look at me and i really shouldn't even be doing this yet until i populated this video i want it to be but anyway we drag this out you can put this and anything new and if you go populate this and then do some math um i think that you'll figure out what your target EHR should be and um also kind of your return on investment by the hour for them let's really start digging into what you're earning people versus what you're getting compensated because you have a kind of ambiguous value in your head and their head. And we want to make that crystal clear. So your ambiguous version is you know that you're worth way more. Their ambiguous version is probably the same, but they struck themselves and let them believe that you know that they're justified in this until you do the math. And then you can take yourself off the table and be like at some point, right? Obviously you can't right now, but there's going to come a point. But I can tell you when I did this exercise for the first time, everything changed. I'm like I am making people millions. The first time I did it, I went bankrupt making people millions and that just made me mad. then, you know, still making people millions and getting Trump change for it. And I'm like, I got to change this. And when I, the value that when I really understood my value differently, I held myself differently, I conducted myself differently. And it was off putting to the types of people that would take advantage of me because they just recognized I wasn't the one they were going to be able to manipulate. Because there's lots, most people have really no idea. They have an ambiguous right. But they don't have a crystal clear like, I am 100% worth this. So then what happened is I started attracting people who are like, I want to pay Tina, I want to pay her. Like she's valuable. I want to pay her. You're one of those. And it doesn't even if they can't there's a difference between can't and won't. Yeah, you know, and so you want to be in the trenches for the people that can't but would. I want to be in the trenches with you.
00:32:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I worked for free for a while, right?
00:32:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a whole different level of engagement and even relationship and concern and mutual respect and honor. And people get to prove it by how they show up not what they say to you.
00:32:20 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:32:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, let's you take some time. However long it takes you, I mean, we're not going to talk for a month, but I would love you to fill this out for everything that you're working on. Even do it retroactively for it was Tim that you worked for before, right, for a few months, or maybe that was time. This is Tim now. This is Tim now. Oh, my bad. Okay. These people with their similar names. Okay. Anyway, um, yes. So I think you should go back retroactively to anybody that you consulted with and do. You know, it's not going to be perfect because you don't have a crystal clear memory of what you did, but fall part of the best you can. And and and compare so that when you do future client work and profit partner alignments, you have a real idea of what you've been compensated before and also what you've earned. You're just going to feel different like it's going to be eyes wide open and it may actually create some resentment if this didn't already. But the good news is that is a springboard to the place where you're really happy regardless of how this market is and how many people are suffering. Plenty of people are doing really well and it's because of the people they aligned with. I just did. It was crazy. Biggest deal I've ever done. And it was the easiest thing, really, he had to take, I don't know, two or three weeks to really think about it, but it was $100,000 deal. I've never done that before. And it is almost no work. And but it's because I made him millions. it's a law firm. It's not I am. So that's a big difference. I'm working for like my, the next client was a doctor. And it's like a no brainer for him. And in one session, I got him enough traction and taught him something that I have to do the math. What's 15 times? How much was Yeah, so he's definitely got himself paid for because there was something he he was doing and it stressed him out and he hated doing it, so he just didn't do it, so I showed him how to use AI to take the friction out of it, but also because he's nerdy, it made him excited to kind of game the system. Instead of defeating him, he gained it and I was like, I don't have to work so hard. don't to stress so hard. And he enjoyed teaching the AI model how to work for him. So each one of the reports that he wasn't doing because they were tedious as a doctor. Now, he still has to prove it, right? So it's by copy-teeping versus copy-writing scenario all over again, right? So I got him out of the copy-writing and just into copy-teeping effectively with his reporting. And his manager is so happy because he always drags his feet on this. So in one week, that's how much money he was able to get. at $180,000 that he was dragging his feet on and potentially risking losing that attorney referral source because he drags his feet on it. So I potentially stay 10 just that relationship also, which we can't be quantified right now. It can be, I don't have the data for it, but it's going to be worth millions to him. Easily, it's going to be worth, because that was one month, $180,000. He keeps getting referrals, and they all need more doctors. All the attorneys need more doctors, and they need good, reliable doctors. And he's good and reliable just slow, because he hates doing it. So now, not only does he not have to deal with the stress and the friction of doing it, but he's also not going to deal with the delayed payment, and he's also not going to risk that relationship. my value, and I pointed it out to him, my bill's paid for over and over again, copy work that you did, he gets to use that copy again and again. or versions of it, right? go ahead. So that's the thing. Changing who I worked with because of it and knowing my worth and then just doing the math in front of people and making sure that they pay attention to it. So I don't and you know this because we've been doing it repeatedly. I don't assume my people are doing my math, you know, for themselves. So I make sure they do it and go, okay, you wouldn't have had this if we weren't working together. You wouldn't have had this if we weren't working together. You wouldn't have had that. It isn't about ego stroking, but it's like, we do need to know what it does that makes a difference, like tracking macros. When do you figure out that if you eat more protein, you're not hungry anymore or you sleep better or you don't crash as much? It's not until you really look at the data, but nobody's going to make you look at the data if you don't do it yourself.
00:38:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
kind of thing.
00:38:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So do this for yourself, get really clear on it and then do it with your people and say, look, this is where we're at. So just so you know, this is what I'm going for. I'm going to take us there. If I'm not compensated appropriately, when we get there, we're going to have a different conversation. I've done that and I've terminated relationships even when I had no other money coming in, Chris. And every time they try to come back and double what they would pay me and I refuse it. No, you had your chance to appreciate it. I'm going somewhere else. So these are hard conversations, but I'll tell you what, when the economy is the way it is, you've got more leverage than you think, if you're willing to pay the price of being bold. But the leverage point is having all the other conversations and potentially taking on more work than you really want to do for a little while, knowing that the deck is shifting. And that's going to be what allows you to walk away from other things and the only new things that you take on be highly leveraged.
00:39:27 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, for sure. mean, I think I've got a moment of, I haven't heard anything back from that conservative group that said they were going to be hard to email copywriters and she's been on vacation, I think she goes back today. I was going to email and check in with them, just see what was going on and then my, I had The CPA I mentioned earlier, I met him through Brian's mastermind and he was in Nashville, took me up to dinner a couple weeks ago. He's a little awkward guy and he does all of his clients are on he just does a subscription with a monthly subscription. I think he's got two different office locations like he's got a house of wine and Las Vegas and he was in for his clients he bought the the white label version of go-high level and he just gave it to them. for free is part of their subscription to him. And I said, were you selling any kind of services or build outs to your clients and go high level? And he said, no, we're just making it available as a bonus. And he said, that something you would want to do? And at dinner that night, I said, well, yeah, that interesting. And we kind of left it at that. And I didn't really pursue it because I'm like, I don't know. This guy, he's I don't know. There's just something a little strange about him, like.
00:41:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, thanks, I said, you're good, always.
00:41:49 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. But but I was thinking I was contemplating today is like, we should have reached out to him and see because I mean, it wouldn't and offer like that, like. It wouldn't be at all. As clients, it'd have to be like a specific, you know, nitched client or something that could be replicated, you know, folks in sort of the same industry. So I haven't done anything with that. It's percolating in my head, but you know, like in September, I think I want to do another be a boot camp and in that all, you know, the last one was giving me a 10 grand and we did that one.
00:42:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can I hate interrupting, but sometimes I feel like it's probably more effective to do that because I have an intuitive thoughts with the experience and the experience that you have had. I know that your intuition is very good, very, very good. Within the parameters, sometimes the intuition is just a don't do anything and sometimes we can use that just to make a very narrow scope of support contract that serves us and it's temporary. So you don't look at it as any kind of long-term potential but also there are always going to be things that you need to run through the good better best filter. You have X amount of time and high level brain energy to use each month. So to the point of if you say yes to anything this scope needs to be clearly defined, narrow and highly lucrative and highly leveraged and you can make the pitch of here's the offer take it or leave it basically. Now your energy is take it or leave it. The words are not, obviously, but you want to be very clear energetically in your heart that like, you're not attached to it. You don't care if they say yes or no. You don't think about, but I need this money because if you do that, it comes out in your energy. You need to trust that the money will come and you already have your, you've been improving the leverage and efficacy of your efforts in tight. Regardless of the fact that you should be getting more, it's still improving, not very quickly, but it is improving and your attitude and energy about it is making that leverage increase. We have been refining this process more and more and though it is small and not enough, 100%, it's a measurable increase in leverage, which is really important because It's also an increase in the compounding effect, meaning you're spending less time spinning your wheels and reactively responding to what's there in the Titan's world, do you agree with that? Yeah, for sure. so we have to trust that continuing to massage and leverage and refine what is happening there is to your best interest and that that simply takes a matter of time has to, but that we know that it has a return that it continues to improve for you because we've got other resources, other people, I mean, like where we are this year is night and day from where we were last year trying like at this time last year was when we were getting operational help and conversations. got Brian and Carla on to meetings, and you got a couple of different people helping as a result of that work, that, you know what I mean, you were so stressed out about all the emails that were happening and having to do the development work just night and day difference in a year, not night and day difference in the last six months, right? But in the year, which is why I like that as a look back, very significant and it only happened because of you. That would not have happened without you driving. You drove it, you obtained those results. So we got to take that into account. So now, I don't know how much time you have, but I don't have a hard stop.
00:46:49 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Do you have a hard stop? Yeah, I got to go pick up Madeline at 2.30.
00:46:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:46:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So I can catch up on the fee.
00:46:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. But also, you If you want to have another conversation and I won't change the fact that I'll cut the invoice in hot to really kind of refine what's happening on Titans and help you just get a little bit more clear on what you're doing. I've promised you before and I mean it now, oh, give you more time. I know that you're very capable about doing some things by yourself, but I do also think that the experience that we've had is that I really can help you figure out a way to better leverage your time and I think that it's time sensitive that we have a deeper conversation about what's on the table for you right now so that the next time that three month comes around, it's not so stressful for you. Especially because that's coming around winter, holiday, time, know, I would really like you to be better prepared for that. So, if you want to have another conversation, not next week because it's the first week of school for my girls, but the week after. I would like to have an extra call.
00:48:04 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Would you be okay with that? Yeah, yeah, that would be great.
00:48:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. All right. So yeah, let's dive into tea and then we will come back in a couple of weeks and please do feel free to use voice messages or whatever as you're contemplating things. But really, let's set the intention that the next three months, you're not stressed out like this. Let's let's meet that happen. Okay.
00:48:28 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay, Mullen. Yeah, so the, I mean, the tea is steadily moving forward. just been, it's just so slow. Like, and I know that if I was doing this, like, it'd be done and up and running and I think the, well, I'm Today, I'm supposed to get an update from their developer who is connecting ClickBank to ConvertKit. I gave him everything he needed on Friday or Monday of this week, but easy connection. mean, easy for me to say, but I feel like it's easy connection to make. So that buyer is using ConvertKit for the tea company, and so he's like, I'll have an update for you on Wednesday. so sort of my way to see if I can update today. And if I don't, then my message tomorrow is like, let's get on a call. Let's figure out like, why does that It's taken so long. And to figure out what the roadblocks are, hopefully there are no roadblocks I don't know about, that would be not great. And because the product has already been approved, in ClickBank, the sales pages are up. They're just not, it's not live on ClickBank yet. I've got all the initial email. Like everything's sitting there ready to go. And John, I think it's yesterday, John texted me, he's the elder, he's the dad. And I was just apologetic, but it was taken so long. And. So I just, I just don't know why it's taking so long.
00:51:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And this is not still the server issue?
00:51:15 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
This is not still the server issue. This is like just the crossing teas, dotting eyes, getting all the back and stuff to connect and that's probably not there. I don't know. Let's say it's not their forte. They've got this developer bin who they hand all this tech stuff off to. And so maybe it's just, and I don't know, been under a minimum. And so maybe he's just the hold up and they're not pushing him or he's not the kind of person I would hire or I don't know what it is. But yeah, it's just feeling like this. it's just taking way too long to get this offer up. But it's funny when I think about, then I spent this morning, because I wasn't feeling great this morning, and I had a headache, so I was sitting there thinking and I started making a list of what are my client options and then my brain then goes to, I start thinking about the tea, like, the thing I like about that is it's product-based, it's something that we can build, at the heart, it's really a nutrition company in the health space, which gets me excited about that. And where that can grow, we all have the, we're all thinking, eventually this is something we want to build so that we can sell it. So, but I brought that up because I was like, part of my mind today was like, well, I just started like going down these rabbit trails and Google keyword, was like, what are people searching? And then, like, the quilting niche and what are people searching for and, you know, dog training. I was just like, because I started thinking like, maybe, because I hadn't really, anyway, I was like, maybe I should be open and just kind of spend some time thinking about this and I was like, well, that's kind of what attracts me to the tea. So, I don't really have like an end point in that, it's just where my mind's been today, like I've been looking at that. these different niches and thinking that, well, I did kind of lean on one, you know, the fastest path I need some cash is probably doing some kind of client work, but anyway, I've been kind of, I've been kind of all over the place this morning. Yes, I've been off my game, well, I guess, whatever.
00:54:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, here's what I think. I think there's two things. First of all, I think we have probably about two years, because I think that we finally hit the, what happened in 2006 to 2009. I think that we're, I think we're right around the 2007 kind of numbers. it really tanked in 2008.
00:55:02 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I don't think we've hit bottom.
00:55:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't think we're at 2008 now, but it started in 2006. People really have focused on 2008, but it started happening in 2006. If I recall correctly, going through all of that, it was shifting then. Anyway, so always be thinking leveraged, and the most leveraged thing that I think that you can do is be a high-paid consultant. Now, why that's leveraged is how much time you spend doing it. You have enough connections, but here's the other thing is, you're in a situation where almost everybody is not highly leveraged, and that's the issue. don't have the kind of money to make you a highly paid consultant. So the way that you could be leveraged is having somebody that you can actually use, who is not as smart as you, might be very good and should be very skilled, but not as smart as you and aware as you in terms of being leveraged. So a lot of the contractors are not making, probably not going to be making the money that they were, because the people they were working for are losing money kind of a fist because they don't manage their business as well, and they don't manage their money well. There is going to be a shortage of client work for those middle level people who are really good at what they do, but who don't have a marketing engine to get them new clients and who are losing clients because their clients can't be. So what I think that, and this is going to be like we've talked about rolling up your sleeves, and you've been there for a while, but It feels different when you have somebody else to riff with and to work with. I think what you should be figuring out is, and to me, I think Chris, one of your most powerful and valuable skills is offer creation. The hook and the offer is high level strategy, but then most people don't have the fulfillment team to write that copy, write the email, write the sales pages, write the follow-up sequences, and that actually is not as valuable, but it is necessary to offer creation. Most people don't have the brain for the offer creation that can write copy pretty well. Okay, and they don't have the co-honies to say, hey, this is what you should be doing, and here's why, and they won't do to do the math, but they can write the persuasive copy. So what I think that you should do, and this will take a little bit of time because you gotta find the right person, but I think that you should focus on a consulting gig that makes you a minimum of $100 to $150 per hour, effective hourly rate based off your number, and that might change after you go plug everything in. And then what you do is you price it accordingly, and then you go hire a copywriter to help create your vision that you copy chief, again, trying to focus on that effective hourly rate, being an increase of what you've already been doing. So that way mentally you're like, yes, I'm working more, but I have raised my value and I can see it. So that level of satisfaction, and basically what you're doing is removing that friction and that resistance that's been stressing you out of I could be doing better. because now you know you are doing better. Does that make sense? Yeah. So I know you got to go, but what I want you to do, and let's revisit this. Again, we don't have to wait until we meet. can have these conversations, okay? Look for some consulting jobs where they need help with offer creation and leveraging their business so that they're not bleeding money and they're getting the most out of what they already have, right? Repurposing things, improving their offers, their leverage. Nobody's talking about leverage, really, you know that. But that's the saving grace for us in these hard times, is leverage. So create leverage, and then you go leverage somebody else's writing skills and ability, or even chat GPT and train it well, but focus on leverage because that's the thing that's going to keep you, especially in this third month. people from stressing out. We need to talk more. You've got a lot on your plate. Use me. This is my genius zone and I want to use it for you. I don't want the third month to be stressful for you. There's no need for it. You've got too much value and too much that you bring to the table to ever feel that again, no matter what the economy is. Okay.
01:00:26 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
All right.
01:00:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I fixed the invoice. don't know if you saw a screen share. I didn't realize I was in paper. I adjusted it. I sent a schedule for it to me in two weeks. Please talk to me more. Let's make sure we get you through and then ready so that the stress month doesn't ever come again. There's no reason for it, Chris. You're very good at what you do. You make money. There is still money out there. We just need to get you correctly aligned and leverage. bridging other people.
01:01:03 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, that makes sense. I'm bored with that.
01:01:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's all there. You've done we've talked about the community and your network for a long time. You are primed for this. We're just going to need there's going to be one other talent person that we need to figure out. So ponder on that. And we'll we'll find it. But but you're in a good spot. Still, we just need to use it better.
01:01:30 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's all. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I mean, it's a it's a better third month than the last third month.
01:01:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But definitely the next one's going to be better. That's what we're going do. We're going to make the lows higher and the highs higher. That's the improvement. Awesome. Okay, it's always good to talk to you. Let's keep talking.

You're so quiet, but yeah, definitely. Are you there?
00:00:11 - mark sweet
Yeah.
00:00:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you?
00:00:14 - mark sweet
We're good.
00:00:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You sure? Why are you so quiet?
00:00:21 - mark sweet
I'm always quiet. Most annoying thing. the way up.
00:00:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're not always the same kind of quiet, though. You have nuance to your dynamics.
00:00:38 - mark sweet
Yeah. Interesting New York Times article. Well. Uber is trying to put on the ballot in Nevada. It's easy to have that happening. To cap attorneys fees at 20%.
00:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What?
00:00:58 - mark sweet
Because they're getting sued left, right in the center for. having their drivers aggressive or people. so their solution, instead of, you know, doing better, is let's make it harder for people to bring lawsuits. Because originally they were forcing everyone to arbitration, but then there was so much backlash they stopped that. Yeah.
00:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are the odds, do you think, of that passing?
00:01:26 - mark sweet
Um, not small. It's a short answer. Because they have people telling others that during, I think, 80% of the fee, and so this will stop them from taking more. And yeah, I don't think it's very hard to put together a campaign ad saying, stop pretty attorneys from taking all your money.
00:01:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so two things, and only one of them really matters, I guess, for you. Well, okay, so these are the two questions that pop in my mind. One, how can a law firm stay in business with that and two, then how do people get any help from attorneys if there are no law firms who can afford to do business with them?
00:02:19 - mark sweet
Well, first, this would only be for work. What it means is there's by going to be excess costs. like, okay, this fee is just for the attorney's time, not for the paralegals or whatever, and they charge separately to try to make us a difference. Yeah. It's just going to get, I don't want to say shadier, but more complicated.
00:02:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:02:48 - mark sweet
So, I mean, there's always a workaround. The question is going to be what is it? Uh, institutional arguments, I think as well. know, how can you actually cap this? But federal law does have a cap on the attorney's fees, so it's not like it doesn't happen.
00:03:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and there's precedent, but what is the federal cap?
00:03:09 - mark sweet
I think it's 25%.
00:03:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then how do you get 40% attorney fees? If there's a federal cap.
00:03:19 - mark sweet
That's only on federal cases.
00:03:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay.
00:03:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, only on federal cases.
00:03:29 - mark sweet
So the only other states that have a cap. Really or equal one has it at like 50% one has it at a third. But yeah, we can go up from that. So we'll see what happens.
00:03:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, how let's see. We don't even have any Nevada cases this month yet. Okay. Off the top of my head can't think about how many cases we get in Nevada.
00:03:58 - mark sweet
We don't really have any Nevada cases.
00:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, that's new. It was one of the newer ones. Okay.
00:04:05 - mark sweet
Um, Will it immediately have a direct impact on our business? The answer is no. Just, you know, future proof. The Nevada firms will then continue to look to expand other states like Arizona and Washington and potentially California. So there's kind of the back and forth. So that's just what it means. Um, so move the Midwest is still better for us to try to build out.
00:04:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, yeah, and probably in a lot of different industries because the Midwest just, I mean, the Midwest is like the Old West. It's just, it's like, or the Wild West, it's still, I don't know, it's like it's America 100 years ago, almost in some ways.
00:04:57 - mark sweet
Yeah. So, I mean, this is at least two years off. Okay.
00:05:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:05:03 - mark sweet
And then I, I guess.
00:05:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dan, the, the thing was that Nevada is trying to pass some law that caps attorney fees at 20%.
00:05:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Time to start Arizona firm. Let's go.
00:05:20 - mark sweet
Well, why are everybody just came up because the Arizona was serious about it, but there's an even more out of state firms coming in, which they're already pretty pissed off about.
00:05:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean. Well, and that's why, I mean, whatever the industry is, it doesn't matter what it is. The, the way to, it's not, I don't believe in future proofing, but, but trying to, but is, is to have the leanest business and the most optimized business possible. Whatever those systems are, whatever those. processes are, and I mean, the attorneys need to be thinking about that for themselves. You need to be thinking about that. Nobody knows what the timeline is, but whatever the most optimal process is, if you're not thinking about that constantly, which you are, but that's the thing. There will be some other companies that will be doing that and other ones will die, but the pace of change, first of all, is fast, second of all, it's getting faster. So continuing to look at what we can optimize, what we can systematize, how we can better use our resources is just going to be the thing. And then how we can duplicate across locations like we're already working on. So what is the, I have to go back. I know I have notes, but Utah, what's the situation with Utah update?
00:07:00 - mark sweet
Brad left the law firm that he was with and joined some new law firm so we're still signing cases I just got to make sure we have the new routine of the new law firm but in the cases he had with the previous law firm it still is so what Dan we haven't talked about litify reports what's his name is like on vacation for a while what are the latest updates on reports do you know yeah now he did this calls thing for me based off of what I brought up like two weeks ago about like I'm trying to figure out like I don't know what I'm trying to figure out trying to figure out if there's some sort of really
00:08:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
relationship between call volume, can we look at call volume over time? that opposite time? Does it say the same? And then how does call volume, if any way relate to retainers matters, right? So he busted out this report, I think he sent it over on Thursday on Friday. So Stacey, well Stacey has been, so must have been Friday. So she's like, Hey, you got to look at that, get back to Josh, but I've not looked at him. And I don't, I don't know what I'm looking for. It's more like the date is there. Is there are there gaps? I don't know. And or that it could be nothing, right? Just because the way that intake works. I think there'll be some relationship between call volume probably, but I don't know. But all the other reports that you wanted, all those are done. So all are they right?
00:08:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know. Yeah, that was the thing about that.
00:09:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
and last time and um no he picks those so it's like now we have to review the updates okay so what's your new report called uh i don't even know if it's a report it's um some call thing it's probably not it might be a dashboard but i don't know how he did it or it didn't lit up by so it's probably it's either a reporter a but i don't i'm medical ubering right now i'm going to pick up my patient it's another lovely money of me driving average call to convert source to state type there we go that's it um so what's funny is he did i was like i want to know this and then he was like oh you want to you should look at it like this i was like yeah sure you do that we'll see if that i wouldn't even know
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like, okay. Automobile.
00:10:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think there might be nothing. That's the whole thing. I don't know that there's going to be a damn thing.
00:10:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I will let you look at that then. Can you look at that before I call next week?
00:10:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:10:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:10:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm stuck on this 20% thing now.
00:10:20 - mark sweet
So, it's like, yeah.
00:10:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
no one will adapt, right? Is what I think. Most will not adapt. So, they will, they will die. So, they're not even going to, they may not even know it's happening. But I'm sitting here thinking, okay, if you run the math on 20%, like you're out of business right now, pretty much.
00:10:51 - mark sweet
Right. Like, that would be lower or gross by about 60%.
00:10:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, like, do you plan to try to game out an inevitable future? Or do you try to like, what would it look like to exist in that world? And I legitimately keep thinking about an Arizona firm. isn't that the real future? And yeah, those, because I met with they were floored that I know you guys are going to find this hard to believe. So a lot of these law firms don't know their numbers. Like, you're kidding.
00:11:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Really?
00:11:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So like, they don't have an average retainer value. So he's like, where did you guys get that from? I'm like, a calculator? Uh, not that hard. Hey, but, and they were, they were cool about it. So they just have cli plans over and over and over again that don't get the value of what they're bringing because they don't have any internal math whatsoever. So they're in the same sort of hamster be alive was on. When I had that business, it was like, you'd go back to them six months, theirs is short of period of time, ours was literally six months. And six months down the road, they'd be like, oh, didn't work. And I'd be like, uh, so you didn't sign or I would have the leads. I would start reading the leads to the, I go, so we say to this guy in a motorcycle, oh, yeah, signed that guy, yep, but it didn't work. No, I signed him. Okay. So it did work. Yeah. guess so. Oh, boy. And they're all just lawyers that I'm a lawyer. Yeah. I know. I'm well aware of what you are. So they, you know, they've got some pretty big firms like doing a lot of leads. And they get good conversion rates, but my argument to them is like they might not be making money because as we pointed out several weeks ago, they're signing everything. So they don't know what's what at the end of the day. And then if they don't track it through the end, they don't. So at the end of the call, the guy goes, all right, so if I ask you a question, go, yeah, if you were us and you had a legal agenda business, what would you do? And I said, I wouldn't have a legal agenda business. And he's like, what do you mean? And I said, I would go, I would start in Arizona from I would get involved with someone that could start in Arizona. And they knew what that was, but they were like, how, how do you do that? I said, well, I'll tell you how you don't do it. You don't go get a bunch of private equity and think you just put money in one end and money comes up the other. Because that's, you need to know all these things that we just talked about. And as you. No, that's hard to come by, right? There aren't firms like that. But to me, the model's real. It's just no one's done it, right? No one's actually, they don't know the math of, hey, this is the acceptable cost per retainer and this is the whatever. It's, you know, it's my my whole idea of money execution thing, right? those guys, the idea is right. They, you can't execute it, but and you, you do need money. But if you have money in the idea, which is all these people you guys have, it failed miserably because they didn't know how to execute. Now, whether and they probably didn't know how to execute from an intake perspective and they probably didn't know how to execute from knowing the math of what works, what's not, they thought they could just throw a bunch of money at it, get retainers, and ooh, money. Anybody thinks that at first? but it's like, Part of me is like maybe that maybe that is the play is to work or maybe you And I'm thinking of this right now. like maybe you go start an Arizona firm. That's not sweet love And you go hey, gonna go build I'm gonna go build this other thing on the side that doesn't that's the optimized right genius word the optimized version of this so There are no loic. There's a lawyer Right, there's no there's a parent. There's a parent. There's a pot and you go can I can I get you know How many Arizona leads are there right now? It's like if I could get Four or five Arizona retainers a month you can gain that out you can map that out into the future And see what that looks like and what does that? I mean, I guess you could just do that right now You don't need to do the thing because you know you have all the math and say hey this is what that would look like this is what the profit margin on that would be and then how do you throw that so it's almost like you build this parallel track if it makes sense mathematically and then that's probably a pretty future proof model in a world where every state goes to 20 percent or whatever like you don't even care so i'm like that and then just use that spurtly can you have more than one law firm for an attorney that's what i thought there was some kind of limitation technically no technically right well litigiously
00:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, would it be even a conversation risk wise to have?
00:17:12 - mark sweet
So it's not as simple as just open up a firm in Arizona.
00:17:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Yeah.
00:17:27 - mark sweet
There's more that goes on.
00:17:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But you know, I'm like, let's just gain that out. What does that even look like? What is the profitable is that for. Right. Or that, that idea. nothing great. needs to be a firm.
00:17:42 - mark sweet
Why would it be more or less profitable than what we're currently doing.
00:17:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Because you have close to no overhead.
00:17:54 - mark sweet
What?
00:17:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You knew it's better being in the case. I know, but it's just a spreadsheet, like what does that spreadsheet look like and if you can like build a model around the thing, what and it's real, so I'm just curious like what does that actually look like it's it's just like when it came up here in the that we're wrong, it's eventually going to come fight us in the because the model of literally selling a single or, you know, two products, whatever, like we average two products per person, you know, per car or whatever. And we were selling 20 a day and I was like, okay, the problem with that model was, well, if one day, 10 people show up. But I just made half the revenue and that happened. I would have it all the time. So then when I modeled it out as a subscription, I was like, OK, if I get the same amount of customers a day, the business triples is what I figured out. And I was able to create that spreadsheet because I had all the other data, I just had to map it to a different model. And when I did that, and literally I struggled for years, I just couldn't see how to do it. I was like, I don't know how we do it. I thought I was trying to build it in parallel, and I couldn't because I couldn't get enough data, and it just, it wasn't real. And then I stumbled upon how to do it when we were these jerks were trying to require us, and I had to do a bunch of math, and then all of a sudden I was like, oh wait, there it is. And then when I mapped it out, I saw, OK, I could do this for 90 days, we're in the exact same cash position we were trying to do. higher, except tomorrow, I'm going to make 10,000 guaranteed. And the day after that, I'm going to make 10,000 guaranteed because now I'm on a subscription. So that's what led me down that path. And then consequently, I didn't really see how much it would increase the overall gross business, but it did, like I said, it tripled. So here, it's like, Oh, wait, we have all the math. So let's build the spreadsheet. What does it, what does it actually look like? And then you can say, Oh, maybe that's maybe that's something that should be pursued. And then you then you get into the, well, you'd have to do this, you'd have to do that. But the it's real, the spreadsheet would be real. The math is real. It's what it's what the PE guys were missing. They probably didn't even have the other, but we have both pieces. It's just we have all the data. It's just not in a model. And it's like, whether or not you do it is a different story. But to know what it looks like, I think it could be would be interesting.
00:21:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, I just had a thought that I've never had before because of what you just said, which is, and I don't know if this is possible or probable, but probably worth at least the conversation, rather than, or at least, okay, anyway, all these different thoughts at the same time. But what is the possibility and or even just ability to create a separate entity, and a separate business model that is not sweet law, but that you own mark that is almost like a science experiment of the most optimized level so that you could, without disrupting and having to move all of this to modify and alter this giant organization compared to something very small with maybe just one attorney so that it's not you, not because you actually need an attorney, but one attorney that out to scale with multiple assistance and case managers across multiple states where we figure out the thing that we've been talking about which is basically an attorney less type model with much less expensive people working for you, one attorney so that it's not you, one that you're and it could be one that's already existing and I haven't thought all of this through but basically what if we build the model that we're talking about, aside from sweet law, very very small and see if it can be optimized and then scaled like we are talking about and take it out of theory and into practice and see what what could be done.
00:23:08 - mark sweet
So walk me through this a little bit more. Obviously, I'm certainly whatever else. They're now going to be court owners of a law firm.
00:23:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So that's- No, no, no, no. Not that one. No. No, I was just, they just were like, what would you do? I was like, I would do this. This is more about taking the the vendor model to give this vendor model and you're plugging it into, let's call it a traditional pre-lit firm. And now you're like, well, what if I plug that into a different model? Same concept. I'm going to go take vendors, but I'm going to run them into this Arizona firm that's using a model that is, like Tina said, this attorney list or this optimized firm. This idealized thing that, what is that? I look like, right? So it's like, how do you do it? And part of it is there are on staff. There is no Sam Tyler, blah, blah, blah, blah, right? So there's a pod maybe, or there's an optimized pod. And then you go, OK, this thing is getting this thing is signing five cases a month. And then you game it out, all right? Well, then in nine months based on the average on the average retainer amount, blah, blah, falling in $40,000 a month or whatever in month nine. And then it's kind of recurring, right? If all the numbers stay the same. So then it's like 40, 40, 40, But what is the actual profit margin on that? And I mean, we can literally do this in a spreadsheet.
00:24:51 - mark sweet
It could. So we're just making a parallel firm has its own intake, its own accounting, its own legal team.
00:25:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, we're not actually doing that. We're mapping it out so that you could so that we can look at that and go Hey this things Got 40% profit mark like whatever. I don't know what it's gonna say exactly, but And maybe and maybe like maybe you don't do it. Maybe you go Maybe you invest in it or we get you know what mean? It's like it's not necessarily I don't know what the outcome of it is but to know the model It's definitely what the PE guys were missing and it's like maybe that's the right like okay So if it's a law firm that can have non-lawyer partners you have that But what if one of the partners was a lawyer but wasn't a lawyer at the firm right? Can you be mark sweet that owns a piece of another law firm and not be a lawyer in that law firm? don't know Baby to it, but you're still gonna have all the liability and everything else.
00:25:57 - mark sweet
I'm sure right But why is this any different than say taking a case building out a pod that is in Corona or whatever else they're giving 50 plus fees back two-thirds of you back whatever it is.
00:26:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well because you could get other people's money right so you don't have to fund it so then you can go get I'll just say Omar you go to Omar and go hey I got this thing do you want to invest in it and then and you're not coming out of pocket at all and then it becomes like this sort of a revenue thing I mean it could be bigger than that right once it's mapped out then you're like you're building this asset you could start a new brand yada yada yada but really it should be way more profitable but it's almost like I was on this call this morning and it's we're going through this idea of buying catalogs of the music catalogs of these independent artists that are dormant and And part of the math, like the example, when we were using the catalog makes $8,000 a month right now. Well, that's with no promotion. So I can buy the, we could buy the catalog and then it's $4,000 a month to basically pay the financing. And then, and then, so I was like, all right, so you get four grand a month. And then the other four grand, I'm like, well, what if we just pump that into promotion to grow the asset of the catalog. So it doesn't make any money. And it just becomes this recurring thing of we're going to just invest in the asset over time. Because in year five, the assets going to start paying out more. And then we don't have to promote it anymore. So you could do something like that where you're building this machine that's like a self perpetuating machine. Like, I don't know exactly what it would look like, but I would like to know, I mean, dude, I can. do the spreadsheet. have all the data.
00:28:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I might just make it. And you do that by next week?
00:28:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Probably. I would like to see, I would like see what it looks like. Because then it could just, it could be an investment vehicle. It could be this like annuity that you build around using the knowledge and basically the knowledge that you've acquired.
00:28:23 - mark sweet
But how is it any different than me just doing our intakes? I know what's coming through, you're placing a certain firms in the field is bad.
00:28:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you expand on that? Because you said that before in the 50 like. So first of all, I don't think it has to be a separate entity. But the biggest thing is that your model of what you're paying your attorneys is what's choking you the most. And that you probably don't have to like you could, I don't know if you could use assistance for or paralegals for most of the work, but that's part of the conversation that's been had. So if it was somebody else, they would not be, it would be almost like they don't even have any connection to the rest of the sweet law. They don't operate the same. They don't have the same kind of commission structure. So it doesn't necessarily have to be a separate entity. basically, some very different type of operation is what needs to happen because it's the model that you have right now that is not optimized. Nice. Hello.
00:29:42 - mark sweet
Yeah.
00:29:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You did.
00:29:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was my I'm always like, you're sick. there was a female voice that it was definitely not damn hard.
00:30:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. No. Soft and twist.
00:30:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So I love it. I love it.
00:30:08 - mark sweet
love it. Getting outside money. Well, I don't want see is like not a problem, but that's generally not the main issue. Plus, again, new partners, expectations, dynamics become a lot harder, right? Yes. Getting loans or lines of credit are easier, although obviously more stressful.
00:30:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I don't even think that's necessary. we're going to go minimum viable option, the simplest thing is create the model instead of, okay, so we've been talking about working towards building a more simplified model because we already have this big entity that exists the way it is. And there are multiple iterations and modifications in order to get that and vision. What I'm saying is, let's just create a new entity. It's not necessarily separate physical from sweetball. thought as a company. But it is in terms of the way that it operates, like it's an entity within an entity, with a completely different, you know, what do you call it? My brain at the moment is not working.
00:31:20 - mark sweet
No, we're saying just having intake the intake and referring out for the highest fees back possible from these other lawsuits, so you don't deal with the headache of actually running cases. And you just cherry pick the absolute best of the best, the best slam dunk.
00:31:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I'm not saying don't do that, but I'm saying that wasn't what I was talking about. I was talking about almost the same thing that you're doing now. But first of all, an attorney that is not getting the same payment structure, because that is part of what's hurting you. And then in a sorry, like I'm in an extreme amount of pain right now, my brain is not working really well, so I need both of you to help pull it back to conversations that we've had before. But to the point of like Salko has talked about what you could do, I don't think it's not having cases and I but more of who's working the cases and working them up and how it's getting done because I think the bigger issue is your compensation plan that you're paying attorneys that mostly don't have to do anything like understanding that also part of their function is being a liability buffer because paralegals in case assistance don't have any liability. Therefore, they're not incentivized to be extra cautious to make sure that they're not doing anything that's going to get you sued whereas an attorney is because they have liability. So anyway, but I'm looking at what is the most optimal or a two, maybe two variations of the most optimal type of model that we could build, that we're not able to build in sweet-law because we've got existing expectations and compensation models. Anyway, do you guys get what I'm saying?
00:33:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I do, but now I'm thinking, wait a second, we can actually, like, Lorenz is the only person that works in Arizona, right?
00:33:29 - mark sweet
Hey.
00:33:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh my god, there's some other.
00:33:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, so.
00:33:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
so now I'm thinking, thanks the new guy. You can, you could have, we can build two models, right? You basically have an Arizona firm right now for lack of a better price, right? You take all the money and that's going into Arizona now, that's operating as a current pre-lit firm, and then you con trust that against what if what if those things didn't exist and you would strip away Hank and Lorenz and yeah then you look at the marketing expense that's going there so yeah we can actually do this right now I'm super curious to see what that looks like because it should be a way higher profit margin entity or idea whatever you want to call so you're technically correct as it looks right now because like all of intake was under California payroll in California right yeah but we peel them out and say we know intake 600 bucks a retainer we already did that map so you just yeah but we did your map and it came out to a yours was slightly higher it was like six six forty or six twenty or something and then you we have the leak cost we have the average retainer we have all the things it's just and then we can put in It's like a left verse of this versus that. So it's like traditional pre-lit versus this other idea. And right, like you said, it's not that it needs money. That's just part of the formula, idea, money, execution, right? Sometimes it doesn't need any money at all. And it's more about like, you're talking about, it's really an exercise in what happens if this was executed differently. With the idea of like, hey, there's a future where fees could go down to 20%, right? And you could factor that and go, okay, now let's switch, let's switch, we know right now, if you switch the formula, you'd lose 16%, whatever you just said. You could then switch that formula in the thing ago. This is what it would look like. went to, it all went to 20%.
00:35:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One more thing to think about that, in light of that. And again, I'm gonna tell you right now. mentally diminished capacity. But is there an opportunity? So going down to 20% fees in Nevada, if that happened, and obviously it would take some time, and by the time that we get there, it may be a moot point if we already have a more optimized model where we don't want to think about this. But you may be in the position of investing and being able to do this by the time that rolls around. Let's say small firms just die off, but they are maybe operating in some of the smaller communities, and they've got word of mouth, and they've got, you know, all these lead sources coming in, but they just can't operate like that anymore. Somebody's going to try to buy them out. Could you do that preemptively? Could you, and rather than actually buy them out, can you, I don't know, like just buy their leads, be like, look, this is coming. When we get there, anyway, this is this is a very premature conversation to have.
00:36:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But because it's happening with Salka right now. I literally just thought that the same thing. the thing that I was talking about earlier with the catalog, when I talked to those guys, so right now there's a catalog for sale. It's 250 grand. I did the math. It's worth way more than that. It came up with this formula based on the streaming, just the streaming revenue. They want 250 grand, so I was like, we should go back to them with an owner finance deal, and they were like, what's that? So this 50 grand down, 6%, you get paid off in three years, we have the ability to balloon payment whenever we want with no penalty. So yes, you could then, part of this could be looking at these older guy firms, and you go in and you own or finance the acquisition of their firms, but really what you're buying is their referrals, right? That's kind of what Steve is doing. It's Salka's weirdly, sort of inheriting these firms. I don't quite understand how it's happening, but you could do something like that. And again, then you're just getting retainers into this optimized entity. you have no money going up for those retainers other than the acquisition, which is a fixed monthly cost of whatever it is. And then you can go value that firm with your data and go, because they're not going to have it. What's your average retainer value? I don't know exactly. But here's the average retainer value in Arizona because I've already had hundreds of cases here. So this is the value of your firm.
00:38:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know why I always laugh at that. Because it's a sad truth, yeah. Every time. Hi. What are you thinking, Mark?
00:38:58 - mark sweet
It makes sense. It's complicated, but makes sense. months.
00:39:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's definitely different.
00:39:05 - mark sweet
You're just going to be with the cost pre-acquisition, you know, at the end of period, no matter what, whether it's a 20 percent fee, a 30 percent fee, a 5 percent fee, right? Yeah. It has to make some sense. The smaller firms may actually end up better off because a lot of their stuff is just bored of mouth referrals. So they don't have a marketing cost.
00:39:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No.
00:39:27 - mark sweet
So they may actually be the one that better off and say, you know, Ronnie, Sweet James, whatever else the board does, because they're marketing machines.
00:39:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Their margins are susceptible.
00:39:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. sure.
00:39:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, I think that's the next so are yours, right? like you are that to a degree.
00:39:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think the best way to have this conversation is with a map, with we can plug something. thing in of this is what we know, right? And this is, and then do some projections if the margins were this, if the costs were that, you know, this is what the output would be. And then talk about logistics of what would it cost to operate this? What is that, you know, the range high low in terms of expenses, margins, things like that. So that we, what's that? I'm talking to my Anyway, just to visualize and kind of wrap our heads around it, but also to figuratively and literally actually be on the same page, having the same kind of vision as to what it could be. Because I think that that is back to minimum buyable product options, whatever. And knowing that the longevity of being in this business requires. being optimized, and also knowing that if you were to modify your compensation plan, you're going to upset people, but they may not have anywhere else better to go, so there's that. But regardless, it will affect morale, it will affect productivity, so that's not really a super viable option. Then what is viable though is building a parallel business that was born optimized based off of your pre-existing information knowledge experience, all of that, and then build that out, and then you can either maintain them both parallel because we've optimized enough that it doesn't take a lot of your personal bandwidth mark, or eventually the existing model of sweet-law kind of fizzles out, dies out while the optimized model grows, gets legs and becomes what you wanted the original thing to be. I think that so much much of their, there is the, you know, I built this house, I have to live in this house. Not a, this house can be a rental property, I'm buying another house kind of thing, which is where I go.
00:42:14 - mark sweet
Can we talk about something completely separate and different? you. You know, we're in a small break, but any dance help with this?
00:42:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:42:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Go.
00:42:26 - mark sweet
So yeah, Chona took a job with Dr. E, so she's going to be doing kind of regular hospital stuff and clinic work, but she's also going be doing personal injury stuff.
00:42:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay.
00:42:39 - mark sweet
So this is where it gets interested. I can't send her into my cases because there's a conflict. So when she goes with other doctors and lawyers, lawyers, lawyers are really bad on the tech front. The only industry I think that may be worse is medical. By far, so government or government. Now, this may be a really cool chance to try that money dot com CRM that I know Dan's been talking about a lot because they do have a HIPAA compliant CRM. The only issue with everything is going to be HIPAA compliance. There's no zapier that's HIPAA compliant, but there's a like knockoff that is. So what I need to figure out how we can build is like a Monday dot com. can do scheduling with VAs that can take the basics of a patient, know, age, height, all that stuff. Sets up a telemed appointment. Telemed is probably going to be zoomed hip up. 15 minute console notes get pulled together mostly from a tent with the information the VA has gathered. They put all the other doctor reviews it before sending it over to the attorney with the appropriate bill. If we can actually make this work, it would be something very easy to sell to multiple practices that do personal injury because there's not lot out there that is very good. Okay, but I feel like there's some you might put something about that.
00:44:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
A bunch of high level is HIPAA. Okay, there's a bunch of people that do use it for HIPAA related businesses. So scheduling, I'll be done there, right? So they integrate with Google Workspace, which I think I'm not sure if that's HIPAA, you could definitely do the scheduling. Yes, you could use Zoom.
00:44:54 - mark sweet
We'd have to find out if Zoom is HIPAA, probably is. There is a Zoom HIPAA that is charged more for it.
00:44:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. And then what else, what else do you have to, so you schedule the appointment.
00:45:07 - mark sweet
So they also need to do some sort of reports and bills and traffic of all this.
00:45:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You can definitely do invoicing from within it. That's no problem. Then, you know, if there's. It would depend on what the reports are, right? So I just recently started creating my own apps that you like you basically I frame inside of high level. So as an example, for the thing that I'm working on with the music studio guys, we built this Spotify app that. It creates this sort of magic link that if a user clicks on the link, it launches Spotify and it's like, hey, follow me on Spotify. But then it also. kicks in their Spotify account, the album you choose, the singles you choose, the playlist that you choose, no, no other app does that. But it looks like it's just part of, it's called fan flowy. It just looks like it's built into fan flowy, but fan flowy is really just a white label of high level, like leave. So, yeah, if I understand, if we map out all the requirements, then I can go down a list and go check, check, check, check, check, and then you can determine if there's a custom app that needs to be made or not. And, yeah, it definitely sounds possible.
00:46:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, there's, so needs is relative, needs because the function doesn't exist or needs because, because there's another opportunity where you are right now mark in building that. So there's something called SkyFlow, which uses OpenAI and different LMSs, LLMs, learning language models. Anyway, to make that data HIPAA compliant, and then there's one called Bastion GPT that is HIPAA compliant GPT service. But if there is, like so Dan's got Norio, if you have somebody who understands the code, if you understand what would make an API call to OpenAI HIPAA compliant, there's got to be some things, right, that it basically maybe has to reside on certain servers, has to have certain security protocols. And also, in terms of the communication being bidirectionals, so, omnid, what's the one direction? Anyway, so that data doesn't get fed back into. So open AI, so you can pull information from open AI, but it doesn't process outside of the secure server, so it stays compliant. Anyway, if you built that, then you would own the software service, that would be another revenue stream that you could have. we're on the precipice now, where even if somebody has it, nobody owns the market. That market is, it's a blue ocean right now. But in terms of having the assets to create something really well for that, just our understanding of it, Dan has a great coder that could do it.
00:48:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There's a lot of people. Who is the end user? not a doctor.
00:48:42 - mark sweet
Like what is the end user's mix, right? So like a certain type of doc, like that part, I'm not sure. Yeah, let's go through stuff by step, because it's the problem. So, lawyer is usually sending over a patient.
00:48:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
do a lawyer or another doctor?
00:49:00 - mark sweet
Yeah. we're patient to, which is you've Dr. E for lack of better term.
00:49:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:49:04 - mark sweet
Before that patient sees Dr. E, someone's got to call and get some basic information. Right. Uh, name, height, weight, date of birth, all that kind of stuff.
00:49:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:49:17 - mark sweet
From there, if there's a personal injury component of it, the doctor's office is going to confirm, generally speaking, with the law firm that one, there's a sign lead, meaning the doctor's going to get paid, uh, to probably making sure the case is good. If you were a higher level doctor, not a chiropractor and scheduling that patient for a certain time. From there, you need to get the lean sign by both the patient and the doctor. Then you schedule the time to come in. Generally, if it's pain management, the first appointment, you can do a telehealth. You don't have to actually physically see them, or you can see them physically. doesn't really matter. If want scheduling, you want reminders, if it's to a location, you know, hey, here's where the address is, right, they can just click it and put it into their map really simply. Before the patient actually sees the doctor, it would be better that someone or a system, either a VA or a system, has those basics, this is what the person's complained about, this is their demographics, then they see the doctor, doctor takes all their complaints, reviews the records, and makes a recommendation, physical therapy, MRI, injections, whatever it may be, that's a report, that report and those bills would then be sent to the lawyer's office. All right, then you obviously have to keep some track of your AR, right, because that's what you're doing, so it would be cool to be able to see all the, let's see, cases you have with, so you're large, whoever it is, that gets paid, you're good on it. side. That way you can track how much you're getting paid by each lawyer's way, frankly. How much are they dropping? How much is making sense? Does this work?
00:51:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So that's, and so you're, yeah, and you're, what do they use nothing now? Or it's just some non-system paper and this and that or whatever.
00:51:21 - mark sweet
You use the electric, I definitely dealt with some paper. There's electrical medical record, but you know, the amount of personal injury they do right now is like less than 5% of their total business. The vast majority of what they do is health insurance. Yeah. know, you know, health insurance and what we do are not aligned in any way, shape or form.
00:51:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, right.
00:51:46 - mark sweet
So that's why I almost don't care what they currently have because I can almost guarantee whatever we're gonna put together is going to be a thousand times better.
00:51:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And they would use it just for these. They would be like, oh, this is just for our PI work.
00:52:02 - mark sweet
But of course, as in everything, once we're gets out that, Hey, this is good. Everyone's gonna want it. Because it needs to work with the back end stuff. the biggest pain in the .
00:52:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. And then we're talking how many different it's pain management and chiropractors or it's just pain management. Is it multiple types of doctors?
00:52:25 - mark sweet
So for what we're talking or just a handful, he's just a pain management doctor that you some procedures as well.
00:52:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But he's just a pain management.
00:52:33 - mark sweet
But if this works, could it go down streaming to chiropractors? Yes, chiropractors are usually kind of the last month of the cheapest people. Like they don't have a lot of money, pain docs, neurology surgeons will want this because they don't like dealing with the back end and right now they're just hiring people or hiring VAs to handle it, which comes with those issues.
00:52:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then it would be like Dr. E or whatever, it is working with sweet law and and and or it's like not not 20 firms but probably more than one or one to five or whatever I would guess where do we have far more real yeah wow okay just think of the you I can't sit on my volume to one doctor because it looks funky it looks bad sure sure where the client lives that may not actually be an option yeah three from the doctor you're not going to asking with one more firm and Chona is now inside one of these places she will be starting September 1st okay I mean that's where it's super helpful is to from me specifically to like get someone that's like in the thing and then show me the saying but I mean I'm listening to you right now and I'm literally building it going oh okay yeah all right yeah I can think I don't think it would do it like this complicated but you're gonna be no it's literally just knowing what needs to be known, right? you rattled off these things. I was like, okay. And in my head, I'm like, okay, I know that's built in. We were just the thing about high level is like, it's, it's like a sort of, there's, it's sort of like an erector set. And you, you, there's all these things you got to use them, but you have to understand what you're building, right? You have to sort of have the blueprint and then go, oh, yeah, yeah, all these, all these pieces are in the box. I just got to do it like this. And then eventually it could be a, that piece doesn't exist. Now I'm going to go build it outside and bring it in. So far, nothing, I mean, and obviously we're not too deep in it, but so far, I'm like, yeah, this is all in the box. I don't see.
00:54:47 - mark sweet
All stuff that's off the shelf.
00:54:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
really. Yeah. And then you've just build, you build these custom automations and custom, whatever, you just, you just, we just have to put together the blueprint and then go, okay, now let's build that. And then the like SMS you don't we don't build that that's there But you write the SMS this and you write the automations and you set the schedules on that so right? Okay, yeah, I mean it definitely sounds plausible And then Yeah, you'd go after pain meds first so because then you'd have that you have the idea of you would build They called it snap, but basically it's like you build this whole File we'll call it that it's the pain management file. So you go. Okay. got a new pain management firm loop launch the file boom the whole thing's built and then they just they just fill in their name their address stuff like that and then you you Assasify it and you're charging whatever right you I mean We have pretty good idea of the value of it. So it's probably a high dollar sass.
00:56:01 - mark sweet
And you could also theoretically buy their paper.
00:56:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:56:07 - mark sweet
So you've got two different avenues where you can make a lot of money off of them.
00:56:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but I'm building it in somebody else's house, and you don't own the software. So that's you know, no, yeah, did. So do you.
00:56:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, no, that that's the beautify level. There apparently there have been people that have exited their high level businesses for very large sums of money.
00:56:35 - mark sweet
mean, look at point.
00:56:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's ridiculous. It's built in sales force. Yeah.
00:56:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's they're using the same model like there's they make money selling white labels. And then it's up to the white labeler. I think the problem with high level. I actually just went over this with someone the other day. The people that are making money with it right now are selling the drill. of you could build an agency. In my view, the people that are going to make money with it for real, are the people that build things like this, the litifies of high level, where they turn it into a service for a certain target market, and then they go occupy that market, and then that recurring revenue multiple is real. doesn't matter. Yeah, if you built a couple of custom things, that's going to make it look better. But really, if you want to sell that business, they're just buying the cash flow. And the cash flow is real. the cash flow is built on your brand that was built on top of this software, but you went in and customized it for pay management doctors. Nobody else did that. And then you went and scooped up 10% of that market at $9.97 a month, and it's like, okay, yeah, we'll pay you. And then your stick rate is three years or whatever it is, that's what people buy it on. that's eight acts in your own.
00:57:58 - mark sweet
And look, we know doctors, they're Not innovative whatever they have they rest it with no They are not innovative at all so It seems to line up very well kind of what we've talked about and again I don't know what we're gonna learn from doing it for a doctor or some good things.
00:58:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're gonna learn for our own stuff But right yeah, I can see Dan taking an hour to build this first me taking two weeks It's not that fast, but here's here's the other benefit of doing that I think that you're all see if we if we were to build that The way that you could optimize sweet lot even more because I think that you would have a perspective shift That would be It's just one of those experiential things like when we first really saw the data like you thought you had a concept of what the data Looked like and what your numbers were and then we extracted and actually had that and that was like wow I didn't realize things were that whatever. I think it would be the same type of experience where your perspective would shift so much about what you think is possible versus what you know is possible because you saw something like that in action.
00:59:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well that's like I was just thinking how you know we're looking at this 20% fee thing or whatever but and it's like oh thinking three years out well if you think about the call two weeks ago we arrived at this place that was three years out from hey man you need more vendors or this could go sideways and now three years out you set a record and that vendor went sideways and it didn't matter yeah I was like that's that is great I was like I love that I was like that is so awesome so now it's like hey is it crazy to look three years out is it crazy to consider this 20% thing no no crazy not to no yeah it is you do the exercise it's like okay and maybe maybe it means nothing and maybe you learn something and but I'm Other people aren't going to do it at all, and then that's their folly.
01:00:05 - mark sweet
Yeah, no, I agree with you. Look, in the worst, the worst case, we just built something else to make money. It's not a terrible situation.
01:00:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, and there's not a maybe you'll learn something.
01:00:15 - mark sweet
You're guaranteed to learn something.
01:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. haven't done a single exercise. You haven't gone. Wow. Yeah.
01:00:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, you always learn something even from the failures.
01:00:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. And you're just paying money for that knowledge.
01:00:28 - mark sweet
But this is the right doctor to do it because he's he's a good doctor. I don't think he's the best doctor in the world. He's a good doctor, but he's a very, very, very smart business. So someone will get it and then, you know, it's on the people.
01:00:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So yeah, that's super important.
01:00:44 - mark sweet
Yeah, yeah, because most doctors are going to say no, or I like my paper files.
01:00:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
01:00:55 - mark sweet
Yes, but OK, cool. But I want to bring that up before I forgot about it because it's going to take a little bit. it's together, but like Tina said, I think it's going to actually take dividends over what we do and could help us with some of our own, you know, climb follow up and whatever else we're going learn from.
01:01:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, speaking of that, I mean, I've built some crazy, the stuff we're doing for the bands and the, like, I've built some crazy stuff on high level now. And it's like, Oh, okay, I get it. So I'm like, Oh, yeah, I can see how to build.
01:01:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, my last note is speaking of doctors and technology. I just showed Fuji how he could like save a huge pin in his butt with chat TBT and he's super excited about something that he hated. So it's good. Evolution and technology is our friends.
01:01:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Is he a chiropractor?
01:01:44 - mark sweet
No, he's pain doctor. So, Oh, he is. Well, right.
01:01:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He's the, he's the other guinea pig.
01:01:53 - mark sweet
By the way, you know, he does not know about each one of those new jobs. So not that you would ever let anything prop.
01:01:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Nope. Yep. Okay.
01:02:04 - mark sweet
Yeah. So again, if we can make this work, I'm very sure who would you be someone who would be extremely interested in using it?
01:02:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, totally.
01:02:14 - mark sweet
It just makes sense. Um, although I know they're more sales force based.
01:02:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:02:20 - mark sweet
Yeah. level of crossing would be to the extent of what just happened is, hey, there's something good, but that was very generic and I didn't talk about what it was. So if that's okay, if that's not, I'll just never say Mark or Fuji to either one of you. No, you can say more. been trying to build out systems that help doctors be less stupid. Um, and this is what we've done. And I think you would very much understand that.
01:02:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yeah. I'm very, um, very shallow in any references to other people always.
01:02:53 - mark sweet
But yeah, wait for Dan to make more money and need to have less of it.
01:02:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm all for it. Everybody. Yeah. And also to have fun though, that's what's important, we get excited like our brains light up with this type of stuff, that's something to pay attention to, it's not just about making more money, it is about how we're doing it, it's the fun, it's the down loves puzzles, I love puzzles and cool people, so all of that, I think we're all in alignment with that type of thing, but we can't ever lose sight of that.
01:03:22 - mark sweet
So originally with Twilio, which is HIPAA compliant, and Zoom, which is HIPAA compliant.
01:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and it won't be far behind that other things get there very quickly, that's the other thing to pay attention to, is how fast the pace is, and that the pace is continually increasing exponentially, so what's not possible now is, and that we think is maybe five years or ten years away is like a year or two away at this point.
01:03:58 - mark sweet
Oh, and also the whole physical therapy people. They're asking me questions of how can I do their stuff that are considered in a lot of VA's and running their heads into the program.
01:04:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What you could do is write up what those things are. I did take some notes with Bathum that I could try to get dance for you to kind of plug in, Dan. But whatever you're looking for, the specifics mark, having that in a document, email, whatever.
01:04:25 - mark sweet
You would say what Bathum pulls and then I'll just add to it.
01:04:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sure. I will do that as soon as we get off the call.
01:04:31 - mark sweet
Cool.
01:04:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Everybody have a good day.
01:04:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Have a good week. Word. Get me the Google ID mark. Do it. rip it off his head. I will do my math. Okay.

see. Let me get this into it.
00:01:25 - Chona Sweet
Oh, that's too big. A spreadsheet and then the giant text. I did it through the notes app. It's bold.
00:01:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see. homework. It might be colder than I realized it was out here, but I really just needed to be out of the house for a while. Let's see. that's Fuji. There we go. Oh yeah, so you're already using dragon dictation, right?
00:02:09 - Chona Sweet
No, so what happened was he bought a dragon device, but it's not compatible with my apple and he bought apparently he bought me a laptop, but I don't he's all over the place. The one that has I don't have it, so I'm still using my Mac, so which and if I told you this I have arthritis and I can feel it now.
00:02:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I'm a witch.
00:02:43 - Chona Sweet
You did not tell me that, but I have osteoarthritis and yeah, I have I have psoriatic arthritis, so mine is a different kind of different, but it's you know it's it's more of like a you know skin, I have two in one psoriasis and I That's fun. Yeah, that's lots of fun.
00:03:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, did Mark decide if he's coming or not?
00:03:06 - Chona Sweet
I don't think so. He's slammed. He's like so short when he responded. he wanna, I'll let you leave.
00:03:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You tell me what you want. So let's go back over the homework quick.
00:03:20 - Chona Sweet
So map out, ideal, work read. Okay. So I can also copy his comments into my notes, which I was actually, yeah, when you're done. No, I was thinking about it and I don't know why it's having difficulty answering that question. I don't know why. I feel like because your question is now and the future. Yeah, I don't know why it, I'm having difficulty answering that. question. That's, that's something to look into.
00:04:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tell me just work through it.
00:04:13 - Chona Sweet
Talk, talk to me about it. So I think right now, I mean, maybe because of the, um, uncertainty of all of these, like, I honestly do not know how I, I assume that I will have to work a lot. That's what's in my head. That's why it's hard for me to even schedule something for, to work on my physical health and maybe, you know, schedule a workout.
00:04:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel that's actually the reason for the exercise. So we reverse engineer it is what we do. Now there are going to be seasons where you're definitely Going to be putting in a lot more time. You're in one of those seasons right now starting as always the hardest part right, but there is There's not really any such thing as work-life balance right where everything's always everything is good all the time That doesn't work but it's more like Changing harmony like if you ever seeing and you're seeing in music the notes are changing constantly and Sometimes they're in harmony with each other. Sometimes there's dissonance and all of it's beautiful and and it's orchestrated on purpose, so What what we want to do is figure out So this is a conversation about principles and priorities and values right and from that so Principles and priorities inform What we're going to do and why we're going to do it and well okay so principles inform priority right what's important to us our values inform what's important to us what's important to us is priority right and priority informs activity what are we going to do it should it doesn't always most times people are on autopilot or they're doing they're reactive and they're doing what they're told to do or what they think they ought to do rather than what is actually most important to them so by having this conversation early on we get to the point sooner rather than later where you can do the things that you need to do because whatever you do if you're burning yourself out it's not maintainable right hey Mark sorry I just caught the last part about trying to burn yourself out on purpose now yeah tell me something I don't know mr. sweet let's go faster let's go Oh, master. Oh, my gosh. Tona, do you know how many times if I could have, like, reached through the... Yeah, who many times?

00:07:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

00:09:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So, because we can never time things perfectly, because you know, like, there was a patient that came to see Chona that was involved in a car collision. And it's not like a big enough case that I would get super excited about. mean, I would probably take it all things considered. So this was a really good way to for her to introduce herself to some other law firms, right, one of which ways to introduce yourself to a law firm. Hey, I have a potential case for you. And depending on how she had the relationship start, depends on how you would approach that, right? Yeah. And so the initial reaction was she had a law firm try to send them a case at one point and pull the case from Chris and Frank. And so I was like, okay, we'll meet that. the good one, but they weren't very responsive. So, I connected Chona to Mike Hobbes, who's a firm that I personally work with a lot. I like the guys a lot. very, very straightforward, but they're a very high volume firm. So their model is they get a lot of referrals from other attorneys and they also do a lot of their own marketing. This is not as we confuse with the Hobbes up north that Dan's worked with before, just FYI in case that comes up at all. They do about 300 cases a month. So, they do a pretty significant amount in just California. Okay. So, they're a high volume firms, but they're good guys, right? wouldn't connect to Chona if you didn't think we're good people. So, I don't know how the conversation went, I just said, hey, I'm introducing you, I called Mike, I told them about Chona about the practice that's going on, and one of the things that Mike said is, look, we're getting pushed back really, really heavily about doctors in our cases. So the doctors making a huge value difference on the personal injury side, which is something that I've you've heard me preach about, you know, 10,000 times. That's why the doctors are so important. So I go and spend time with them. That's why we keep trying to find new doctors because the personal injury course gets to be known as, you know, people who just do the same things again and again and become very well known and the insurance companies devalue them very heavily.

Are you watching the football game?
00:11:27 - Chona Sweet
That's, I don't know how you can see the background on the school.
00:11:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What, that was sorry.
00:11:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's muted.
00:11:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's squirrel squirrel. Okay.
00:11:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Anyway, I thought it's wrong. And so that's one of things that I love with what Chona works with with Dr. E because he does so much insurance work. He barely does any personal injury in comparison. And so he's a very like clean doctor. And so even if gets to pose or whatever else, he can honestly say the vast majority of my work is insurance. This is what I built all this is when I do this is why it works. And it's great. And so for a firm like Mike Hobbuses, they're really excited because, hey, this is a new clean doctor that's like a secret weapon to someone. So now we've got three factors coming together. And I do this to kind of lay the groundwork, right? yeah, she was reaching out to them with, Hey, I've got this new client for you. So awesome. This doctor's already sending me clients. I told Mike, you know, I don't really want you on a sending me clients and not really want to send them clients because I think it could theoretically be a conflict, even though it's not. But just to not be conflicting.
00:12:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Avoid the appearance.
00:12:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Avoid the appearance of it. Reality and appearance are obviously two different things. But you know, these are people I trust and they're like, okay, that makes sense of why he's marketing me something really great if he doesn't have any interest, right? And it makes sense of why I'm doing it because I can't do it really for myself. Right. So here's Chona's introduction this afternoon to Mike Hobbuses, who could drive them, you know, 15 to a. hundred patients a month.
00:13:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, huge.
00:13:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
They're not ready for 50 to 100 patients a month, unfortunately, of new PI with how they're set up. But I can always pick and choose the timing of these things, right?
00:13:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, you can not do it preemptively, like too soon. You can do that.
00:13:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
an option for past that option.
00:13:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I just wanted to make sure that we are fully accountable across the board.
00:13:28 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
The other part of it, too, is I know Dr. E's, I mean, he's patient, but there's some lack of patients as well. Like, you know, been 45 days now and he probably would want to see some movement on the personal injury side.
00:13:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're faster, Mark.
00:13:42 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What does that sound like? Yeah, I know. Constantly faster. But also, this gives Chona a reason to say, hey, we need these things in place rather than just home.
00:13:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, sorry. dias are starting to hurt. Okay, focus, focus, focus.
00:14:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Her, I also saw this as a way for Chona to leverage this fact of, hey, I've got this new attorney's office who produces a lot of cases that's going to start sending us stuff that we need to get our together for lack of a better term, because Dr. E said the right things during our lunch of, hey, we'll make sure we have the proper email and proper things, but I kind of know how these guys go and like they'll say the right thing, but they get so distracted by shiny objects and, you know, else that's going on, and just quite frankly, his work period, that it's not top priority until it needs to be a higher priority. And so this is a way to push it to be a higher priority. Okay. That being said, in the short-term interim, so you were trying to push Dr.
00:14:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
E into making your work that you're doing a higher priority. I just want to make sure I'm on understanding this clearly.
00:14:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay, cool. And sorry, Chona's value and everything else. So that way, Dr. E gets a little more excited about building up the structure he needs to build out. Realize it's actually right there. Correct. And it's happening and not just theoretical and not . Yeah, got you. Um, so that's the reason for it. And I know that if something does go wrong on the first one or two, like these are guys I know well enough I can give them give Chona another chance in a couple months, but I obviously would prefer not to do that. So so when you talk about first impressions, you're more about like the whole operation, not like I'm talking about, unfortunately, you know, Chona's been told, okay, we've got this like info ad, you know, pain management or whatever it's called. We've got cast. We've got everything else like you telling Chona like, just do it yourself until you have a system that works because when you rely on other people, it's not their priority. It's a higher chance of it going wrong. And so it's building a temporary system until she can build a better system and a better thing around it.
00:15:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm with you, except you need to understand where she's at. She is in the oldest profession. That's not the oldest profession. Okay.
00:16:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:16:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:16:05 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That is definitely not the oldest profession. Why not? she's in that.
00:16:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a whole other thing we're going to talk about. Okay. One of the oldest professions ever. That is predominantly male. And this is, this is the reality though. There is an energy and a stigma and a literal psychological term. Ask Jonah that shows up and I'm trying to explain this in the way that you could understand because I know you and I know you're like whatever just do it. That kind of thing. But it's not that it's actually it's really not that easy. Of course it needs to be how I do things. Okay, but so there's there's two things that you have to deal with. Number one is the the actual issue of the structure and the mentality that she has to massage and work around. But the first step is China has to feel confident enough to do that. And that is being built up right now. That is new. So you remember how I talked about saying sweet things, Mark, and being encouraging. This is going to be one of those things where you actually have the most power to do that and just encourage her, again, a particular way. Because I can tell you as a woman who's come up, you know, six years in corporate and then in this business, there even when you're a very, very strong woman and born that way, there's, there's a lot that you have to fight mentally because you're kind of groomed to feel energy and then pull back when, when you resistance and kind of be like, okay, well, work around it, whatever. So the best way, and I'm telling both of you, the strategy to go around this is similar to the tactic that you just pulled, which is let me show you what's really on the table. So, and Chona, one of my favorite things that I learned is that it's better to make forgiveness than ask permission and just kind of do things. But, Mark, the stress and the energy that, so let's say she goes and she does everything perfectly. It's still going to stress the crap out of her. And she's going to take that energy and anxiety and it's going to need to have an outlet. You understand this? You've gone through so many things since we've been working together.
00:18:31 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know. She's in control of it and it's not up to someone else to drop the ball. For sure.
00:18:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Chona, who's being quiet right now and can participate in this conversation, you can do all of these things. But you guys will all get there faster. Just understanding the real, like, so you're not answering your phone first thing in the morning and checking the email and being reactive to everything that happened. She's barking at the dare. They play tag. Literally, they will just chase you. each other and the deer will stay there. And if the dogs go away, it'll stay there until it comes back and then they just wait down. Anyway, have a daddy. What was I saying? Sorry, it's only last during the talk. Dogs, but I really need to be out of time.
00:19:21 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, if I were in children's shoes, I would use this opportunity to leverage it. To talk to talk to me, to say, hey, I've got this potentially coming in. Let's try to make a system for right now of some of these new patients coming through because the one in our trip, it's like, yeah, I'm going to make these changes. going to set up this email that's proper. going to talk to Cheryl. I don't know if I'm to or did that not happen or you don't know.
00:19:49 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, so I'm not sure you want me to answer your question for you. want to talk about what we talk about. We have us or, you know, I don't know where you guys will just start right now.
00:19:59 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
we need to know what structure has been
00:20:00 - Chona Sweet
I haven't seen him the whole day. I just saw my patients because he texted me like 20 minutes before 9. He says, oh, you're taking over Long Beach patients today. And so I just get ready and it's 30 minutes away. So that's what happened this morning. But to answer your question, I haven't talked to him. He's gonna call me supposedly tonight. He's in the OR right now doing cases. So that's that. So I don't, I don't know if we have an email. Sorry.
00:20:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry.
00:20:40 - Chona Sweet
Go ahead. You're still talking. Right now, I spoke with one patient that's coming from Mark. Actually, I talked to her last month. So she's kind of all over the place. So finally, she agreed to come tomorrow. So that particular patient is coming from me because. through Mark. So they created a group chat for me, the office manager cast, which is part of, the office manager Cheryl cast, which is part of the lean and then me. So they open a new chat for me and then another person for me to put in there all the patients that's coming from me. Just a, not a formal medical records. It's more like, Hey, I have this new patient. Can you put it on the list tomorrow for me? That's, that's the, that's the only progress so far that I've seen that some sort of kind of segregation, like for me to say, this is for Chona from Chona, you think the chat for her. So that's actually a good thing because I, that's a start because I, I checked them today and I said, Hey, I want this patient to make a release. then the managers, like, we created a chat for you. I said, I'm not included. So and then he's like, okay, let me include you. So that's actually a win already. That's number one and then number two about Mike have us about this new patient that I I'm referring to them right, so I talked to Mike have us and I we talked briefly about the patient about my background Where we're at where offices at and he asked something that I really don't understand he asked something about who manages your lean or your the paper you guys have someone else just doing that so what I understood is he's third-party Person like choice and what I said is no, it's just us managing That's my answer and then he's like, okay, so that's that was a question.
00:22:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Let me explain to you exactly what he was asking They know exactly what he's asking. He's asking about billing Yeah, it's a lot of pain doctors and a lot of busier practices have either third parties or a biller handle it. And it's generally a huge source of frustration because those billers are paid on what percentage of the total bill they get. So they're incentivized to try to get as much from the lowers as possible. And on our side, lower side, it can get really frustrating because it just sometimes doesn't make sense. we'll make a very fair offer. And they try to squeeze out an extra hundred bucks or 200 bucks that just pisses off the attorney and takes acceptance. So yeah, so what you about was you being the main point of contact for billing for scheduling for everything else kind of in the short term. So you have control and how this feels good about it. And God forbid you ever leave Dr. E or go somewhere else. It's tied to you and not to someone else.
00:23:48 - Chona Sweet
So here's where my appreciation of all of this right now with with because I view and I told Mark about this and Mark gets, you know, easily appreciated with me. because I asked a lot of questions and I'm new. I have to reiterate that I'm really new at this field. And I don't know the dem, you know, all the abrogations, like anything like that. And sometimes I think Mark gets frustrated because, you know, Mark wants the things done, but he doesn't want to discuss the steps towards it or even diminution, like little things. I, like when I was asked that question, talking about first impression, I don't know if he got impressed with me or not because I, and he asked me questions about where do you do your MRI. It's a good thing I remember where I've been there for one and a half weeks, one and a half months. I remember this imaging place. I said, the wave imaging, I said, and then he said, that's actually a good place. it's a good thing that I even remember that. But then again, between Mark and Dr. E, I don't feel like I'm getting enough information, like. actually not support me, but it doesn't feel that way, if that, if I'm being honest.
00:25:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a lot to say, let's break all of these things down. First of all, just taking into account that there's a lot for you to wrap your head around. And Mark, so have I ever used the driving analogy and explain that to you what it's like, either one of you? Okay, so do you remember what it was like to learn how to drive? Yes. Learn how to drive.
00:25:29 - Chona Sweet
Actually, I was telling Mark I learned how to drive here in America.
00:25:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so here's, here's the point of that is that when you learn how to drive, first of all, my girls always think that it's so easy. They're like driving it so easy. I can't wait until I can do it. And then they get behind the wheel and they freak out because it's terrifying because what you have to process mentally, you have to know the law. But the law seems like it just goes out of your brain because now you're faced with, I'm at a forward intersection and I don't know if I go left or right. to drive stick. So I'm also trying to process the clutch and the gas and the break all at the same time while my mom's over here freaking out and I'm feeling her energy. And then I'm like, do I go? Do they go? And there's all of these thoughts and it is overwhelming and frustrating. And every single second in the car is stressful. But then a year later, you know, you've just been doing it. And one day you look around and you're like, this isn't that bad. It's not that stressful. And five years from now, you can eat and drink and have phone calls.
00:26:32 - Chona Sweet
You shouldn't do that. I'm just kidding. Nobody does that.
00:26:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, don't worry. I don't put on makeup or do any of that stuff, but I will eat and have a conversation. Oh my gosh. Anyway, there's the neighbor dogs. So the thing is, in the beginning, and for quite a while, you're mechanically processing everything. But there are gaps in knowledge. So when you're first learning how to drive, if you've never come into They have roundabouts now. They didn't that used to have roundabouts. some of the roundabouts have multiple lanes. And some of them don't. Every day, China is running into something brand new. Every day. And we don't know what we don't know. So sometimes she doesn't even know what questions to ask. But then if she has enough perception to say, I need to ask this question, but there's nobody to answer the question. Or nobody who can answer it from the perspective that she needs it, right? And that's different brains. It's a combination of different brains, and different personalities, as well as different values, which hold on to that word of values, because we need to come back to that with Dr. E. But you have to keep all of that in mind. Chona, this is why I'm telling you, like this is where you just have to buckle down and know it's going to suck for a while for all of these reasons. And you are going to deal with people who don't understand what it feels like for you to do what you do. And that is part of the path and part of the journey is not doing it because of how other people show up because of but because of what you want to come out of it. So if people aren't giving you what you want, then you have to decide, am I going to keep pushing until I get what I want? Am I going to drive this? Or are you going to let Mark drive it? And then you are just passenger and you're just kind of the leaf blowing in the wind. So I would recommend that you take a little bit more charge of it. If doing these things that way but for you to feel confident in it, you're going to have to drive and but taking into account that right now you don't know how to drive. You don't have the tools and you don't have the practice so it's important to keep that perspective and it's going to continue to be frustrating. Now there are things that we can do to speed up that process and smooth it out and one of the things is having a conversation with Dr. E between the two of you, I'd be Happy to join the conversation and help facilitate it, but it's really important to know what are his drivers, what are his motivators, what is his top priority. Because if his top priority is I'm on autopilot, I get through the day, I want more money, but I don't want to really put any effort into it. I don't want to do the structure. I don't want to make any changes. That's not really compatible. So then you got to hold them down and mark this to somewhere where you could be really useful be like, you say one thing, you do another. So like, these are the numbers that are available to you. Now, don't use my language. Use yours. This is me saying this is around the conversation, right? You have to figure it out. Now, did you just sell him into something he wasn't really interested in because you could?
00:29:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, no, no, no. Okay. Dr. E is a good doctor. He's a better business person. Okay. And he's been doing some personal injury before all of this. Personally, he's not brand new to him.
00:30:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if he's a good business person, why is he not understanding how to support this process better?
00:30:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He is drinking out of like four firehouses at the same time.
00:30:13 - Chona Sweet
Like Mark worse than me.
00:30:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's not necessarily a good business person.
00:30:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That's a busy business person. Very busy business person. Like we're talking about how he took over for Optum. Now he has 6,000 plus regular patients he needs to see and not enough staff to build on top of it. He's in the OOR right now. He is a practicing doctor while trying to also manage this business. And again, what he does on the insurance side or is the personal injury side are two almost contradictory practices. And so what I mean by that is he gets paid up at flat fee per month to take care of all these patients. He gets a little bit extra for, you know, each procedure he does. But he is almost incentivized to make it harder or more difficult for these patients. patients to come in, because he gets paid the same amount per month, whether he sees one patient or a hundred patients.
00:31:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That sounds very contradictive to what you're trying to do.
00:31:10 - Chona Sweet
So I don't want to cut Mark because we already established a key busy. I feel like he wanted someone to drive this, but here's my problem. I feel like I'm walking an eggshells, not with him, but with his office manager. So, you know, Cheryl. Cheryl wants to be involved with all of this. I don't know what kind of pay structure he did with her. I feel like he did also something else with PI with her, and he or he wants her to always be involved on the back end because he wants to take control on this PI cases.
00:31:49 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
But even another layer to it, he won't let her negotiate on the billing for PI.
00:31:54 - Chona Sweet
He wants to be in control of the money side of it. No, he does. She negotiates the PI too, but she gets frustrated. because the lawyers always, you know, negotiate down, so she doesn't like that, but she, she, I've talked to her multiple times because I wanted to be on her good side too. I wanted to understand how the practice works. She wanted help, but at the same time, I don't know if she's ready to let the rain go, you know. So, because when I asked her, if I have a new client that's coming from me, how does it work? And she once, and she, wants her to be emailed first. And that's what Mark and I are trying to avoid, is steer away from that, create a universal email where I am CC, where it will go to me, go to Cheryl, go to Cass, and go to E. But that's the email that Mark is talking about. Beyond that, it's the politics of me trying, I feel like I'm walking on eggshells with Cheryl, today. that I have a new patients for tomorrow, I already make a schedule and then they ask do you want me to call the patient schedule? No, I already did all that. Because again, I wanted to drive this, I wanted to make sure that I'm in charge on making sure there's appointments. again, that's where my frustration is at, other than no structure. But we are overwhelmed with the new patients coming in because of this optimization.
00:33:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And new patients, not PI patients, they're regular.
00:33:28 - Chona Sweet
PI, this is the regular patient of the clinic.
00:33:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so there's a lot of moving parts in there and personalities and roles. And that's what I was talking about too, having a conversation like understanding what drives and motivates Cheryl. Chona, I don't know that you were there for the conversation, but we were talking about how can she take stuff off of Cheryl's plate or how can she make it better because
00:34:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm sure, so like Mary, this is kind of, I don't know possible.
00:34:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cheryl's married. Right. So sometimes it's working around, sometimes it's working with, but first we have to identify what is the situation. I'm probably going to move in a minute.
00:34:15 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
She's driving me nuts. Go ahead. More than that. It's making sure Cheryl's still somewhat in the loop, whether we're working around her or not. If she feels like we're actively trying to cut her out. That's when there's going to be the biggest problem.
00:34:26 - Chona Sweet
Which I can talk to her again tomorrow. Every time I go see her, Cheryl talks a lot. I feel like I like her as a person. She's a dog person. I really like her. But her mouth and her mind are working really fast.
00:34:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry.
00:34:44 - Chona Sweet
Hold on.
00:34:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So do you know what she wants? Like what motivates her? What is she happy with anything in work? How long has she been told?
00:34:58 - Chona Sweet
old is she? Um, I would. Let's say she's, I don't know how old she is, but she's probably like early 50s, yeah, mid 50s. She has been with Dr. East since the beginning, which is, you're due to the 2017 honey, he's probably about the same or longer.
00:35:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
She's been around for a while, she's like theoretically quite like 10 times kind of situation.
00:35:24 - Chona Sweet
They have a very, they have a relationship like Mark and Mary. However, she is more vocal than Mary in terms of, and this is what I don't agree, but then again, Dr. E allowed that to happen, but she would call him out and call him, like when I say call him out, like they argue verbally, very, you know, other stuff and hear it, which again, that's their relationship. But, um, but her as a person, we talk and we actually gone into, you know, a deeper level. She, you know, it's just, she's just the kind of person. But I think she doesn't like more work for her, which she verbalized. And with this new up to 300,000 patients coming in, she's overwhelmed. So she's hiring new staff right now. Um, that's what's happening. So in terms of the PI, this is not her priority, if, to be honest.
00:36:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, that's important.
00:36:37 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, that's, that's where I come in. She really thinks that I will help her off low without taking it away from her. That's what it sounds like to me.
00:36:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is a very clear distinction. Um, so then you have a conversation about that. With her? Well, I think. I'm not really sure. This is this is one of those things that takes some finesse and maneuvering. So, and it works better with time, which is, he's not patient. Mark's not patient, so that doesn't work out very well. But Mark, so here's the reality. If you don't take time to finesse and massage it, either Chona is going to fail because that it's just not going to be worth it to her emotionally to do this, or Cheryl's going to leave, or like something is going to blow up.
00:37:38 - Chona Sweet
Right. Before we left, we added the lunch with Dr. E, and he said, he's going to talk to her about the clinic, but at the same time about the PI. Because he, Dr. E, he's supposed to hope. hire someone to be just in charge with P.I. calling the patients, creating that connection with the other lawyers or whatnot. So that is the plan, but the immediate plan is to create an email and phone number supposedly. Just for P.I. because I told him I'm going to attend in November, I'm going to attend this thing with Dr. Choy. That's a networking event. I need to be able to provide a card with the email and phone number that you want that someone will have to answer that phone. That's right now our phone system, our current patients are mad because they're calling no ones answering. They're leaving voicemails and the staff go to the voicemails whenever they can.
00:38:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I think one thing that might be really helpful and without creating a lot of friction is start with an org chart and roles and responsibilities. the P.I. structure isn't 100% knew he's done a little bit of P.I. right?
00:39:04 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Unfortunately, yes.
00:39:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Chona coming in and the arrangement that you have is really a new kind of beast and a new structure. So it might be good visually to outline an actual like org chart of what the structure looks like, maybe like a company within a company or whatever, however it looks like, but then roles and responsibilities so that there is a very clear visual without even talking to Cheryl about it. Coming to the table with this piece of paper that shows Chona is not a direct report to her that Chona is the head of her own little kind of department. Look, because otherwise you're going to have this battle.
00:39:51 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So You are in my spirit.
00:39:54 - Chona Sweet
I think you kind of know because we're contractors. knows that the way in her mind, because again, I've talked to for a long time, I feel, every time go talk to her is like three hours. But anyway, on her mind, she's in charge of the business side, part of it, the logistics of patient appointments and insurance, and also in charge with Medicare paperwork on the providers. The medical side is Dr. E, so that's how she's structured in her mind. So if there's a problem with patient care medications, it's Dr. E. But if there's a problem with, I guess, Medicare or whatever insurance signature we need to do, it's her.
00:40:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So within that, there's, what I'm talking about is delineating a difference between P.I. and any other patients. And thinking of that as almost like the silo inside of the business. So that, and within that realm, you manage the patients and the finances and the operations that now, Mark, you were making a face when I was talking about the org chart and all of that.
00:41:22 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So a little bit, because like, she's like a merit. And so in my experience dealing with have a thing.
00:41:30 - Chona Sweet
Anyway, what? No, I said that that's that. Unfortunately, like Dr. E, that's what Mark allowed to happen. Same with Dr. E, that's what he allowed for Cheryl to talk to him that way.
00:41:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't agree with it. Because because it's not delegation, what's the word when you you why can't I think of this word? It's driving me nuts, freaking hairy menopause didn't ever used to have this happen and now it's just like tip of the tongue. Anyway, um, an abdication, abdication. And Mark, you're good for that, by the way, abdication, an abdication, abdication, they've got it, whatever. Anyway, you're doing amazingly better now too, but this I think is a similar situation where it's like, out of sight, out of mind. I don't want to handle it. I'm going to, if I can yell at you and tell you to handle a certain amount of things and it comes within the realm of what I'm okay with, then that's all I'm going to do. And that's the situation. But the problem is you're trying to build an optimized structure within a chaotic structure that the two aren't very compatible. So either I mean, like, now if you were just putting a person into this, it's a whole not a business. You can burn through people. This is your wife. So Oh massaging it well and making sure that it's not like ruining her in the process is little bit different. But you have the ability to drive it and here's how you do it. The angle is always the numbers when you show people the numbers when you show them. This is what's on the table that we're not getting to, but also here's the cost of this structure not working properly. Here's the cost of you letting somebody be in charge who doesn't even understand the value of this and why it works this way and why it needs to work this way. This is what happens when you don't follow up with people and we're trying to build an engine that generates money. But it has to operate in a particular way because PI is different than everything else that you've been doing all of this type of stuff. But so if you can sit down with the data, whatever data you can have, it can be some forecasting and some projections and just say, look, this is this. This is what it would look like if we're operating a capacity, this is what the finances look like, this is how many patients we have, and then let me break down operations for you. Let me tell you how I imagine it would look like, right? One person has to be in charge of this. We have an automated follow-up system, it does this and this and this for scheduling. We've optimized charting, we've done all of these things, and then you really don't have anything to do with a doctor, except for you house it, and you hire Chona, and from time to time we have meetings in conversation, so we're all on the same page and making sure everything's flowing. Like that's how simple it is, however, it's only that simple if Chona is empowered to be able to build the structure that has to happen. So are you in or are you out? Like really, that's the conversation. Now, however you finesse that and negotiate that, that's up to you, but I'm telling you, the clearer you get, and the more data and vision. jewels you bring to the table. And I'll give you a reminder, every time we needed to get you on board to buy into something, it happened as a direct result of we got numbers.
00:45:11 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And then you're like, okay, and seeing it what are the issue that she was facing is if Cheryl thinks you're trying to go either directly around her or just not involving her in some way, shape or form. I don't know if she's going to go to the point of trying to sabotage. We're trying to make things just significantly more difficult.
00:45:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So hold on. So this is an if, right?
00:45:39 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And we can do if all day long. We don't know. Okay, with a relative degree of certainty that if we try to go around her cut her out, she will actively get significantly more.
00:45:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I agree with you. I agree with you. And what Chona is dealing with is alpha females type of thing. Like if you're the head girl in there, another woman coming in, it's almost most always, it does not work out very well. So, but, but Chona is not that type of person, but it doesn't matter, because it's their perception. That's all that matters. So, but this, this is why Cheryl needs to, I would have the conversation with Dr. E first, and then with Cheryl so that she could recognize this is a silo. This is a thing within a thing. So it's not about cutting you out. I'm taking nothing away from what already exists from you. And what I'm bringing in, you wouldn't have if I wasn't here. So, you don't need to worry about that. But here's what I'm going to do for you anyway, while I'm here. I would love to help you with some of your systems and some of your things and help improve your life. you can do that, Chona without taking too much on yourself. And I think that you can bring some improvement, but, but while you do it because your stuff is not her stuff, it doesn't matter if she adopts it or not, right? And it could just be being a friend, being nice letting her vent, like whatever kinds of things. But she needs to be able to physically see and wrap her head around how this doesn't exist and be very clear that it didn't exist without you. It's here because of you. You're not taking it from her. You're bringing something in new that has nothing to do with her, but exists in the same building for all intents and purposes. And either she can wrap her head around that or not. And then you guys have to deal with this and make a decision. Is this compatible? Are you willing to work under those circumstances? Or do you need to draw a line in the sand? And if so, draw the line. But either way, be very clear about what you are willing to do and not willing to do and don't put it in somebody else's power with their attitudes and whatever. Either figure out a way that's compatible or find somebody else to do this with.
00:47:55 - Chona Sweet
I thought, well, I talked to her. You talked to her, Marcus. me and I and her talk and you know that that is the the common thing that we're trying to say is you know how can we help you make it a little easier for you but bringing it in so like for example like the chat system that I start today again it's like saying hey this is coming you know it's kind of like me in a way telling them this is coming now and and so I think she is on board um she's overwhelmed with the new new optimizations but and I think Dr. E recognized the burden on her and that's why Dr. E said he will hire someone else it's more a full time because right now there's a part-time person doing the PI which is cast um which is related to Cheryl again it's very close to it but um I think we are there so it's just more of a rating I think right? Because we already talked to her about this. It's just more of really happening now. The main problem is someone who answers the phone. We need someone who- There's a lot of issues.
00:49:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, there's a lot. And you know, both Chona and are trying to figure out how to approach this in the way that gives her the highest chance of success, right? Because it's a lot of different factors and a lot of different factions. And his practice is obviously very, very different than what my stuff is to some level. Same time, it's also very similar to what I have to go through. And Dr. E recognizes that what they do currently is not going work for PI. Cheryl also recognizes that what they do is not going to be good for her period. So the good news is they both recognize that there is an issue. Neither one has a solution for the issue, but at least they recognize the issue. And so another part of the reason to kind of with light of fire under this, I guess, for lack of a better term is when people see that it's actually a fire that needs to be put out, then they tend to pay a little more attention to it and put some more resources behind it. So is that the most ideal way of doing things? No. But you and I both know, like, especially when I'm like, , we're really behind this month. What's going on? We started taking into things.
00:50:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then we mark, which is last time you called your vendors?
00:50:23 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What? No, it's the same kind of idea, right? Yeah. It's Joan, are you paying attention? So, you know, it's not saying she's not paying attention, but like you're immediately going to get her attention one way another by saying something like that. Yeah. Here, Dr. E is focused on making more money. That's the only reason he's doing PIs, not because he wants to help more people. Sure, that's part of it. But he's doing this because it's another income stream. And Joan is doing this because it's going to make her more money. If it doesn't make her more money, she's not going to put up with this extra stress and headache because this is more work and this is more stress than just clocking and clocking out. There's no doubt about that. But Chona wants to make more and wants to grow and you have to go through pain in the to get there sometimes. This is gonna hurt at the beginning. I don't think there's any two ways about it. Chona's gonna have to do a couple of things that she's maybe isn't comfortable doing because it's not all spelled out while we get it better figured out.
00:51:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think she's doing amazing. Every week, this is the perspective that we have to have and you have to take Dr. E is like every week, there is measurable growth that's happening. So new levels of awareness, every single week that are significant, we're only six weeks in. first 90 days of anything is almost always mostly just information gathering and topography. That's it. It's just mapping. There's learning and understanding and then understanding the layout of the land then coming up with the strategy. So the pace of this is already pretty good. And I know that you're like bigger, faster, whatever. But the reality is, I've built companies from zero to seven figures, my point is that those are small to big really quickly within a year, many times over, but the thing, and I've come into ones that I've just hovered around for like nothing and then just exploded, it happens, the pace of it and the structure is always the same, if they're going to be successful and not implode, which by the way, I've done that and I've watched people grow way too fast with their arrogance and sell too fast and everybody lost their jobs and everybody lost everything because they grew too fast and that was the main goal. So understanding the human resources and the human aspect of it and knowing that the brain can only process so many thoughts in the first place, okay, just learning, then learning how to optimize while also dealing with other people and their personality. all of these dealing with the pecking orders, dealing with all of that, this is a process that takes time. If you're not going to break it. Yeah, anyway, so it's on a good track, but you are the thing that you, it's an unknown. You're building in somebody else's house is the biggest issue right now. You have to decide if that house is compatible with your vision because you're still a homeowner of your own, right? You're like, I'm building a house on your property, not in your house kind of thing. So that's a better reality. So I still need to have autonomy over my house and can we cohabitate? So that's the unknown. Worst case scenario is it doesn't work out with Dr. E. You guys have learned a ton of things and you go take it somewhere else. But you need to, there has to be a possibility that, and It comes very powerfully with this energy of a take it or leap it. It's the power of like a few money. Basically, it's like, look, we know it's going to work. We want to be compatible. We know that this is your property. This is everything that you're doing. We want to do this with you, but understand that we're bringing the strategy, the awareness, the skill, the expertise. We're taking care of your clients. We're managing the tech, the billing, the whatever. We are optimizing everything and you get to read the rewards. What can't happen is you pull out the rug from underneath. That's the cutest off of the knees. What can't happen is you create a bottleneck that closes off everything when we've discussed having open flow and making this happen. So your energy, even if you don't say the words that harshly needs to be like, okay, we're working together, but understand.
00:55:00 - Chona Sweet
I'm driving this whole thing and that was the point is that we're driving so You know you brought out a good point because I feel like well first I'm new and the expertise and I'm feeling you know, I I going over that hump of You know feeling self-doubt or whatnot that you know, I wanted to drive this Within Dr. E stuff, but I feel like I'm not confident because I don't even know the the terms that's being used You know that that's that and the second thing about the building is he has his own thing I think the majority of it the main point is he still he doesn't want to let go of the full control because he obviously the contingencies of what if I leave he needs to make sure that he can control that Yeah, we started and he's gonna benefit that I can
00:56:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
help you with that by the way. This is just a conversation that you have. So sometimes I work with new clients and I'm not 100% sure that I want to stay there. And I will let them know that ahead of time. But what I will also tell them is if I grow with you to a certain point and I decide, you know, I want to go, I'm going to replace myself. I will hire and train and insert somebody and you will still be better off than you were when I got here. So you can't replace me and you should know that I'm that invaluable that I never had anybody be able to replace me. But what I can do is build a structure and train somebody and train the rest of your team and also be available for consult afterwards. So but what you should not try to do is try to own me, try to control me, try to pigeonhole me because I can serve the best being free to work my magic and do what I do. So yes, you're, you're new at learning these things, but you aren't just you, you're, you and Mark together. Um, you have just because you don't know the specific terminology and the processes and the way they do things doesn't mean you're not incredibly intelligent, powerful, um, innovative, all of these other things, right? So I go into people's businesses. never know anything. Everything is brand new. Like I understand business theory really well. And if I ask enough questions and get enough answers, there's probably no where I can't bring a tiny bit of value, if not a lot of value, but I have to be able to have enough experience. I have to be able to listen. I have to be able to observe. I have to be able to watch for a long time to wrap my head around it to bring any value. So it's all potential. It's all there. But if nobody answers questions for me, if nobody lets me watch anything, I can't give anything. So there's no point in me being there and if that's okay, if I'm not wanted and I'm not needed, then I shouldn't be there in the first place But we're under the premise that you're wanted you're needed to facilitate this particular thing Therefore you need to be given all the things that you need to including the time and the space To wrap your head around what exists there rather than coming in with a grenade and going okay We're gonna just build this and blow everything up. No, we're going to figure out how to be symbiotic We're going to figure out not only just how to coexist with each other, but you feed me I feed you we're nurturing and nourishing each other in This thing that comes with strategy strategy has to come with knowledge and wisdom and experience which only comes after certain amount of time but somebody has to be able to Articulate that and have that conversation and make sure that there's an awareness that this is what's happening because most of time and people are like freaking neanderthal level conversations, money, faster, let's go. Okay.
00:59:08 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know what you're talking about.
00:59:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I wasn't honestly, Mark, I've got lots of experience with lots of people and you are not that brute force. I mean, I hear it, but then you're like, yeah, yeah, I get it. I'm talking about there really are people that just can't even comprehend the things that actually have to happen at all. You have at least beacons of awareness that fles for a moment.
00:59:35 - Chona Sweet
Yeah. I think, you know, even Dr. E, one did he say that he told that to me I think a week ago, I think he's also trying to think in his head if I'm worth this. And I think when he, when I was taking care of a meeting patient and I called whatever, I forgot exactly what happened. But he said, actually you do. feeling, helping with the lean cases now is, you know, is really worth it. He said that verbally. So it's like, okay, that's good in my life.
01:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to give you a strategy that you can use. And that is, you know, when you're wanting to ask for something and do something. So not only can I help take the lean cases off of you and ease your burden there, but I can also add blank. So you want to remind him what he's already acknowledged. And you want to remind him that the because because people forget, Jonah, they forget what's good. They forget what's right in front of them. They forget the value. People do that. They do it in their relationships. They do it in their habits. It's just it's human nature. So you want to remind him there's already proven value. I'm going to bring more. You didn't even know like this could happen and how good this would feel. Now, you know what this feels like, wait till we actually get going. So kind And I suspend your stress and your doubts and your disbelief and, you know, let's get at it.
01:01:07 - Chona Sweet
Speaking of the devil, he's actually calling me.
01:01:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
can call back and do a conference call with me, you and him.
01:01:15 - Chona Sweet
You want me to talk to him for his waiters, other stuff we need to talk and I'll call you.
01:01:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Plus, I mean, to me, you work with plenty of these types of founders and everything. They get excited by Shiny Ball without any help. That's him.
01:01:28 - Chona Sweet
That's you and him.
01:01:32 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So, hey, here's Shiny Ball with how this coming through, because it's been 45 days, so like the newness of Chona is kind of wearing off like, yeah, because you I mean.
01:01:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't mean she's not. No, no, no, no. I do get you. That's why I said, oh, but that's actually the perfect timing to do the numbers and the forecasting that I'm talking about. And look at on paper, this is what we're talking about, and then saying, this is like, so then you reverse engineer it. So what's the capacity? Then reverse engineer that across the timeline and go, okay, well, here's where we're at now. You know, if we grow at 5%, 10%, whatever, and make it a reasonable, taking all the things into account, like how, what we could do that. So what does that pace look out? How far are we away from this number? And if you're going six months, nine months down the road, and that seems like forever, it's not, because how else are you going to get there? six months or nine months from now have all that revenue coming in, and this additional stream with all this new systems and understanding, and you just, that you could potentially go apply somewhere else, like a whole new level of awareness on top of the revenue stream. You can't wait six to nine months to, to let that be built out and, you know, deal with a little extra.
01:02:53 - Chona Sweet
Like, where does he think he's going to go get that revenue without any effort anywhere else? Right. I think the only number that, You know, Mark told him that he's kind of that his goal to reach is the 400 patients a month that cap that mark that's from that He can calculate how much it will be Do the calculations for him in a spreadsheet?
01:03:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can do it on our next week's call if you want to we can do it in the middle of week We can have a separate meeting to do it whatever, but and we can we could do a little whiteboard It's too late right now to be able to do that. gotta go check on my daughter But that we could do that together or you guys can do it, Mark You've got it. You've got enough experience to do that, but basically What is the pace potential so I know from Fuji's marketing and his timeline like 18 months from now for sure You guys could be doing that But you know with all the experience that you have and and the SEO cuz Fuji did his own SEO So you're also a jerk into difference that Chonazim is an advantage that Fuji doesn't
01:04:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And the reason with the people I work with of, hey, there's a conflict, but I want to make sure, you know, show those taken care of with working with good people makes total sense.
01:04:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, nine months from now, that's an entire possibility, but, dude, get out of the way, like, either you want it or you don't, you don't get to want to and control the things that you don't understand. Yes, you're the doctor, but there's more to the business aspect than having a medical degree and going and handling the patients and even owning the business. Like, this is his, this is not his realm. You're coming in and you're taking the mental load of it, organizing it, masterminding it, structuring it, and facilitating it.
01:04:46 - Chona Sweet
So, my question is this, before right now, short term, if I talk to him right now, and he said, did you guys do the emails? That's no. Okay. So, I'm going to have all new, I need my business card with my email then. then I will be the point of contact from this for this new patient as of right now. And then the second one would be phone numbers. Now, this is what I wanted to ask you, and also I'm going to ask myself, do I put my phone number there for right now? That's my question. It's like, can I really do that? What if I'm with the patient talking to a patient and all of sudden there's a lean call that I have to answer or...
01:05:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, I'm going to be to backtrack. So building the optimal system means doing things the wrong way once in a while. Sometimes you don't know until you try it, and then you might get a Google voice number that's not your actual number so that it's separate just for this business with that face for Mark.
01:05:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He told me to do this for two months straight.
01:05:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because you want to be able to segment things and not have your number be attached to all these things.
01:05:57 - Chona Sweet
just opens up a can of worms. Oh, that's the best.
01:06:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You could do Grasshopper, but Google voice is easier, it's cheaper, it's less hoops, it's a shorter learning curve, I mean, it depends on what you need to do, if you need to have a complicated phone tree, then Grasshopper would be better, because I'm not the pending pincer miserly, but I also do the level of intuition that's needed to be able to organize it. The bottom line is figure out what you need to happen, how you need the calls to be handled. If there are options like logic, if this then not, if they're calling at this particular time, if I want to be able to press this number, if I want people to be identified ahead of time. Like if you, and probably would be useful if you really think this through like, how could I process different types of people, can I give them option one if you need this option two if you need that, Grasshopper would be great for that, and then you can actually use the phone system to kind of help process people. Faster even just by putting them in the right category priority, whatever. So, you know, I you're triaging right I get to this person faster because they Raise their hand for this and that type of thing.
01:07:11 - Chona Sweet
So Then the grasshopper do like if there's a number that I choose and we'll put it on the That will be the one that we will send out Can it be one transferred? to a different number once we have the main person who is gonna be answering calls or what once we have the Ask them the questions because all numbers have different transfer rules depending on where you're transferring from and to the reason I was suggesting grasshoppers That's why I use my first start my firm.
01:07:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I've used it.
01:07:43 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's it's it's a great service Yeah Yeah Yeah, and To your point you can make phone trees like okay, it goes to let's just use castes things It goes to cast castes and pick up then it goes to chona chona doesn't pick up then it goes to x then it goes to y You can make the phone trees, so you've got the backups, or you have all of them at once who are picks up, picks up.
01:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So the first thing that I would do is the two of you to do this together is map out what would be the most strategic way to process any types of call, right? If you could have the phone system working for you and make your job as easy as possible, what would that look like? Then you go look and say, can I do this? And what's the priority? Changing the number isn't the priority. mean, if you have existing business, it's a thing. could have some issue. could potentially lose some business if you change your number. But if everything's going, well, why would you change your number? Number one, and number two, people can, we all have cell phones now. not like there used to be a roll index where you went and write things down.
01:08:53 - Chona Sweet
You just be like, hey, save my contact. Okay, believe me, I've updated.
01:08:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
know what I mean?
01:08:58 - Chona Sweet
I did. Before I forget. I forgot already.
01:09:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait.
01:09:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I was just going to say, we don't want to use the Dr.
01:09:07 - Chona Sweet
main number because right now it goes to who the hell knows. Okay. I remember now. Also, I wanted to make sure that there is a way where we can delineate, okay, this is coming from Chona because if they call that number and it goes to pass, they say it's for Dr. E's. You know, that's what that's why I really wanted my email to be the one, the point of contact that the email on the card like here.

have the. I love the way you're thinking and so the hierarchy of all of this is first you have to have a conversation about what is the actual goals and values that are driving because if somebody has an issue with a decision that needs to be made, the decision supports the goals and values. And they're getting in the way of it, then, okay, something is not aligning, right? Either this is the goal or it's not. If this is the goal, what the hell is your problem?
01:10:09 - Chona Sweet
Why can't we do this? now, there's two. One from him that's currently on, which I'm also taking care of right now. And he said he didn't say the amount, but he said he will also pay me higher on those because I'm taking care of them. And this is mine, the future one. And he said it's 50% of each consult and 20% of procedure. This procedure, I don't get because it's coming from him. So that's why I really wanted to deal with it, you know, but that Mark said whoever he's not working now, but it's going to be very hard. But I don't think Dr. E is going to, you know, he. He's a reasonable guy.
01:10:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He's going to be going to vote. Really? like your show says his, he's not really going to like push.
01:11:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it makes sense even just like I'm on GoDaddy.com like Dr.
01:11:06 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
E. Payne.com was available. Like would it even make more sense to just build out a separate site for his pain management stuff?
01:11:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They went to quarantine to build it up. Probably, but you want to think about it a little bit more through just to make sure that like you've thought about all the things that you need to think about. That's all.
01:11:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Because two separate email programs can be difficult for someone to handle.
01:11:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yeah, what is the whole picture? what does that open? And is it going to, for one small reason, create more problems than it solves? Probably not, but I'm just saying it's not as like, yeah, just QKN doesn't mean you should. Yes, there's simple logic in that, but the business is complex and it deserves the thought about every aspect and what are the adjacent issues, secondary, tertiary type of. of consequences, potentially, of creating that. Does it trigger any trust issues? Do they feel like you're trying to siphon anything off?
01:12:11 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
would be asking for is OK first without.
01:12:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, right. But the answer to my point is think about it, talk about the right diagonally, all of these different ways, explore that. But the one thing that you guys could do that would be the simplest thing, and just get a piece of paper and write it out. So where do all, where does the business come from? How would this business be handled? How would this business be handled? You could take a picture of it and send it to me, and I'll create something more professional, kind of flow chart. Mark, if you could, and I'm going to give you a homework assignment, and Tony, you can neck him forever. But what do the numbers look like if we get him 400 clients? Like, how did the finances work? How does he get paid? I guess Fuji does it, but he has a whole team of people that help him with different things. So what I need to see is the game plan written out. If you do that for me, I will help you come up with the pitch to basically be like, look, this is how I need you to get on board.
01:13:20 - Chona Sweet
I will be able to handle it as long as I don't help with the main thing.
01:13:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I just need you to write everything out. And if you can kind of do it almost like a flowchart, my map, so the segments build the containers and write out like this so that I can visualize it. But also then I can help you with handling the conversations with Dr. E and Cheryl. So anything that's related to Cheryl, if you can draw a little circle and kind of show me what Cheryl does and what you can do to help. I might ask it'll probably inspire questions so I'll ask you some other questions but we will get a physical representation of visual of what's happening and then where we're going and how it helps Cheryl and how it looks good for her how it helps Dr. E looks good for him and you guys because when people can see we can literally on the same page because a page actually exists does that make sense um it becomes very powerful there's always an epiphany and aha like holy crap that's not what I thought it was every time right Mark so um we didn't get to some of the other things that I have but that's okay that's the pace and the priority has to be what it is so just tracking your time and having that awareness that you did have right you can only learn so much every week you keep coming back with this this new something so Keep that up, you need to encourage yourself and know that you can't do all of the things, but if at the end of every day you can look back and inspect it and go, I learned this, I did this better, I made this grow, got traction here, I got momentum there, whatever. If you have a few of those to look at every single day, there's nothing wrong. You can't be superhuman and you should go to bed with some peace and be able to relax and go like, I progress today, I move things forward.
01:15:31 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, it's, you know, for right now it's just more of me getting faster and, you know, with my between being patients and charting, because some of my colleagues, they do it, the follow-up patients, they do it right there and there. I've been charting after, I've seen everyone. I do chicken because, you know, I do my notes little here and there and then I kind of perfect it after. It's really just making sure I don't charge the entire night.
01:16:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. I want you to think of the driving analogy.
01:16:11 - Chona Sweet
Yeah.
01:16:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
01:16:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
in a parking space for 30 minutes doing nothing to implement your phone is not going to get you to a spot you need to get to either.
01:16:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. No. Decompressing. That's called decompressing mark.
01:16:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I will slap you. You're just called procrastinating too.
01:16:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't her sandwich. Then I know. Yeah.
01:16:33 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Mental. She has food in the fridge.
01:16:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She has it. Mental. I don't even think you understand the mental load of a woman. Like it's a whole not a thing. It's not, it's not picking. Like our brains are different. Our brains are different. So I could be wrong, but I'm just saying it could be just a decompressing. Don't be nitpicky. Damn. She's doing good.
01:16:58 - Chona Sweet
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
01:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:17:02 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You know, you know, but most of you are in better.
01:17:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, maybe you can like, do you get more and better? Yeah. Yeah.
01:17:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Not a $406,000 bag nice and sweeter.
01:17:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, no. Money has nothing to with literally got paid to $406,000 bag and we're both like what the F is. Why?
01:17:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I know. I know.
01:17:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The bag of my house costs.
01:17:30 - Chona Sweet
Okay. That's a bad world. It's just crazy. And there are people that.
01:17:35 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So how many patients do you need to see to get that? No.
01:17:39 - Chona Sweet
How many houses could you build in the Philippines for that? Seven. saying no to this is, you know, something wrote me like I wouldn't even dare. It's not a matter of weekend, it's a matter of like, no, that one. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. will make sure that I will, there are information. Questions I need to get from him like we talk about we don't know if he's done the email yet was a plan because if not, I will just push it to just be my email in that.
01:18:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Draw that thing out for me because I can help you with that conversation and Mark, there's a saying that you can catch more flies with honey than vinegar.
01:18:23 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So there's also if you're not first, you're last and second place is the first loser and I won't and so when you are in your death bed at your end of your life, what do you think you're going to be thinking about? You know, same thing with my dad that I still work to finish because that was all the way to the last day.
01:18:41 - Chona Sweet
So that's probably what's going to be for me.
01:18:44 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I just want to be realistic. know that's up to say, but I probably agree that would probably be how I end.
01:18:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Was it happy?
01:18:54 - Chona Sweet
Yes.
01:18:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right.
01:18:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm just, I don't even know what to do with that. think I was happy. My dad was happy.
01:19:01 - Chona Sweet
He's kind of drugged up. He was drugged up at the yeah, no forgiving too much drugs that helped him to sleep.
01:19:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
that's okay.
01:19:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How's this care is rough?
01:19:14 - Chona Sweet
It's fine. We have to.
01:19:17 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
doesn't matter.
01:19:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Neither here nor there. It's only theoretical. didn't. Okay. Well, we have wasn't leadership part of our studies.
01:19:28 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What happened?
01:19:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Leadership. Remember how we discussed leadership for a long time?
01:19:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
There's also jumping in and figuring it out instead of having everything.
01:19:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just go.
01:19:40 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Just go.
01:19:42 - Chona Sweet
faster. Now, I called you before to have us call and I don't know if you can hear it from me because I'm not sure of what even to say but you just you told me you're good.
01:19:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You're good.
01:19:58 - Chona Sweet
Okay.
01:19:58 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You're good. We're fine.
01:19:59 - Chona Sweet
Everyone likes you. I mean, works out, but it's of that talk, though, Mark, can we have more of that talk?
01:20:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What? it always works out?
01:20:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, just positive, like positive.
01:20:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I, okay, I'm only you.
01:20:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We have to understand the different drivers. Everybody has different drivers. some people, like, if you say that they're going to sit on their laurels, and they're not going to do anything, and they're just going to, you know, like Tyler. Tyler? Is that the right guy? Tyler? Right. Okay. Then there's other people who will take that little bit of praise and multiply it a hundred times over, and they'll want to go get more and work their butts off. That's who you're married to. I promise you, I saw your eye roll.
01:20:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, we've also had a discussion yesterday about how just hiring people is the solution to all of your problems, and having someone else do things is not the solution to all of your problems.
01:20:58 - Chona Sweet
We talked about that one.
01:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. How's that? How's that relevant?
01:21:01 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm missing something.
01:21:04 - Chona Sweet
Because I said, he mentioned about Dr. Dr. Fuji, I asked him like, how fast does Dr. Fuji talk to his patient and telemedicine? He said five minutes. That's not enough to get the history. And Mark said he have a VA virtual assistant that gets the medical history for him, all the relevant information and the type it in. And then I said, you know, like right now my mom had a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist and they emailed her the pre, know, type in your information. But, you know, that's that was my question. And I said, maybe later on, you know, I can have someone that can do that for me, which is basically the VA. And, you know, but when we get busy, that's what is.
01:21:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When you get busy, you're going to need to do that. But right now, the more that you understand about the operations from the ground. The better you will be at hiring, leading and delegating all of that to people, but for sure, but, you know, tuck that under your cap for some energy for later is that there could be help and you can spend more time kind of strategizing and doing in the high level operations and getting some assistance, but there's timing to everything. And at the end of the day, all I'm saying, Marcus, just be more encouraging.
01:22:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I would not be putting my reputation on the line. would not be putting how much time in her in general, if I didn't believe that she could do this and do these amazing things. I'm taking away from my own energy, from my own time, my own resources, my own reputation, because I want to see her succeed and do well and achieve what she wants to achieve.
01:22:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so all I'm saying is, no matter what you say to help her, at the end of the day, you're doing great because you can measure the things that she's doing well. And if you need help measuring what she's doing well, come to me, I'll be happy to help you with that.
01:22:57 - Chona Sweet
How can I get her to go faster?
01:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm coming to LA.
01:23:01 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'll meet with all of you in person Ronan's big puzzle do it. Big Can I come hug Ronan? I know Ronan tagged both Jonah not yesterday because he hasn't seen us in a little while and he was adorable.
01:23:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just get me a plane ticket and I'm come down and visit everybody and I'm just and then slap you once and I'll take a sandwich okay bye. All right Thanks for paying attention. appreciate that show. Mr. I want to go faster. The way that you do that is do the job. Write down what it looks like. What are the numbers if he gets 400 patients like what what is the revenue to you to him? Whatever what does that look like? And then we have to figure out what does it look like operationally. So how many patients are being seen every day? How many people like who's seeing him is Jonah doing all of that. So we need the structure that you're aware, written out, I'll have follow up questions, but from there, this is how we draw the map of, it's basically the treasure map for him to look at, and you to go, do you want us to get to the treasure or do you not like.
01:24:17 - Chona Sweet
Well, he loves to.
01:24:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, so get on board with the show him what he needs, like you're going to need a shovel, you're going to map, you're going to. Exactly, exactly, but it starts with that. So if you do that, and then Chona helps me with the operational imagery, then by the time we talk next week, we've got a really solid game plan for the next conversation that you have that really should be impactful. The only way it's not going to be super helpful and get you. To do some traction with him is if he's just not actually wanting what he says he wants, but then you'll know, because if it's that in his face and clear. here. And he's still cognitive dissonance, right? Saying one thing and doing another, then you need to make a decision like, because if people can be faced with all of that and still operate contrary to what they say they want with all the evidence, that is not going to change. That's a personality trait. That's an operational trait. That's not, you know what I mean? So, but then you'll know, and you'll know very soon. So, get those visuals. You know what the assignment is now? Yes. Okay.
01:25:34 - Chona Sweet
And Shona, you? Yeah.
01:25:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And also, Tina, taxes are Ronan pictures.
01:25:42 - Chona Sweet
Very happy to receive them. Thank you.
01:25:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, you guys.
01:25:47 - Chona Sweet
Have a good night. will talk to you soon.

## Quote 17

> I hope that you can find some value in these things and grow in power, purpose and peace yourself. 💙
-end post-
I’m Tina Marie, and I’m a business consultant
that has helped several startups grow to million
dollar businesses within a year, and others to
multi-million dollar companies in under three years
from their inception.
To tell you how I got here, I’d have to go back a
good 30+ years. I was entrepreneurial and geeky
from the beginning. At 8, I was learning how to
write programs in BASIC on a Radioshack TRS80
(think floppy disk and cassette tape drives... oh
yeah!) Lemonade stands were a little too social for
my taste, back in the day, so at ten, I was mowing
lawns and babysitting. By 11 I had a paper route
and made a good $65 a month. From that point
on, if I wanted something, I was the one who made
it happen.
I worked in fields picking crops with migrant
workers. I worked in school cafeterias and then
hustled my way into a job at a Law office as a 16
year old runner for 5 local attorneys when I had
decided I wanted to go into law.
I managed to get a full ride to college and then
quit.. Three times before quitting for good, when
I realized I couldn’t stand the agendas and
propoganda that came with the education.
Instead, I found a way to get paid to learn, and
started working in a call center that housed tech
giants like Intel, Apple, Adobe and the likes. While
I started as a technician, I rapidly moved up the
ranks to account management during my 6 years
there. I learned that I have a knack for improving
any environment I worked in via optimization.
My systems saved jobs and accounts before I even
realized the power of what I had created.
After the birth of my second (of four) daughters,
I decided to figure out how to replace my full
time income from home. While I went down the
“SQUIRREL!!!” path that most entrepreneurs find
themselves on, I quickly (Within a year) realized I
could take my existing skills and find a home for
them online.
I’ve been growing companies as a secret weapon
on the inside ever since... all while having the time
to raise my girls, cook their meals, coach them in
sports and do the things that matter most to me.
And now... 16 years after starting online and 17
years after my first child, I’m sharing my systems
with as many entrepreneurs as I can so that others
can be as happy, fulfilled, and liberated as I am.
Working smarter and not harder is not cliche...
It’s an anthem to live by.
Follow me, and I’ll show you :)

Table of Contents
Math Is
Your Friend.
Chapter 1
Most entrepreneurs do not go into
business because they love crunching
numbers and balancing the books.
It is impossible to tell someone you are not
speaking to personally exactly how they should
price and package their offers.
This is my solution to that problem.
I am going to give you ten customizable scenarios
with different types of products and packages that
you can plug into your business (with a little brain
power from yourself) that should help you see
what you can change to get more profits out of
your business, with very little additional work other
than creating the offers and writing them up.
Most entrepreneurs get started because they are
unsatisfied with the status quo in some way or
another and find the only solution is to create their
own paths.
We venture out on it and learn as we go. And while
there are tons of great programs that teach how to
SELL or even WHAT to sell...
There is very little spoken about how to package an
offer and what prices to use to hit your goals.
There is a reason for that...
Start With
“Why”?
Chapter 2
Why is it so hard to charge the right
price?
If they cannot do it at all... obviously you have
value.
If you can do it FASTER or BETTER than they
can... you have verifiable value.
When YOU are your product, how you value yourself
has EVERYTHING to do with this struggle.
Here are some things you need to consider in
your mind when you figure out your value to your
clients:
Could they do what you (or your product or
service) will do for them, or as well or as fast as
you could?
Mindset.
Chapter 3
You Actually Are
Expert Enough.
Chapter 3: Part 1
Most unpaid experts don’t yet consider
themselves expert enough to charge
money.
Easy deal, right? That food is going to cost him
money and time, and you’re okay with that, right?
Why? Because you gave him value and you both
know it.
Well... when you’re giving value to a complete
stranger who you are only interacting with
through websites, text, videos and other marketing
materials... even socially on the interwebs...
Trading BBQ for your genius skills isn’t really going
to pan out. And the bottom line is: If you don’t
charge properly you will end up broke.
If you know more than the average person does,
and you can help them do something they could
not do as fast or as well as you can help them to
do, then you are expert enough to charge money.
Money is simply the currency used to exchange
value
Look, let’s say your neighbor wants you to come
help him on the computer because he’s a
technoob and well, you’re awesome. But, because
he’s your friend and lives next door... he doesn’t
offer money, he offers to send you over some of his
killer BBQ when he grills this weekend.
Being Broke
Helps No One.
Chapter 3: Part 2
You are not going to be around to help
anyone because you’re broke and
depressed.
But the economy needs you to contribute!
You have a serious obligation to go out there and
compete for business and serve YOUR MARKET.
You know... the ones who don’t want to do business
with that douchebag Steve who may be as good
or even a little bit better at what you do, but isn’t
worth the investment.
Sound a little brutal? I know. But... YOU KNOW I’M
RIGHT.
So stop arguing with me and with yourself and
listen up.
Getting paid properly is the way to feel free and
happy AND it’s the way to ensure you have the
resources you need to continue to hone your
craft and offer your products and services to the
marketplace.
I don’t want this to go to your head or anything...
Why You and
Not Some Other
Expert?
Chapter 3: Part 3
There are a ton
of reasons why
people will want
to pay you and
not someone else.
I don’t want to spend a long time on this so just
think about how you’ve chosen one person over
another simply on feeling instead of value. If you
show up and do the work, you can find a way to
get a piece of the market.
That’s my pep talk.
If you need one on one advice, you can always some time with me for a little tough love.
(Paid of course... I KNOW MY VALUE)
Pricing and
Packaging.
Chapter 4
Remember, I don’t
know exactly
what you’re doing
and what you’re
offering or how
good you are.
If you feel like you’re not good enough to charge some of these prices... lower them.
Then... improve your skills. That being said... Here’s a good rule of thumb to follow.
If you’re offering one on one consulting time or group coaching (and you’re not a
TOTAL narcissist)...
10% Rule
of Thumb.
Chapter 4: Part 1
Take the highest price you’re
comfortable with charging and then
ADD 10% to that price.
Let’s talk about the different types of products
and services you might offer. This is going to
relate to digital products and virtual services. Any
physical products could be added in as well...
just remember to calculate your profit margins
accordingly.
Once you start getting sales at your price,
incrementally increase your price by 5-10% for
every new customer you take on until you stop
getting conversions.
DON’T BE THE ONE TO TELL YOURSELF NO!
Let your customers tell you what they will pay.
*note – correct pricing and packaging for value isn’t going to be
enough if you don’t know how to pitch your offer. If pitching is hard
for you, study the book called “Pitch Anything” and work on that
skill. It will serve you well in many areas of life to improve this one
skill.
Lead With
Value.
Chapter 4: Part 2
First of all, I’m a big believer in leading
with value.
I grow businesses in many different ways. One of
them is helping entrepreneurs craft solid offers and
clear their head trash so they can actually pitch
them and make money.
I found that is SUCH a common problem that I
decided I would give as much help with that as
possible, free of charge. Obviously, it would work
better one on one... but this is a way I can serve my
market and find potential leads.
Do the same thing for your market.
You’re reading my “lead by example” version of that
right now.
I want you to get some value from me and KNOW
I’m worth investing in before I ever ask you to
invest. If I can’t do that, I’ll probably not convince
you I’m worth your time anyway and that’s just not
a foundation I can build on.
So find a way to create something of value for your
market that you can give away. Create something
that complements OR supplements what you
already do.
Map a Value
Ladder.
Chapter 4: Part 3
The next thing
you will create to
ascend them up
your value ladder
is a low level
offer, sometimes
referred to as a
trip wire.
You can have many different entry points into your marketing “eco system”... it does not have to be simply
linear... but for the sake of simplicity and what I like to focus on, “Fastest Path to Cash” let’s consider a linear
value ladder starting with free, to low cost and upwards.
Your low cost product should be something that can solve ONE specific problem for them. It should be easily
digestible within one to two hours and should allow them the ability to implement within a day.
The price here is between $6-$20. There’s so many ways you can validate that your product (ebook or video
training work really well) is worth more than dinner for two.
It may take you a while to think about why... but think it out.... Write up those bullet points and look at it. When
you look at that and say “That’s a no brainer”... You’ve got a winner.
Don’t
Overthink It.
Chapter 4: Part 4
Remember to
make it easily and
quickly digestible
and actionable!
The problem you will want to solve is not so much
how to give value, not if you know your stuff.
It’s going to be more about demonstrating the
value in a product they haven’t seen yet well
enough to get them to part with their money. So
focus on this part!
Pretend it’s your best friend and you want them to
understand why they HAVE to have this. You would
tell them:
• Benefit!
• Benefit!
• Benefit!
• Benefit!
• Benefit!
What are the benefits of your product? Get CLEAR
on that and making the pitch will be a lot easier, as
will choosing the price.
Your
Core Offer.
Chapter 4: Part 5
The next offer is going to be your core
offer.
This is the one that should bring you the majority
of your income. All of your marketing and products
will be leading up to THIS product or service that
allows you to give max benefit to max audience
size.
My preference is that this is scaleable, so it’s a
digital product or training that modulated and
self-paced (online membership course etc) with
possible weekly trainings, live videos, q and a etc
inside of a group.
This lets you leverage your time while being
able to serve more people at a solid price point.
Upsells.
Chapter 4: Part 6
Upsells are not created to be just one
more possible way to squeeze money
out of a prospect.
Once you’ve shown them value at each level, they
are much more likely to want more from you and
be willing to pay higher prices if you continue to
offer them what they want.
Upsells are going to solve a problem that not
everyone in your market need solved, but the ones
who do need it solved understand the value of it.
I’ll use one of my own value ladders as an example:
It has to be purposeful and make sense for your
market.
Keep this in mind... people that pay the least
expect the most.
It’s harder to sell people on free and $5 than it is to
sell the RIGHT person on $200 or more.
The person who’s focused on VALUE rather than
dollars (no, they are not the same) is going to
be willing to spend more.

optimization skills validate the investment.
Applying this to your offer.
Think hard and DON’T undervalue yourself.
Okay... Here’s the worksheet to help you with some
numbers and seeing HOW fast things can add up
to $10k a month for you.
Did I just hear you say “Finally!!!!”???
I better not have!
I had to warm you up to know what to plug in there,
Speedy Gonzales.
Without context, the numbers don’t mean anything.
If you got to this point and skipped the rest above...
Slap yourself on the wrist! Then go back up and
read it.
The strategy is to segment what you offer into a
value ladder that you can ascend your customers
up through.
Use benefit bullet points to help you figure out what
a price is for these offers.
Think about how much time and stress your
product or service will save them.
Use reference points like minimum wage hours
worked vs. expert hours. If you gave them,
effectively, an hour worth of your time, is that not
worth twice minimum wage?
Is it worth dinner for two? Is it worth ... Well... What is
it worth?
Example
Scenarios.
Chapter 5
Scenario One:
Lowballed.
Chapter 5: Part 1
Lowballed.
When you’re too afraid to charge much... do you see how many sales you have to make in order to hit $10,000
a month? Ask yourself... is it harder to charge more and get fewer people to say yes or to charge less and get
more people to say yes?
Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue
TripWire $5 750 $3,750
Core Offer $20 150 $3,000
Upsell 1 $67 50 $3,350
Total Revenue $10,100
Scenario Two:
Bump the Core
Offer.
Chapter 5: Part 2
Bump the Core Offer.
Here, doubled the TripWire cost, but it’s still only $10. We bumped the Core Offer price $7 and left the upsell
the same. Here’s the thing. With this offer, you need 315 LESS “yes’s” to get to $10k a month.
When you think about what’s harder... getting a yes or a yes at a few buck higher... usually it’s just the “yes”
that’s scariest. I told you... MATH IS YOUR FRIEND!
Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue
TripWire $10 500 $5,000
Core Offer $27 100 $2,700
Upsell 1 $67 35 $2,345
Total Revenue $10,045
Scenario Three:
Bump in Price +
Conversion.
Chapter 5: Part 3
Bump in Price + Conversion.
Again... just a few tweaks to the price and now we need even less sales to hit that number.
Something to think about is the percentage of conversions that take the offer. The higher you can increase
your conversion rate from TripWire to Core Offer to Upsell, the more sales you get, the higher value each of
your new customer becomes.
As that happens, you can afford to invest more to acquire each new lead.
Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue
TripWire $12 475 $5,700
Core Offer $37 75 $2,775
Upsell 1 $67 25 $1,675
Total Revenue $10,150
Scenario Four:
Vip Pricing.
Chapter 5: Part 4
Vip Pricing.
This is a powerful example of what happens when you have higher ticket offers available. With only TWO
sales, you just added nearly $2k to your monthly revenue total. See how fast that can add up?
Only two sales out of your 450 customers. Improve your conversion rate and that generates a lot more
money very quickly. EXCITING, ISN’T IT? Bet you wanna call up your old math teacher and thank them!

Total Revenue $10,029
Scenario Five:
Double the Upsell
Price.
Chapter 5: Part 5
Double the Upsell Price.
Here we upped the Core offer $20 and doubled the upsell price.
Remember, these are mock scenarios just to give you an visual idea of what happens when just a few
numbers change.

Scenario Seven:
Lower Upsell

Scenario Nine:
More Please.
Chapter 5: Part 9
More Please.
Want to earn more than $10k a month? Getting those $20 sales on automation isn’t that hard with a good
content or ad strategy.
Even with a ten percent conversion rate on upsells, the profits look pretty nice.

Total Revenue $14,317
Scenario Ten:
High Roller.
Chapter 5: Part 10
High Roller.
A few years back, Digital Marketer did a study that found that they could charge THREE Times the price if they
divided that price into three payments and it converted almost as well, only a 2% difference.
Instead of charging $97, they charged three payments of $97 and only lost two percent of sales. Payment
Plans are DEFINITELY something you want to consider adding to your model.
Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue
TripWire $20 500 $10,000
Core Offer $47 50 $2,350
Upsell 1 - 3 PAY $297 10 $2,970
Upsell 2 $997 1 $997
Total Revenue $16,317
Something else you want to consider is making sure that your tripwire cost balances out your ad budget.
Work on your conversion rate and prices so that you break even on any ad costs with trip wire sales.
In other words... If it costs you $2 for a new lead and your tripwire is $20, you need to convert every tenth lead
into a customer to break even.
Or... lower your lead cost.
Or... raise your tripwire cost... but that could hurt you if you go above $20 depending on your market.
If you’ve served them well with your free offer, you may be able to get more.

Hello. You're muted.
00:00:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Hello.
00:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi. I had a horrible asthma attack today, this morning. You're just on the Great Week. Oh, dude.
00:00:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You didn't know.
00:00:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The crazy thing is, like, I started, like, copying and gasping. My throat was closing up, but, like, the rest of my body, my skin was, like, on fire. I've never experienced that before. So, yeah, that is fun.
00:00:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it sounds like good.
00:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. I might call from time to time. I'm sorry. It's exhausting, but, like, my brain is fine. Um, my health is fine. Yeah, it's just like, yeah, anyway, it's wild. So, um, but I, um, my brain is fine. Not mostly. I, I have struggling a little bit still to get everything. Um, notes. Hold on. I have them.
00:01:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
How are you? Um, we covered, we covered you.
00:01:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We covered them. But I am really happy with my mission and getting to do that. And that's been pretty amazing.
00:01:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Nice.
00:01:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Doing this genealogy work and getting to have all these like spiritual stuff. have won't hear a quick three minute story. Maybe three. Less than. So, the work that I'm doing. So, we do, we believe that, um, have always existed, like, the Solomon, the temple of Solomon, things like that. And that we believe in proxy work for the dead, because not everybody gets to hear the gospel and be able to accept it and be able to be baptized. in temples, work is done for the dead by proxy. So somebody else does it on behalf of that person, and then they get to choose whether they accept it or not. So, and then we also do ceilings of families together. in the Bible, there's a reference to Peter having keys, and that whatsoever he seals shall on earth shall be sealed in heaven.
00:02:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And whatsoever he loses on earth shall be loose in heaven.
00:02:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So ceilings can be divorced and families can be put together forever exist in the family unit forever. So, we do genealogy work to be able to do that, that temple work for families. So that they can be sealed together so they can be found and and have that work done for them. So our church has got crazy huge genealogy like Before ancestry was there we had family tree and family church and everything Anyway, this weekend last weekend. I was doing work for family. So my assignment is really short I'm just supposed to append records of parents to children that are they were already identified, right? So it's like a this spreadsheet and Because people have most of the missionaries are really really really old and really really slow And they don't have anything else to do so they kind of me and or and they do all kinds of things and they get off task So it was given a time limit of five minutes, which I follow so I'm really doing this anyway I was trying to figure out for this dad because he had a Polish name and an American name Which name I should use because all of his records like his census records and things like that were attached to his American name, but I felt like I should use his natural born name that was on his naturalization records. Anyway, so I went off to pray for it for a minute and figure out what I should do, but when I did that, I kept seeing this flash of all these other records that I had looked at like super quickly because I fly through stuff. And I was like, I had seen what I think was potentially duplicate records, which is really common of the mom and dad. And then I went back and looked at them and they had 11 children, but only five of them were on one set of records and six of them were on another set of records. And so I was only supposed to attach one child. And I just started bawling, like bawling, sobbing, could not control it. it was like, I didn't see things. I didn't hear things, but I had this feeling of like there's all these people and they just really really wanted to be together. But in order for that to happen, everybody's records had to be fixed. The duplicates had to be fixed. They had to merge together. Names had to be correct. They had to be correct, whatever. And so I'm like, okay, I'm just going to do this. And like, it's almost like they're all hovering over my shoulder. And I'm sobbing the whole time. And then I did it and I did the last lady and I got to the last lady and she had nothing. Like she hadn't, she didn't even have enough dates to be able to go to the temple, even if she wasn't attached to her family. And so I looked her up and I'm like, well, I'm just going to go see if you have a husband. I'm going to see, make sure you have everybody once I get finished with you. And I found out that she died being the head of household. So she died living with two of her sisters. They all lived together. So it was definitely a really close family. And I had no way of knowing that. And anyway, but as soon As I got done, I felt really happy and it was just a really, I'd never had an experience like that before, and that was just kind of amazing, and with some of the things that you experienced, I thought, maybe that was...
00:06:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
All right, so what you're doing is sort of like creating a record that connects the records. were like, oh, belong with each other, but you would never know that. Oh, that's interesting.
00:06:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
because we have census records, social security records, new You can't go change those, so you're like, oh, I'm gonna connect, I'm connecting these thoughts. Right, so like FamilySearch and Ancestry.com, they have their person records that are created based off of the existence of those like federal records, birth records, voter registration cards, military things. Yeah, so like there's all kinds of teams of people who like read those, oh my gosh, census records, I don't know you've ever seen them, but some of them... Yes. Yes, they're terrible and the voter registration things versus like all of that stuff is hard. So there's a bunch of missionaries that just go around and they spend all their time trying to read those records and so they digitize them. And in two weeks, we got 95 years worth of the work done. Yeah, I don't even know what it was. It sounded like a motor.
00:07:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I did not hear anything. I went away from my phone. Oh, don't do that, damn. I know. was like, what am I doing? So Denise's Italian citizenship project that I've been working on forever. They recently contacted me and they're like, we cannot find Margaret's birth certificate. Like, we can't find it. We don't think that's her name. I didn't know this until I didn't know this when the project started. So, Everyone in the family knew her as Margaret, but that was not her name at all. It wasn't her middle name It was none of her names her real name is immaculata Yeah, we we think her name is immaculata. I go it is I Just learned that they go. Okay, Then we can go get this record because we found that and everything else lined up But then what didn't line up was the name and And yeah, you're talking 1910 yeah, not only no, you know what I mean, and this is all in cursive.
00:08:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're like, yes Person and a lot of times they spell things phonetically, so it's wrong because they don't spell it all over the place Yeah, all over the place, right We I kept running into Joseph spelled different ways. I'm like really or the names are flip-flopped It's like a middle name Or they give the nickname and that's not actually their name.
00:08:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so I'm spending with their zippy even though
00:09:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got his name.
00:09:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He changed his name to Joseph. His name was never Giuseppe. But he called himself. Yeah. So in America, he became Joseph. And then someone just assumed, Oh, they probably mean Giuseppe. And it's like, nope.
00:09:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
His real name is like a Jessup name, which is in between them. It's not Giuseppe. It's not Joseph. It's Jessup J E S E P.
00:09:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, that's like Denise's dad. It's like, Oh, I'm Nicholas Leduca the second. And then the son is Nicholas Leduca the third. No, you're not. Did you your dad's name was not Nicholas Leduca? Like, was it wasn't Nicholas, Joseph Leduca? That wasn't his actual name. And then I said that to me, goes, Oh, yeah, I know. I got the why are you why are you calling yourself a second? Because he wanted to look like, Okay, no one's no one's gonna stop you obviously.
00:09:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's crazy. So I'm don't
00:10:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Getting 12 hours a week doing that and it has been like making me really happy Which is great because also because all these old people are so slow and are they are people Are is it like people submitted? Hey, I I need this done for me and then No, so it's a it's a genealogy Database like are you familiar with ancestry calm?
00:10:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you're just saying hey this person's in the church Therefore we're going to do this for them No, no, no, no, it's everybody so think of ancestry. We have a site that's just like it basically It's called family search and we have a partnership with ancestry. So Because honestly our church has probably got the most genealogists the most genealogical records like But the closest one would be ancestry, but it started with Family tree maker which was called my art church.
00:11:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, how do we know someone? How do you know which records to work?
00:11:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How do we know which records?
00:11:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What? The work on like you're you're serving like, hey, this one needs to be done.
00:11:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, what is that? Thanks for all. Yeah. So it's first of all, it has no bearing on whether people are members of the church or not. Because the whole point is that we believe everybody in order to be in the kingdom of baptized in God's houses, immaculate in records. Eventually, everybody's stuff will be done. But anyway, so sometimes they're found just because it was attached to a whole bunch of records we got, like social security records or an even at records or military records or census records. So basically every type of document and record naturalization records, like those, like that's probably how they found out about her name. Alice Island type documents. any time we get a document, every single person just gets put in them. So then they go through and methodically attach and try to find, well, do we already have some of your family in the database? And so they go through and AI goes through. Yes. Did you know one of the biggest revenue sources in my church is patents. The church owns a ton of patents like technology. It is so fast. When we ask for a change, it can get done within hours. No corporation in the world works as fast as those.
00:12:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
that's been a whole nother kind of lesson. I'm like, holy crap, this is so cool. didn't know this.
00:12:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't know it. I did not know it. Go ahead.
00:12:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What? How would you like, you know, the things that we don't know?
00:12:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We don't know. don't know. Right. Yeah. But it's one of the things I'm fascinated with. Anyway, it was just a whole between the like, you know, I was special side because we have those conversations and then I did not know that Denise was going through all that with her family. So anyway, oh, yeah, um, close to those docs, see them. It's just funny but interesting. It is. It's just the world is cool. Family is cool. The work to figure out family, especially when so many people are being pulled apart by technology simultaneously, they're being brought together. And like that's the whole polarization. Like people are either focusing on the bad or the good, but 100% the bad and the good are happening side by side all the time.
00:13:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Dark and shadow. I mean, shadow left all the time.
00:13:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Like Tina's having an asthma attack and almost nine, but also angels are visiting.
00:13:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So yeah. Yeah, I heard a quote the other day and I was like, I'll never heard of that. But they were like, it was something like the the brightest light cat. That's the largest shadow. I was like, oh, wow, that is true. Yeah, I've heard that before. true. The thought about that. So it's like, there's the dichotomy.
00:14:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I've heard that. But I've never thought about it with the yin yang type thinking.
00:14:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Totally. Right. Exactly. Which is also literally white and black. Right.
00:14:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
there is light inside of the dark always and always dark inside of the light. Yep.
00:14:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Totally.
00:14:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Boop boop. and tittishy.
00:14:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:14:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. now that we have had our whole spirituality portion of the conversation out of the way, let's go. All right. But it is the spirits that do the work. So let's do this work. Okay, let's start with another 71. So I can get an update. I'll rock it along.
00:14:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I just got, I got Lucy working on my special project. Literally, I just scoped it out for him and we ended our chat. He's I've got it, but he's now doing my thing where I mentioned this months ago, right? going to create a user upon form, submit, make sure that they can. There used to be an issue years ago that I think is resolved, but I don't know where if you already had a preexisting user, like checking out with Wu was an issue. But I think that was like a early days, Wu, like, Oh, yeah. Yeah, we probably should make something for that. And they pretty sure they fixed it, I was like, just make sure that if we create a user on form, submit that user can check out without issue. Hey, we'll do the next step. I sort of sketched out the next step, which was it would be return the PGT tracking data into user meta and attach it to that user. these are on creation. If they're PGD, PGT day, which would be basically our UTMs, right?
00:16:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
we, oh, okay, translate them.
00:16:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So you have PGT campaign with new team campaign. But then we have some extra one for us that we lose to a different way.
00:16:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you've explained that before, but I forgot that that's what that was. Okay.
00:16:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
use user. If they become a customer, we'll get pulled into Metarick. And then when they're in Metarick, I'd be able to say, hey, what was their PGT basically lead data? what was their PGT data, which would be lead? I might haven't actually do that. I think I need to create a separation between lead UTMs, the PGT and then customer. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm going to do that, but first I just want to get, like, sort of the gears in place and start spinning them and go, okay, yeah, they're worth it, they'll together.
00:17:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What does PT stand for?
00:17:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So it'll stick in my head better. Performance gravity tracker.
00:17:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:17:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay, get back here. Get back here. Wandering dogs.
00:17:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Bellers in the .
00:17:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, it's Bell. He's a wanderer.
00:17:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's my youngest baby's name, so. It's actually Isabelle, Isabelleona, but I call her Bell.
00:17:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Um, okay, so I start calling her Bell, like it's easy, or B, with B.
00:17:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That sounds like a damn thing. So then, okay, so they get pulled into my I reckon they become a customer and then you can go look at their lead data.
00:18:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, then I can run these custom meta reports. So what I want to get at is I think ultimately what will happen is I can attach meta lead, meta cohort, meta. Metric has purchased meta. So I can be like, okay, fill me purchases from Google, which would be, let's call last. I haven't really, I got to talk to GPT because it's not touch. They've actually done, they've done more than touch purchased, right? So it'd be like purchase attribution and lead attribution. I could be the way I go better. So I'd say, Hey, show me the purchase attribution that you have that says they purchase from Google organic. Okay, great. And then in that same view, I have their. need meta-exposed and be like, oh look, all these Google organic air quote customers really originated from Reddit or really originated from Facebook and specifically the quiz type, whatever, forms. Now that might not happen, but then I'll know. I think there will be a pattern in there somewhere. And then similarly, I'll be able to apply their cohort, right? So I've been collecting their cohort, post-purchase. So once their cohort is applied, I can then say, hey, go into the, have the meta cohort to that record too. And then I could go into meta, I can say, show me all the cohort zeros. And then look at that, look at the, all right, what was the purchase source of cohort zero? What was the lead source of a cohort zero? And start to figure out where these people are really coming from or where I think.
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. I'm going to see it.
00:20:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's pretty dope.
00:20:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How long is it going to take most you do you think or to get you that set up? And then you have to collect data.
00:20:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, and then so once he's done. think I can go, I think I can go backwards. Oh, yeah. So I think I could. So anyone that has a user record. I'd be like anyone that's a lead and it's like you have a user right now.
00:20:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean your customer. Right.
00:20:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So in Ninja, I would say. Hey, here are all the leads here are all the customers. Okay, now with the now let's get all these leads. And then apply post like back apply their meta. And then I'd be and it'll be thousands of leads.
00:20:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That would be really cool.
00:20:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay, wait. And then that'll be it. That'll appear. better within 24 hours.
00:21:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When do you think Moshi will be done?
00:21:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know, because the first go around, he's like, you can't do that. I'm pretty sure I can, but I looked at that six months ago. just now, I'm just chunking it out. I'm like chunk one. Create a user from a gravity form submit. Do not change the form. If you have to change the form, you have to tell me how it needs to be changed. And I'll tell you whether not I want to do that. So like, assuming, know, and he was like, okay, so if I take the notes, form a creative user, that's what you're talking about. Do that. And then as that user try to check out and make sure nothing happens. So I assume he'll, he'll probably be done with that within a day. And then I got to think through, then I'll look at the meta, the PGT. Like I was just doing this too. I'm like, what? is the meta? I don't know what the meta nomenclature is. Like it's, I think it's under school war. might start with underscore meta, then you can put whatever you want. So then I would just figure out my naming convention and say, okay, make this PGT that maybe run that by Norio, be like, hey, we integrate this into PGT somehow? Or just kind of go dirty at first, and then loop back around, Norio, which I'll probably do actually. So then once he gets the PGT applied, has a meta on an actual lead cement. I'll make sure that she's, well, that won't show up in Metarick until they buy. Well, so once he does that, then I'll go, okay, how do we go backwards? That'll be a bit of a, that's going to be a bit of a lift because there's no way to export all the gravity forms in one go. demanding they dump them all and merge them, it's going to be a bit of a pain in this. But it's doable.
00:23:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and what we've learned is the data is worth the effort.
00:23:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah, totally.
00:23:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Getting the good clear data is the way that you spank everybody else's .
00:23:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean, I don't know the answer to this, but I do know if I answer this, then I think I can do it.
00:23:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
can skill with it. I want to show you something that we figured out, and you may not think that this is very cool, but I think that it's very cool. have to go. Are you, are you on a mobile device? I am now, outside with the dogs. They are very interested in this dude on the roof next door. Well, it doesn't look good on mobile, and I think even if I screen share, it's not, it's going to look the same way, but I'm going to show you. Anyway, turn it sideways. Please. Oh, that was weird. Oh, she must be playing with it because it does not look good on desktop now.
00:24:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Dang it.
00:24:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll never mind.
00:24:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'll show you later.
00:24:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I figured out, though, actually, I'll show you on James Wedmore because that's where I found it. Um, to do work with me. Okay, so where's my zoom to screen share? No, that's a bit. I did not know with this. There is sure. Let me know when you see this wavy movie line.
00:24:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What? I see the song.
00:24:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You don't see the wavy movie line?
00:24:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I do.
00:24:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, um, well, first of all, I was looking at different sites and I was trying to find something, um, I wanted to model for, because it's easier for me to get somebody to build what I want if I can give them a visual example of this.
00:25:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, what I mean by inspiration, Tina, very familiar with my level. Yes.
00:25:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but what I like, first of all, is that I know that James attracts a lot of the people that, that I resonate with me, I should say in that way, that resonate with me. Um, I also think that he's very good at getting his message across and he's very just non-dushy, I think he attracts a lot of females, his vibe is just not not the whole, like, in your breaking up content so that it flows and you get, you know, like these big, big words, they're bright colors. It definitely seems to be attracting female colors. Ryan Lee does the same thing. And so, but there's, if I go to his home page though, watch because there's movement everywhere, which with 80D people really, which especially the women, it really captures it. So anyway, I was doing that, but this was really cool to me. I love that.
00:26:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
This would be updated. Hey, buddy, this is such an own page.
00:26:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, what was it?
00:26:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
On his home page is the chunk missing.
00:26:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It says this, which it needs to be updated. Oh, I didn't even see it. That's hilarious. So, I was like, I've never seen this before. How does somebody do that as an image? And so, if I gave it to chat TPT, I'm like, what is that? Can you give me the code for it? Because we were looking at it. I was like, it said SBC. Yeah, but what's the image? It's not an image. This SVG is created through code. This weight is just code. And I had never seen that before. anyway, so I have not all browser support them yet, but they're pretty close. Yeah, and the way that we'll just do something else or nothing. Right. So she had replicated it here on my site for me. But then I said, I needed I wanted it to look. Oh, I told her to change play around with the shapes to see what other shapes that we could do. And and that looks terrible. But she did have it replicated completely. And like, this is the element or theme. Oh, yeah, I can tell. Yeah.
00:27:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So those his. Oh, is that what that is? We were in the bet money.
00:27:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I was guessing.
00:27:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And so anyway, that's what I was looking for is trying to kind of do something like that. Oh, there's like a browser extension that will it's like a WordPress browser extension that will tell you all the deets of a WordPress site when you're on it.
00:28:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they'll be like theme.
00:28:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What's it called?
00:28:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, I forget.
00:28:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I used to use it years ago.
00:28:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it built with?
00:28:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, you can use that. I don't think they you the theme.
00:28:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
use that for just like, Hey, what's I just use that like yesterday for somebody His book like it was built on kajabi. That's why I was like, I don't Yeah, cuz it is from and it's probably WordPress and as courses are probably kajabi. Oh So the kajabi code is only on there because it's tracking or isn't using it to log in or wherever. Yeah. Oh Well, anyway, I just thought I don't think kajabi does all the fly in stuff with that blueberry element or Yeah, I that's what was really surprising to me. Oh, so then I went to see think if it because I was, you know, you know, I've been looking around for the thing to use and buddy boss was just too complicated for me to figure out on my own, which I don't need to do on my now own now because I got to go. But I went to, so I was just playing with all of these things, got all these accounts, I was like, what happens with this. So think if I gave it a paragraph that had all of my chapters and what they were about and, but it wasn't, it wasn't very long. And it's a I created all of the chapters in a module for me with a sales page, landing page, and an opt-in page within minutes.
00:29:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I got catchy PT. This is the first time I've ever been successful with it. So I started, I lost the song. So I've written this song, I had like, so I just sort of, I just sort of finished the song. Now I'm going to take it into full production. And then but while I was writing this one I had this other one in my head I was like I gotta go find that one. I'm trying to figure out which one to do next and I lost it. It wasn't in my phone. It wasn't in my G-Drive. I'm like, oh my god I cannot believe I lost this and what it was was just me mumble singing over a guitar riff but I Separately what I do is like I'll do the mumble singing I'll come up with the melody or whatever and then I'll write all the lyrics in notes and in my notes I'm not doing whatever and Then I'll go back and figure out the riff and you know when I go start record it So this I had done all that I had like this version of me play like what I'll do is I'll take a Clip like it's a clip of me playing with someone or whatever. I'll go. Oh, that's it. That's that's the guitar part I'm gonna write over that and then I'll mumble sing over that and now So I'll have like the original just us playing guitar then I'll maybe I'll edit that down and then I'll Mumble saying over that into my phone and then I'll go set. I'll be in notes. I'll listen to it All right lyrics and then I'll be driving around like singing it in my head and I'll go. I'm gonna go right that lyric But I never go back to or I rarely go back to that mumble singing thing, right? So that one I was like Oh, I'm gonna go find that and I could not find I literally spent six hours looking And I couldn't find it. I was like son of a So I was convinced it was in Slack I'm like, I must have shared it because I know that I liked it. So if I liked it, I would have shared it. So I'm going through six years of slack Trying not to Trying not to waste time by making and you can't search so whenever I'm literally scrolling through So I'm scrolling through And I'm about to give up and then yesterday. So I'm going through I did over three different days so like two hours at a time and yesterday I I'm going through and I'm listening to these various things that are in there. There's tons of that I've put into slack and I find this one guitar part. I was like, oh, yeah, I remember that. I never did anything with that. I'm listening to it. And out of nowhere, this is what's so interesting about this stuff. Out of nowhere, I start mumble singing over it. Never did it before. And then I just, for no reason, sing Ophelia. And like this sort of like, it's almost, it's basically the chorus and I go, oh, that, I'm going to record that really quick. Right? then I do the thing. I play the guitar part and then I mumble singing over it and I record it onto another device and then I'm like, oh, that's pretty good. I think I did that yesterday. then I went back and I listened to it or I did that two days ago and then I went back and I think I came up with it and I just remembered it. And I like, I really got to record that. So then I recorded it. Yesterday and I was listening to it. It's like oh, that's kind of interesting and I'm like What the hell is Ophelia right like Ophelia's from something right so I go to the church and I'm like I'm like who's Ophelia? Thanks. yeah, she's like from Hamlet. I got all here. Right and I asked you I go what if I wanted to oh no it said Ophelia was this character In her the Ark of her story was told through songs her songs and Hamlet and I'm like, I don't really remember that I go what are Ophelia's songs and it lists these four songs and like chunks of the Text and I go that's interesting and in my mind Right, but in my mind I was singing To her not about her So because the first lines I was mumble singing was like I was singing to her So I'm reading the synopsis and I was like oh, this is really interesting. Oh It's like, hey, what if I wanted to write a song about Ophelia where I'm singing to her about, you know, her arc or her stories, and it goes, oh, well, you could do it like this, and I you not. What it spit out, I was like, oh my god, that's a great idea. And then I started pulling its words, and I literally wrote pretty much the whole song in like 10 minutes. And I was like, finally chanting, but again, right, it's the person prompting it. It's like, it's not just, it's not going to just write a song. If you ask it to write a song about Ophelia, it would suck. time I've asked it to help with lyrics before, it's been horrible.
00:34:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it's also the fact that there's a huge database around. So it didn't just get to tap into that story. It got to tap into Shakespeare, like a much bigger library. So, like, if you had asked about Sarah, like, what is there a depth about Sarah, there may be something, but my point is, is that the sort of course of the information was deep.
00:35:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, exactly. There's a lot of people writing about that. Right. Good point.
00:35:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but even more than that, Shakespeare stuff himself.
00:35:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, totally.
00:35:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, he wrote over 100 plays. Yeah, and his all his information has been broken down. Yeah, that's that. So I had today based off of something I saw from someone. And I was like, Oh, a reference point that that that uses a lot of because like I use a lot of analogies and people like, wow, you should write that down. I've never heard that before. then like, Deepak Chopra and a couple other people. The right so minor different. I don't talk about the universe to talk about God. But every now and then, like, I use these analogies. And I'm like, if I could find a way to blend what it already knows about that. with my own philosophies plus because there's there's way more of his words written than I have written to train with. But actually what I really want to do is go get somebody to go through like all of my fathom recordings and find just my stuff, copy and paste my stuff like not client stuff, but because because fathom will say this is Tina. And then use that because then that's a huge library that that I don't have created. So that would be awesome. But yeah, that's amazing. Hold on second. She may be to go. And my daughter's texting. Who is that? She's got to go like over a mountain. That's what we call it over the mountain to this place called Metford and pick up a car door from a junkyard because she's going to replace her own car door.
00:36:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's my kid.
00:36:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's also going to beauty school. She does tattoo. She does like wild makeup and my kids. I think they're awesome You try me, but they're awesome Okay, um, all of the stuff is gonna be so cool. Oh How did we even get to the music stuff from Mushi FBT Oh, yeah, so just the pace of this evolution like here's what I think is going to happen is these Small solopreneur type people which you're not that anymore, but but the people like you and I that have super creative brains and Have a difficult time sometimes it's financially But sometimes it's just because you can't get somebody to get your vision which has been your biggest issue from the beginning We can train because you can train AI faster, right when it's good But but we're learning how fast it's going to get good like it's going to pull away, like your ability to get the bigger. Did I lose you? Hello. Oh, you're muted. You're not muted anymore. Can you hear me? I don't hear you, but I do hear like something.
00:38:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't don't hear you. What is happening? Uh, yeah, missed all that. Sorry.
00:38:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, what happened?
00:38:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Let me see. Couldn't get my vision.
00:38:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I agree. So, but the way that AI is evolving, your ability to be able to train it and train it quickly and be able to get some of the things done that you couldn't, just because you go. to it and it will give the instructions to the lay people, right, the other people that you need it to. But what I'm thinking is that this is going to be, so we've watched these different stages of technology and how it's helped small people, small businesses pull hard and fast up through, you know, to compete with bigger, like your goal of getting market share, increased market share, those types of things for somebody that thinks so differently, like you do, like I do. I think that there's, this is going to be like a catapult for people that are using it and I think that that's going to be fascinating because I think that this, I don't think it's the disruptor people think it's going to be en masse, like on a big scale, because most people last week was.
00:39:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh yeah? Yeah, so that a big part of that was tied to the reporting on and how the AI companies are not profitable, none of them are profitable, and they're not gonna be. So reality, right? we're so steep, and we're not even steeped in it, but we are, like, compared to the lay person. We're like, it's like, we're in the deep end. But yeah, all these, they're not making any money. No one's paying for it. I am. You are, but we're, we're unique. Right. You know, who's, you know, who's not paying for it? My neighbor on that side, my neighbor on that side, my neighbor over there, my neighbor over there, none of them. No one I work with is paying for it, right? No one I work with directly here is paying for it. Not one person. They asked me to pay for it.
00:40:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, yeah, and we're sharing an account. Hey, that's $20.
00:40:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh my gosh.
00:40:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's crazy. All my clients have it, but I have almost no clients now because I fired people and yeah, that's a whole nother conversation actually. Um, yeah. So actually, I was thinking about asking a question, but the question is just on, could I tell you things that you never repeat to anybody? They're not inappropriate or anything like that. Or like, pretty much, I don't ever talk to anybody about what we talk about. Well, one of them is related to somebody I never ever speak about.
00:41:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. I don't really matter who it is.
00:41:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, I'm like, I'm like a bald tina, like a bald. Except in case we like you just get, you just get annoyed and like you say things and I still think that you're a bald. just like, I would need you to be a mindful vault about that. Because the only reason I would hold on. Uh, uh, you, it's been a long time since he's posted, but have you seen any of the posts related to any government entities?
00:42:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, we're talking about Facebook.
00:42:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:42:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah. No.
00:42:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, he's made a couple of, um, references to it. Uh, SCC, FTC.
00:42:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:42:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
but, uh, I, I've literally barely done those. So, well, it's been a long time since he said it. And most people, I don't think pay attention to it.
00:42:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Unless they've had to deal with those entities before.
00:42:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sure. But he's been talking about it for years. You know what they can do to people when they're investigating, right? Uh, Yes. So that situation has been going on for like a decade. And, um, geez. But indeed, I get emotional. Sorry. It's really annoying.
00:43:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, please. Okay. That works.
00:43:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They have locked everything up that long.
00:43:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Which way?
00:43:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Huh?
00:43:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
For who?
00:43:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My guy.
00:43:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
For Dexter?
00:43:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:43:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, he's a good person about this?
00:43:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He hasn't for a long time, but he has.
00:43:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I've never seen, I've never seen his stuff. But I've never seen him talk about this. Oh, I've never seen him to harass Dan.
00:43:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, they are thieves. what those entities do is criminal.
00:43:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:43:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You are, you lose. Yes, okay, the only reason he stopped fighting them was because of me and he knew that it would just Like you can't you can't win.
00:44:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You're right.
00:44:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You lose But but because of me he's trying to play their game and just not die Right Not because the money. I don't I don't care if he has any of it And he's willing to lose it all this had cannot go anywhere else.
00:44:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I've not told his business to anybody Yeah No, no one I know knows who he is.
00:44:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah Yeah, the only vision that we're not married is because of this because and they can get into my stuff Yep, totally. So we've not been able to have the lives that we've wanted to because of this and yeah and it's it's it's the government like drag it out okay but on top of that um we have relatives who have dealt with cancer and being homeless and I've been financing everything um I really hate emotions I would just I'm fine sometimes it just like comes out and physically like it pisses me off because I'm like I I'm fine it doesn't feel like this but anyway um I have just been getting I don't want this on text or email so I had to do it on a call I've talked to Mark about it too because I'm not I can't keep up and I have to do something but I don't have an engine like I don't mark it I've always had enough for me. I have plenty for me, but I have been taking care of three other families for years.
00:46:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay.
00:46:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm I can't anymore. I mean, I'm going to I can't but I can't afford it. I've got to generate more money. And so I've been working on the course. But the problem is I have to hire people and I can't afford to hire people. I don't need a lot. Just to extract it from me. The whole course issue that we've discovered, that's the biggest thing.
00:46:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Somebody needs an extraction.
00:46:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so I have that. I have, I'm going to text you my little whiteboard thing. You can see this. You have an extractor come in. do.
00:46:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I do.
00:46:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She comes into my house. She also cleaned. I have to be able to afford her. And she lost her job. So I really have. have to be able to afford her because she needs it. And it's just another family that like, I'm going to take care of everybody until I can't. And I will do all that because I can make money. I can make all the money. That's the thing. have no scarcity mindset whatsoever. That's why I'm willing to volunteer 12 hours. It's in your text. I have so much energy.
00:47:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I've done so much healing.
00:47:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My mood is good. Like if you pick on it and like zoom in.
00:47:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I am. I love you.
00:47:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the orange things are concepts. green ones or they switch colors because those sticky notes are action items. So everything is a concept with a tactical practice. And then of course I teach it's a constant iteration. So these are the fundamentals. These are everything that we do. all the time, but I teach people that it's, you know, everything builds upon itself. So anyway, there are two things that I need. First of all, Mark sending me Fuji, the doctor, and he paid, I told him, so this wasn't my new pricing structure, and it's not for IM people because they can't do it, but doctors, doctors, lawyers, expensive professionals who have spent a lot of money on education who immediately understand the benefit of it. I said it was $5,000 a month with, you pay by the quarter with at least a 90-day commitment because I've got to have at least 90 days for you to know if there's anything.
00:48:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, yeah, we figured that out, yeah.
00:48:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. then, or $4,000 a month, but you pay six months at a time, and so he did that. So, was $4,000 a month for him, and he's immediately happy. His wife is so excited. His wife comes to talk to me on the— videos. It's amazing. I'm so happy with it. But anyway, what I'm trying to figure out, and I gave Mark a pitch, I've got to stop worrying about money. don't, it's sucking the energy out of me. I need to be able to just have the team. And you know how everybody else is like, oh, go to have this person full time. Well, I don't need full time. I need like 10 hours from my developer. I need 20 or 30 hours from Stephanie, which is my, she cleans for me, but also she does this. She has run businesses. She's a business. ran a retirement center. she flipped that thing around, man. She is a workhorse. So she, she understands things professionally, but she also is like my best friend. She claims she's like one of those amazing rare people that can do a few different types of things. And she is and I'm learning from her too that I could teach my stuff to people that manage who maybe they're corporate managers or whatever like there's so many different entry points like I would market it as though it's a completely different product but it'd be the same thing just with a different entry point so like same product but I like Fletcher yeah his theory is that you bring them in on any of the nine column headers here but actually they could all come in on the same thing it would just be the story is different as to why they need it yeah they're saying I need time management or I need how to build the team but in reality we know actually you need yes you do need that that's just the pain that's right the face that you have right yeah punch in the face you have right now but we all know you don't know your numbers so the pitch that I gave to Mark out of I can only call it does it what it's It's not just desperation. was, it was inspired by that, but I'm trying to figure out what is the thing that makes sense for somebody else. Like, I don't want charity. I don't want somebody just give money, but this is going to take a little while to build out. But I'm like, I can't even tell you, you know when you know that you've got all the things, I've got all the things. Every single time I teach anybody anything, anytime I have a conversation, at some point, somebody goes, holy , I've never thought of that before. And then there's something that they can go wrong with because the people I'm talking to have brains at their homes and they do really cool and exciting things. Anyway, and I know that I can market this. The reason I started, you know, showing up on video is just to get over any shyness being on video.
00:51:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's why I was like, jump on Zoom sometimes with video. Just there was a reason.
00:51:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, just conditioning myself. And, and And the point that nobody says anything. So I'm like, that's that's the whole thing. I need to tell myself, nobody cares. Nobody cares. So anyway, the pitch that I gave Mark was that I'm like, you're gonna be like, yeah, you got some brass balls. Anyway, I want to get $100,000 and not think about anything and hire everybody, build my marketing campaign, go nuts on it. I don't even care if I I've got people who cannot, they're going to be homeless. They would be wasn't for me every single month. Anyway, but but the deal is that I would give 10% of any money coming in and up to $200,000 or for the next 10 years, but it's going to be faster than that. So that they double their income period. In addition to that, I would give any time they want anywhere, but I want to be able to know that I don't have to go chase money. I'm gonna and a building engine. But the other thing is like, so Dexter and I have had a rule. I don't have male partners. I'm like, you don't get to dictate that anymore. I have to do what I have to do. You can be afraid. You can be afraid and break up with me if you want to. He would never. But it really makes him afraid. And this is terrible against his ego. If he knew I did this, he might. I think it would crush him. Which is why he can't know because he can't handle it. But the up you see will kill you.
00:53:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I don't have any other options not to take care of my family.
00:53:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But this is not coming from a place of weakness. I'm on fire damn. Like I just I have so much energy for working and building this out and this AI stuff with the Dev girl that I got, which you have your own team. But with Stephanie's help, Maria just It was something kind of to rip off of. She, that girl takes too much stuff on her.
00:54:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But, but there are. Yeah, she, uh, she's ping pong's around.
00:54:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She does. And I don't want to ping pong, which is why I want to be able to hire people direct them very specifically, no favors. Like I, the other thing is the girls, like I'm down to one, basically. The other one is going to start school. She may be staying here, but also I need to pay for her school. And, um, I just, I don't want, when you worry about money, it's Maslov's hierarchy, but it's also his paradigm. You can't think about higher level things when you're in pain. So I need to get rid of the pain so I can be high performance, but I feel high performance all over the place. I just am not working with anybody and I don't have the financial resources. And I need to figure out how to get to that. And if I can figure out a way to, but I, I can't tell anybody. That's the other thing.
00:55:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I can't help it.
00:55:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
two. So I told Mark, I'm like, can I give you a dollar? And then anything I tell you, you can't say because it's privileged. He said, yeah. Yeah. That's true. then mowed him. This was like two months ago. And that's when he got Fuji and he's like, I'm texting two people. It was like 11.30 at night on a Saturday because that's losing my mind per minute. So now you're in the loop. But I don't know if there's anything that you'd be interested in that we could do. I will partnership. I don't care. I will work like crazy. You could have ownership. This would be, I'm not even being clear about anything right now, really specific. I could build that. But it's mostly a download of information and your brain does things. So that's where I'm starting. And you have your own puzzle. I don't know if there'd be something you'd be willing to invest in with an income guarantee contract like you'll get your money back however long it takes kind of thing and obviously there's risk involved but I don't think it's much of a risk because I'm pretty sure you know I can do these things so that's something to think about and just whatever part of it would just be benevolence like a huge part of it that would be the initial thing I know that but the other part of it would be I'd make sure you get your money back I have no I made a million dollars in coaching 10 hours a week or less in six years but it's not enough not while I'm taking care of other families and I fired the pain and he asked people that were draining me So that's the other thing.
00:57:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm not making nearly what I used to make. Right. I have that as well.
00:57:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So, and I can't bring on just anybody. And I really want my time needs to be leveraged like everybody else's. I've got to build the course, but it's happening.
00:57:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm doing it. all you need to do. That's literally like if you don't, you shouldn't even be building a website. You shouldn't. There's no reason to have a website if you don't have a course.
00:57:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not building it.
00:57:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm making sure I have something to do it. It's always the time. Right. They're all, it's all sort of, you know, which isn't exactly accurate, but it's all like proactive. It's like, oh, I'll just go work of the website. Well, you know that the teeth pulling or whatever you want to, however we want to not authorize it. It's doing that bit now. You got a lot done though. So props, but it really comes down to that like if there's It's like you're building a house for something that doesn't exist. And it's like, you know what? Build the shelter for it after it exists But nobody makes the damn course like I just went through this with DK DK is gone. you not two Years he's been working on it And I said it's not with it. I'm like, dude, and he's getting hung up on like the names of the steps It starts really cool gives a So there's a 82 pages like this has to be this is not enough I have to fix it and then I know but I mean I can see it. I know you right. I'm looking I get I read the nine things I go yeah, there's really good like I don't I My feedback would be like, yeah, okay This seems like a good framework, but like then here are the bones right here's the skeletons Now you got to go throw the meat on it and then it's like, it's got to be, you know, so that when you do sell it, because the ease, you know, the quote unquote, easy part, right? easy part is building the funnel or whatever, right? It's like that's the easy part. Yes. The hard part is all the work that you put in over the years to get the know how and whatever, right? mean, that's ultimately what they're buying. Um, do you go, I'm just going through it. Yeah. And I mean, just go hard at this. Go hard at this and just get it done, whether it's video, I don't know what, however you want to deliver it, like, but like build the thing and then go build the parts around it, right? And then, then you get into the funnel metrics and then split everything in the blah, blah, blah. But it, and it might be, if you have this and then a website, then you can do a damn thing again, right? Go go to Meredith and like do that pitch. Like look back at things that worked, except this time you're like, I'm not, I'm not putting them in a one-on-one opportunity tonight. You go make a similar pitch, but it's gonna be for this. Yeah, and maybe some people do, as you know, they will, right? people are gonna go the Fuji path, but it's like I was on the horn with a hannock the other day. So like he had to fire the number one, the number one salesperson, and then that turned into a total show where she came, she came back and started poisoning the well and all this stuff. So he went on vacation, air quotes, and while on vacation, he worked four of the seven days, and he just keeps coming back to, I'm like, dude, are you just not seeing the part where like you hate the business model that you have? are you, when are you gonna get that message? You you built the wrong business and now you're you're like you got at this life preserver Oh, and then his his ops guy Went totally sideways. So the integrator dude all of a sudden start talking about how he doesn't understand Some of the metrics and I'm like he's just bringing this up now What are you talking about? But it's like he should he should have he's like I should ever recurring revenue business. I go yeah You should right so like you're saying yours is gonna be hybrid and it's like So you could end up with like I think wedmore. I do not like him by the way There's he just rose me the wrong way.
01:01:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's something off about him.
01:01:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Hey, I don't either but there no I know but I think his Yeah, his presentation is good and I don't think his content's great. Your versus better You have more probable probable probably have more actual legitimate success that he does, right? mean, he's slinging courses to people that are never gonna finish them.
01:02:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:02:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Which you'll get that too, but that's not your intent. That is his intent. His intent is full well-knowing, like, and that he's gonna upsell.
01:02:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I will get what I know I will get is whatever time they're willing to spend with me, they're gonna think a new thought and they're gonna change something. I guarantee you know what he's gonna go through any module and not think that even just slightly differently and operate just slightly differently. that's iterative change. And that's all I'm promising. And if you want more, you just keep coming back.
01:02:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So. And then once you have this feedback loop, it'll get better.
01:02:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
100%. That's the thing about being on the mission and everything else. Now that the girls are grown, I don't have kids to take care of anymore. I do. I have these, but I, the capacity that I have for wanting to teach and lead, but also I'm constantly learning. So very few of the teachers are constant and intentional students. I always am a student. Like I'm always, you know, how humble can you be if you say that you're humble? But like I'm very aware that I don't know what I don't know.
01:03:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I'm always learning.
01:03:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's the thing too. 100%. I know it's unique. So I can create this stuff, but here's where I get caught up and you know this is I overthink things. You don't be the only one that I know who doesn't sugarcoat things, who has the experience, who knows the benefits. So what I need to do is keep this minimal, sufficient enough that somebody can comprehend it. like MVP, right? Smallest actionable stuff. Can I get you to and I can pay for it? I don't care how it happens But as I create a chapter get your feedback on it and say I think you're missing this I think you're this is too much I think whatever because I will overthink it if I don't have some sort of feedback loop.
01:04:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
have to have it Yeah, totally. Okay, that would be really helpful to me I think that should be the short-term thing like Right like forget about the other Energy the thing that I need you to understand about other people. It's not just proactive avoidance. It's it's I know I said it wasn't the exact right word.
01:04:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yes. No, right. So I don't spend any time on it I talked to her an hour a week and it literally is mostly it's just like a battery pack for me So it gives me a little boost of energy it 100% is a placebo effect But it still has an impact of like, okay, it feels like there's something happening, but where my real time does go is this, is actually writing this stuff.
01:05:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So that's the difference that separates me from other people is I'm aware.
01:05:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, you've done a lot too. That's pacifier. I better be looking at it go, I'm sucking my thumb. Okay, let's go right. Anyway, but um, so if you do think about it, and if you can think of anything where there would be terms and maybe you talked around that, don't know of something where I would I'm not going to stop working. That's the whole point of this where you can get your money back. It's not a charity investment, but maybe it's a just it is a an investment that takes a little while to get back. If you'll think about it, if you're like Tina, that's just not, no, that's fine, whatever, I'm at the point where I can't be proud.
01:06:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I've been there.
01:06:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't enjoy that, by the way.
01:06:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I've been there. Well, I've also been on the other side where I've been too proud, both both are not great.
01:06:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Despite the fact that I like get emotional cry, I don't feel weak. I don't feel trapped. don't feel helpless, but I do feel like the biggest thing that I need to do is trust who I can trust, ask what I can ask and get by us to work and stay at work. So, I'm doing all the things, I'm not letting pride get in my way, I'm not being lazy. If I suck my thumb for an hour, we're talking to a developer, which it's just more about there's somebody that I'm training her how I think when the time... I mean, I get it.
01:06:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I get it. Yeah. Right. So, that was also before you showed me 82 pages, so I'm like, all right, you're doing the thing. Right. Because it's all about the thing, right? It's all about the product, right? You can... You have to have the product. I think you do have the product. Within you, right? It's like so and now you're making the product and then it's like okay now go market product Now I'll get the product out there, but where people People get hung up on never building you did too, but now all of a sudden right Or not the best reasons you're like . I gotta I gotta jam my nose against this grindstone. Here we go And you're doing the thing. So it's like, okay, great. And then I'm more than happy to help you Review it or whatever And then I'm I certainly will consider it, but I'm obviously going to be like All right, is this progressing?
01:07:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like what's going on? But that would be perfect because I Responded really well to that Right I don't and I don't give excuses I'll like stay up all night and be like, okay, here's something here says like whatever I don't have a Tina in my life. I don't have anybody that does that and I do needed. So that's part of what's so funny.
01:08:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Here's the comedy is that literally two months ago maybe three I told my sister you should call up Tina and you guys should For lack of a better word harass each other to getting your courses done like that was that would be the best thing you guys could do for each other and she didn't do it because in the reason she didn't do it is because She doesn't really want I think she does want to start a business But I don't think she really thinks she can do it and I'm not gonna say that to her But that's exactly what I believe and now all of a sudden she finds herself That was up The years up like she wasted a year like you should have spent I tried to tell her she should have spent a year Doing once she just got a coaching client for 25 grand. I'm like there are more but you're I, of course, you and I, you know, universe, religion, we want to call her. I'm like, she's closing herself off from it at like a subconscious level. See, it's telling herself it's not really real yet.
01:09:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
here you go, you just made 25 grand.
01:09:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. How many more of those do you need? And I was trying to get her with something like, you've done it, but she's never done it. like, what's the math? What is the math we're working with you? I can't help you if I don't understand the math. And like, she can't tell me, hey, I need to make this much a month of money. then I'd be like, okay, great. What I want to know from her is, how much money do you need to make a month? And how much money does Robin need?
01:09:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, what is your not? There's two elements that go into that.
01:09:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You got to live and you got a fund, let's call it. What is that number? Yeah. you can work backwards. You have the number and now you're trying to work backwards.
01:09:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's how you have to do it.
01:09:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So you can tell her, oh, I need to. make a million to our month, it's like, good luck.
01:10:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can tell her, because I think that she thinks whatever that I'm, I won't say better, but at something that she's not at, and it has my experience doing it myself has no bearing on it because she just, she just did it in a different world. So the valuation is what's different, that's all, skill and ability is not what's different. And her knowing that she can exist in this world is what's different because I know I can because I have. And I know that I do it really better than anybody else I know because for what I do make and how little I work and how little I worked for it, because it's all been word of mouth. I don't know anybody else who has done it to that level. So I have confidence from that.
01:10:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And dumbfounded by the amount of money you made up on, it's like dumbfounded. Yeah.
01:10:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I missed that.
01:10:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Did she really make it all by?
01:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
heard about it.
01:11:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, totally. She doesn't have a court. She should. She should have a court that she doesn't. But a big part of that was parenting and motherhood. I was just gonna say you didn't need to do it before. Right. At some point, it's like, Oh, needs to happen. And then the need or at right, it's pacing all the things to you.
01:11:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Exactly. All and it's all the things that I teach. So if you want to tell her, because that, like I said, I draw energy from the the riffing kind of thing. But it's very difficult to find a running mate from my brain. Lisa. I mean, she she and also she does like you that she's like, like the very first conversation we had. She's like, wait a minute. And like, like, yeah. she's very frank, which is amazing and awesome. And yeah, so if you could, I would give her we could give each other an hour a week and it would just be give feedback, give suggestions, whatever.
01:12:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I of bill a buddies.
01:12:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
01:12:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I still think she should do it. She did two interviews. talked to me and it was like, one, was like, if they offer you the job, you got to take it. And neither one of them hired her. And I was like, you are now your client. Like in my head, I was like, you are your client. Like, so what would you tell your client, right? What would they do? So she's interviewing for another place, but I'm like, maybe they're not going to hire you. But you know, she did the coaching thing or whatever. She never watched like her stuff. And again, I don't think it's the greatest, but I do think they're I still think like you can use it to come up with to sort of structure something.
01:12:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think honestly, if she looked at my carbs and what I think that she would go wait, these are the things that I do. So like, I just have to sit there, and that, by the way, that has come out over the last year and a half, maybe, of going, okay, what are the things? Well, and it did start with Fletcher stuff, but in terms of, like, I saw a road map, and then I was like, I hate all of this, let me do my own thing, but all I needed was to see a road map and to know, oh, I need a road map.
01:13:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, and that's the thing about so does your client. Yeah. Yeah. think that he's so right about that. Like, people want to see a solution.
01:13:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like, oh, I can, can absorb that.
01:13:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That makes sense.
01:13:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. They want to know that there's not just a point A and a point D, but they want to see that there are steps in between, which was something I did innately, but I didn't map it out. So what I would say is, hey, tell me where you want to go and let's work backwards. It was the same concept in my mind, but I never showed that. to anybody and seeing it, I was like, holy , they need to see it.
01:14:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, your B, your proverbial B is, hey, I'm not working this much. I'm not working this hard. I'm making more money. All the, all the things I don't like are gone and the things that I do like are still here. And you're like, yeah, your A is where you are right now. I can get you to B, and you know how you do that? It's these steps. And they go, oh, and it's true, right? If you, you know that those nine steps, and they don't necessarily go in order, right? Because they could come in on whatever, but that pathway or the learning those nine things, whatever the hell it's, you know, displayed to them will get them to be. Like, your people are all looking for the same B. I want, like, Mark. Mark's a good example. I'm sure Fuji's a good example. So, yeah, totally. And Mark's, I love how Mark on the phone the other day is like, what are we doing? I was like, I'm not, Sure, what we're doing, but we're going to do this math here, buddy. Can do that.
01:15:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, yeah, and we had an extra column. going to that's the one that I accidentally sent the notes. The whoopsie, which all got smoothed out because really the AI.
01:15:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm like, how, how is that what your summary is? That was not. Oh, sometimes they're horrible.
01:15:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So anyway, but all right. Well, we, I just totally used up your time.
01:15:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So sorry about that.
01:15:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
actually knowing you that if it came out that Lisa finally got something and she gets talked into getting help from somebody that can, you know, actually run with her extract things from her. Um, I, I adored her. I think she's amazing. She is incredible. And this process would be, I think the biggest issue for her would be figuring out the market.
01:17:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Think about your day. If you think of one, write it down. then when you get home, take that post and know that you thought of and put it wherever the hell it belongs.
01:17:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm sure you can start with nine.
01:17:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It just ends up being late.
01:17:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So no, I had like four or five. That was the original. And then I realized that there's, um, there's the next level stuff. So like the sharpen your saw and like mind your heart, those two last ones. They are like, how do you feed the visionary? How do you keep that person, um, up with everything, sharpening your shawl, whatever you're the best at, you have to keep doing it. You do it normally and naturally, but basically it's the shield against apathy and complacency. And then the mind's your heart or yeah, mind's your heart. So that's about heart and mind. It's that we're human beings. Um, and if you don't constantly feed yourself with positive information that strengthens you, that encourages you. urges you that uplifts you when it's a fan because it will, when you lose a spouse, when you lose a child, when you lose some function in your body, when you lose a parent, whatever, whatever happens when we go through a recession, something's going to happen to you. If you haven't intentionally been fortifying yourself on a daily basis, on a steady basis, when that comes, it's going to crush you. So that's something that is a part of my process, right? We do it in our coaching sessions and things like that. But it's not, you know, technically the business stuff, but it 100% is a strategy. It's an intentional strategy. It's a regular part of my practice. And so it got added into it. And yeah, anyway, so that's how it came about. So with Visa, I would just say, what are the things you always teach people? And I would show her how to use chat TBT and a Google Doc, and just go like, what are the things like, tell me some of the stories? Well, in those stories, we're going to extract a concept and she could start by telling chat GPT stories and then go okay what is the premise what is the concept that I taught and I could teach her how to do those things and then now she's got something that she can be working with if it's three o'clock in the morning and she can't sleep and she's like these things are on her mind but you don't want to go call somebody because everybody else is sleeping because they're saying they're not really um you know what I mean so that could be I could teach her those things because that's what I've been doing with this is using chat GPT telling it stories and then having it give me some like extraction like what did you notice I'm like oh yeah that's what I do and then I go write something what yeah yeah so anyway okay so sorry that was just there no even clear ending point I've got lots of questions for you and I've already taken a letter of time so I'll wait till next week but also thank you for being
01:20:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
the exceptional Dan that you are because um well I can pay you a dollar to put you under oath like where you can't see me but I can trust that so anyway you for being that awesome I appreciate you before I go though is there anything that's like I don't know something crazy that happened this week or something problematic so I can we can either talk about it or putting notes down so I can ask about it next week no I am just waiting for the supervised guys though they came back with like they can do the code when they came back they quoted doing the authorized dot man so they're up to like 20 grams it's like 20 grams to do all the customizations whatever and now and they're like do you want to make an offer for the copy the software do you want us to I'm like you can which they wouldn't do before so I'm like okay another willing to do it. And so I'm waiting for them to come back with that. So it'll be like 20 grand plus that. And then weirdly, the universe, I got Noria working on his or the employee or whatever, or high level. So I'm him and I'm sort of teaching him that like he asked questions like, Oh no, do do this. Look at this. This is how this works. And then in I look, I found something yesterday by accident is high level just randomly releases . Like there's no way you can keep up with it. And they're releasing something next week called third party integrations that I read today. And I was like, this is exactly what we need, I think. But I never thought about it. I had, I just thought they're never gonna do that. They're doing it. So I had this function that I wanted to put into follower flow. And Like, oh my god, we're going to be able to do that in a week. So I said it tomorrow, I go, hey, look at this. And I think this is where we need to go. I'm pretty sure he's going to come back and say yes. So yeah, that's like, wait. I'm waiting on you. I want to see what those guys come back with.
01:22:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's awesome. Oh, I'm Marsha stuff. Just quick update.
01:22:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm now delving into the custom JavaScript. So I haven't heard back from Melissa. I'm to hit up Melissa. She's going to it. I want to see where she's at. I've decided that I'm just going to rather than take a Tilla's container, I'm going to build a brand new one because Marsha, I didn't realize that they had all these pre-made templates for GTM, and he uses a bunch of them that we would use, like, Clarify or Clarity. He's like, oh, we use the Clarity template. We use this template, and then they have a template. So I think I'm. better off just and and the one that Attila built for ninja is custom. It has like a domain look up table. So we have like a master container that works for four sites. And it's cool. But I'm like, yeah, I don't think we'd ever do that again. So I need to build like one that's single domains ready. So yeah, I'm like, I'm gonna go I'm gonna finish this thing and then build my first container, which actually uses his starting container. then I append that with some other stuff. And then I'll push it onto woofer. Oh, and those guys met with Frank yesterday. I'm going out to lunch with Derek to get the Frank update. I decided when Eric was like, oh, we're just talking about getting stuff, the meetings at 6 a.m. You can be there or not. was like, or not, sounds good. I'll be in the or not column. That's funny.
01:23:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So wait, Frank was meeting with woofer?
01:23:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no, no, with Abhishek,
01:24:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, you switched here so fast. I did. Why had you?
01:24:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Well, that was the third thing.
01:24:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was like, that's the only other thing to, that I'm working on the things that are lurking earlier.
01:24:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right.
01:24:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So when do, when does Frank think Wolf be done? Wait, Wolf was already.
01:24:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know. Yeah. So they updated him on that. So he was back on his vacation and then they did all the get stuff and then recovering that with him and then I decided not to go up, show up to the meeting and sleep for another hour. So I'm going to take Eric out to lunch and just text it on, have you eaten and I'll get the update from Eric today.
01:24:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. Okay. So here's what I'll say. If you, I don't have to have the number that I said, that was the one that will give me like six months. Don't worry about it. So, because I've got Mark and I've got Guji, and I've got you, and I've got one other client, and that's it right now. There's a couple of me, but I really don't want them, and I really want to be able to stay focused on this. So if there's anything that you end up thinking of, okay, I'd be willing to invest this for that kind of thing, and it'd be a long-term turnaround, pretty much everything helps me not stress out about it right now. And then the whole Lisa thing would just be, it's just whatever, whether I get something out of it or not, I told her, would just do it for her if I got nothing out of it, because I want to see her do it.
01:25:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think the problem is she doesn't, not that she doesn't want to do it, it's that she doesn't think it's possible, I guess. I haven't talked or I'll hit her up. She's supposed to call me an item, call her back, oops.
01:25:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll text her, be like, well, yeah, I'll probably talk to her So the other thing is, ask her what she's What is the it? So when people are not specific, that's that's what makes it harder to believe it's possible. What does it look like? And exercise in the nevetsal. So for me, it was x amount of money, x amount of time. I'm happy not working with . That was it. That was it. So now that I knew what it wasn't, I'm not working with . I'm not working more than 20 hours a week. I'm not making less than x. Those put the parameters in place. So then it's like, what do I have to offer? Who will say yes to it? What's the math, right? How many people? And like, so what's the math of the number? How many people? What's the minimum amount of people I can have to get to that number? If I offer x, can I deliver x at a no-brainer price? Well, they'll be happy that they for sure see enough value in it that they'll pay that price. it's really simple math, but you have to answer some questions first and specifics, and I always start with, what do you not want? I don't want to make less than X. I don't want to work more than X. I don't want to work more than this time, and I don't want to deal with these kind of people. That creates the first container. That creates the first part of the mass. anyway, if you have enough of that conversation with her that she thinks that there's some positive, because the thing that I don't do is wrestle with people. You don't either. It's your sister, so it's different. You should wrestle with her a little bit and help her have some confidence in it, because we get to a point where jobs just don't make any sense. Age-wise, life-wise, it's just not worth it. But I don't know if you know anybody else who can figure out how to get everything I want within those parameters, and I did it. The only exception was the pandemic. Being with somebody who's dealing with this with the FTC and wanting to take care of three additional families. is at all costs, which is not normal.
01:28:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Most people don't have those things going on. Yeah, the only other person that knows me. Right. And how many people did you know? It was, I don't want to work for anyone else, initially. And then it became, oh, I need to make five grand a month. And then it became, oh, I want to do this. But it was always about, I don't want to work for anybody. So yeah, I don't know what her is. I don't think she knows. So it's a very good point. So it's like her it slash you're not like somewhere. If you define these two things, then you can and she, you know, sort of the perfect day concept, which is, I think the problem is just that her paradigm, she has this, she has this NPC, right? Sort of a paradigm of like, oh, you go, you get a job, you have a career. it's like, yes. Yeah. That is up.
01:28:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the institutional thinking. Yep. And that's what I told I her when I talked to her is that and that's why school is so difficult because your program to be an institutional person to go get a job in an institution where you continue to be programmed as an institutional person, which is you are there to serve, not to be served.
01:29:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:29:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, so if she was be willing to talk to me one week, once a week or a month, just come spend time with me, I will extract things out of her. I guarantee you that she will have a paradigm shift unless she refuses to do it.
01:29:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right, which is the current methodology.
01:29:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Yeah. But if after that much, she still refuses to do it, then you know what you know, and that is that until the pain of staying the same is worse than the pain of change, wait, pain of change is yeah, that's what I
01:30:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
in it.
01:30:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then she won't change, but at least we'll have resources when she is ready. Okay. Anyway, okay, I'll be quiet.
01:30:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Thank you. Have a good day.

I gotta remember that. I love that name so much. Do you remember when I was a kid? This was a navy blue phone and it was called Merlin and it was like they were Simon, you know, you pressed the button.
00:01:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And Marlin was kind of like that, but I don't know I just love everything Celtic Merlin, you know, the whole things But he looks like a wizard because he's all black and white, you know, he's oh, just like it looks like a little wizard a Merlin There he is coming again Hey, there he is he is Hi Marlin Hey Marlin, that's a cute boy. I used to do a boy He's gonna sleep well tonight.
00:01:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, the thing just I'm almost there Let's see, I'm just closing a bunch of Causing one step Project management methodology recap meeting includes including need to create agendas for the future Focus on securing a few high-level clients. Yeah, but what was the task? Action items review the camera Yeah, you suck at this.
00:02:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I suck at this?
00:02:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, not you. Never say that. No, Father, I'm sorry.
00:02:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, well, I do suck at project management. Ironically, when I'm with the business office for engineering, it's helping for price of our house. is ironic.
00:02:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know what?
00:02:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What is that?
00:02:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When you excel well enough in your own sphere, it compensates for not doing well in others. And that's why we don't have to be great at everything. Yeah, it didn't do a good job. And it didn't say what the agenda was.
00:02:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
just said that we needed to create an agenda. Oh, that's what I was like.
00:02:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like, yeah, that is not useful at all. Thank you for telling me that's an obvious, but I already knew. So, let me see how I got. Yeah, I. What I was thinking, so I was thinking about next steps, and I don't thank you for your uselessness by the time I will go open my own notes and do this. Let me get into the right. What'd you call it? And actually, I'm waiting to hear back for my client because I wanted to reschedule half an hour later, because I thought was not gonna want to go to school until lunch, but I think the massive mommy massages and a little ibuprofen and a home baked wiener wrap helped her be able to push through.
00:03:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So what was I doing?
00:03:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is my brain. Yeah, I'm going to go back and forth between crying. And I'm so sad. I've lost 20 pounds since April, by the way.
00:03:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, because you're really in.
00:03:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, that's why I tons of muscle on. I have done lots of healers. been hypoglycemic. had just taken. diabetes, I knew that this was going to be a battle, but yeah, so I'm upset, but I ordered a continuous glucose monitor and I fix it. But in the meantime, good, good. One more thing I have to think about constantly. Yeah, because it's not just like, Hey, it's high blood sugar. Hey, you could get neuropathy. Hey, I already have to use and I kind of need kidneys and I don't enjoy suffering and I already actually have chronic pain and suffer every single day.
00:04:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
like, I really don't want more of it. Hmm. Well, I know that my best friend, Derby kind of got diagnosed with that too. He's on the glucose monitor and it surprised me because he's like, yeah, he's not not that overweight at all. And but he's having success now. So anyways, I know you don't want to talk about it. But I'm just saying it seems to be prevalent. I'm on the verge.
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like I'm on the you know the markers that say hey you're close to it so you got to watch what you do but that's where I was and in April I was like okay I've lost 20 pounds I expected the number go down it went up so but the good news is like I know what to do and I'm not doing all of it but that's the thing is that you have to be vigilant at all times you have to either decide like do I want to be super disciplined or do I want to allow the things to happen that will happen and it's a choice like I don't get to choose do I have diabetes and do I deal with it but so and with the propensity towards hypoglycemia I feel like crap if my sugar is low I feel like crap if it's high and going low so it doesn't even have to be low and I think a lot of people don't take that into account and understand that the impact on mood and productivity when your brain is your job as a mom, as a business, whatever, when mood has such a big impact on it, like they're like, we just eat better. Yeah, it's not at easy.
00:06:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's yeah.
00:06:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I don't eat terrible. That's the thing.
00:06:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't even even working out as well. So yeah, yeah.
00:06:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but it's just when my God has a plan for me, he needs me to know what I'm capable of. And he needs me to make decisions. And also the one thing I need to know for sure is he needs me to lead by example. And instead of telling people what they should do, I get to be a walking testimony of this is what happens when you do the hard things. So now it's hard to be in an example though. Okay, let me share my screen because that'll haunt me stay focused. Is that the right one? It's not the right one. This is the right one. Dan and my attorney client are just like blowing up email right now. Don't know how to, oh actually, want to, that would stop notifications. don't know how to put my iMac in advanced strum. If I put my phone in do not disturb, it should put my computer. Okay, how many, oh look at my conversion thing. So let's do Trello first of all. And just work on our board there and get that in my way. So I'm going to create a new board. Let's see how workspace settings board creates. And we will call this. So, Good to do. What's called a business launch and scale template board. Okay. this can be like the one board to rule them all sort of thing. And Do that and see what their templates are. I have a job board. I don't know what that is. Go to markets. You know what I don't want to start with the template. I will just create it. Whoa. Well, that's kind of cool. guess I can deal with that. Little dark. I'll deal with what it looks like later. So let's create a 30,000 foot view list and the card is map out master plan. So this is, what does the entire business look like when it's reached full maturation? Okay, I'll grown up. Yeah, that's part of my intake process. I've been using for a long time because sometimes the language, you know, people struggle. with it. So when it's, when it's become the fullest version of your vision, vision, what does it look like? Um, most people think in terms of revenue only making 20 a year, but we get there. Really need to back down. Do this template to be, of course, all of itself. Yeah, if we, if we do it right. So what are you selling? That's the offer stack. How. How. How. How. is it fulfilled, supported, so filled at map out the entire process and ideal stack, including vendors and suppliers and softwares. So if it's digital, right, where's it? Where's it housed? Where is it housed? Yeah. What is the customer experience during that process? Support in, who supports the products, services, and how many people. I'm sorry. does, employees, powers, works, ideal, wages, go level, what level of autonomy leadership they have. So again, we're talking about what is it look like when it's all grown up. Now this is way too much for most people, but this is, but if we're thinking about it in terms of reverse engineering, because even if they're not coming to the table telling you what their big dream and vision is, they have one. And we talk about a lot of times entering the conversation in people's heads. And the other thing is where frustration happens, where offense happens, where disappointment happens, is when expectations are Met and whether they communicated or not and even whether they are conscious of it or not The expectation is that whatever I'm doing right now is leading me to this actual drain and vision. I have in my head The burden then is to make that happen even if they haven't communicated it They're holding accountable whatever they're doing right now to this and most people they're not even conscious that they're doing it They don't know a lot of times people don't ask for help because they don't know how to ask for help They don't know what to ask for help with because they're going like yeah, but I need this I need this I need this Like I can't ask for all these things. can't afford all this help I don't even know how to get from here to there. So That is the thing that most people need is they don't know how to get from here to there. You could tell me any situation that you're trying to do. And I could probably figure out a practical plan to get you from here to there. We can vicariously guide them through getting from here to there by walking them through the mental process this. I almost guarantee you not nobody but most of the people have never gotten this specific in what their big vision is. And most of them even with the specific questions won't be able to tell you what that looks like. But if they can get a version, and this is what we'll say at the bottom if you if you can get a version how what now this doesn't mean that you're going to build what you plan out here. But if you can't even build a specific version in your mind of what you're going for you're having an Alice in Cheshire cat conversation. What path do I take? Where are you going? Don't know. Then the path doesn't matter.
00:15:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:15:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we could throw in an image like that, too. Let's see if I get the image. So because we have limited time, this is, this helps kind of just give an example. Let me see if I can add an image or maybe I could just drag it in. Let me just complete that particular step in my head. It's not a desktop. There it is. All right. right. Yeah, so what I would like to do, however long it takes, is spend some time, a lot of it I can do myself, and then I could show you, and then on calls we can kind of work through it and go, I'll go like, well, here's what I've come up with. And then discuss it, and as we discussed it, I would imagine because this is what happens is I'll either get inspired to make modifications or you'll have some modifications that you'll suggest. But at the end of the conversation, however long that takes, we will have a template that a person can pick and choose and say, okay, I want this board I don't need this board. This is not applicable, right, but they'll have the master thing. So instead of going and adding boards, they can just remove, remove, remove, being able to visualize the whole thing can help. And so it in and of itself could be its own product and service. The other thing is, though, if we get a high level client, then we go through and say, okay, these are the boards that are applicable. now we just create. eight assignments, like, who's going to do this? When is this going to get done? Who's going to do this? When is it going to done? There will be dependencies that are built into the template. For example, if you're building a sales page, first of all, you have to have a domain. You have to have hosting. You have to have the, you have to have a merchant processing. You have to have, maybe you have to have a gateway if you have a merchant account, know, like all of these things. But then you have to have copy. You have to have images. The images need to be inspired by the copy. So the copy has to come first. So there's a dependency, right? The copywriter has to know what the name of the product is and has to have some information on them. So the copy is dependent upon market research and definition. So all of that stuff can be created in a, not necessarily linear, but somewhat chronological process and for people. I've never done this or never done it well. Most of the people that have done it did not do it well, did not do it quickly. It'll be the first time they've seen it mapped out like that. Even on a high level, because a lot of the high level, and I'm talking about seven and even eight bigger earners, I think it's very different once you get to nine and above. They didn't get there by not systematizing, optimizing, even if they're not good at higher somebody who is good at it. They understand the process because somebody else was helping them in doing it. They did it themselves. But seven and eight figure earners, a lot of the times just got there by grit, determination, charisma, that type of thing. Lots of times. It's not through good business structure, organization, and optimization. Anyway, I would like to do this. So what I was talking about is for us to create an agenda. And the agenda can be we progress on it even if we can't meet because stuff is going happen. Yeah, we can't meet but then we still know what we're working on. So to me and I'm going to go ahead and save this for now and pop over to this one, questions for next meeting, I'm going to say agenda, meeting agendas. I'm going add a card so big rocks call it big rocks so big rocks are not that open card. Really the big rocks so I'm kind of prioritizing them. So the big rock is one, two, four, five, on the through three not two three one two three anyway one three um high level df done for you um clients or done with you either i'll say df y slash the clients um that we work on together in either well in some marketing plus project management capacity in order to fund everything else and keep our saws so we'll put this here then the other thing would be so i see the next level down would be hybrid coaching group. Yeah, I'm not gonna call it group where we get to serve mid to get, I'll say mid level. Because this helps us ascend our audience. The higher level helps us refine our teaching serves as energy for us because we're in the community of people who are doing things and have experience, but don't need a ton for us. Yes, we end. they are doing things that we don't. have a high level of commitments to them. Also funds, whatever we are building.
00:22:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
To me, this gets the most time.
00:22:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And this is the, remember I told you, there's 10% of people that will succeed no matter what you do, 10% that will fail no matter what you do, and there's 80% in the middle. To me, this is the 50 to 80% people. 50% people that are most are 90% actually, who's 60 to 90%. Most influenceable. Most kind of. Yeah, most influenceable. So, it gives us. this greater opportunity to impact the market on a larger scale, also should inspire content creation. So the high level of people in that top, they're in the top 10%. Their content, the only content they really need is going to be bite sized nuggets for the most part, something to inspire them because the rest of it is they're going to need a book, a masterclass or like a tactile thing that is too high level for most people, it needs to be really specific.
00:23:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah.
00:23:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Whereas this group of people, they, there's a lot that they need to learn. So this is basically school, like they need to go to school every day, they need to learn the basics and the fundamentals. Um, maybe they have one fundamental mastered, but for the most part, they probably have zero fundamentals mastered and so they, they need the constant fountain, but they also need somebody that they can ask questions to from time to time. Um, but because of that, interacting with them should help us to know, hey, if we go go make a YouTube video on this or do a podcast on this or whatever create content around this, it should have a pretty large audience that can attract more people into this group and the goal would be to ascend, either continue to be there as a support, right, and we can ascend them maybe into a higher level group where there's even less, but they, um, members, but they get maybe a little bit more touch or maybe that it's box or access or whatever. I don't know. But anyway, that's where I'm thinking is that this, this takes up the most of our I'm in energy and I don't mean it in excess, I just mean that that's, that's the greatest need group. And then the other one would be do it yourself, coaching, they get software well, not software. They get courses, courses, emails, videos, curated content, but not Ascent, then higher level, low ticket, but low vibration also. That's, that's, that's, what it's going to be for the most part. There will be high vibration people in there that are going to move up. for the most part, we don't want to spend a lot of time and energy here. This is just we're offering it. It's a magnet to attract people. If you're looking for something and you can't afford more, this is here for you. But if you're the kind of person that is going to multiply what you have, that's when we want to work with you. But first, you have to prove it by consuming what we've given you and taking action on it. So this is our kind of, it's give back, it's taking advantage of giving use of our library, of wisdom, knowledge, products we've created. So they are just creating these are the big rocks. So, big rocks are everything that we do throughout the week. If it isn't serving a big rock, either we need to redefine our rocks or it shouldn't be getting done. Unless, you know, we're getting into, I'm acknowledging the fact that I'm just doing this because it's shiny and it's fun and I want to, but I'm not doing it at the detriment of these other things. So, one of the things we have to do is do we want to agree that these are the priorities of what we want to work on together.
00:27:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think so. I have to think about this more to see if there's something to And writing it down helps us to do that.
00:27:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you can look at that. So then the next thing would be so in order to support the big rock. So the first big rock is this. And so, in order to do that, we need to create Trello board template. And we'll do this. Right out. Already. Slash pedigree. Post page. That's what I was looking for. Products. Already created. And define which ones need to be updated. Okay. All The sub task is create tasks and due dates, assignments, can we repurpose it, can somebody else do this, can we delegate it or not, for updating those products. And then, um, that creates a webinar or VSL or VSL or video, either way, however we do it, um, Our history, um, how we grow businesses and how. The power. of, you know, your marketing specifically, and my project management and ops is a powerhouse catalyst for sustainable growth. Something to that effect. So we've been talking about, that's what people need to see, right? They need to see who we are, what we do, how we can do it, we put it in some content where, because first we have to increase their level of awareness, just that we're even there. We need to have a application form, qualification form in order to talk to us, paid time that is given rebate, basically, on towards working with us. So to me, that's it for this big rock, because we have clients at some point, right? So potentially create maybe YouTube ads for getting eyeballs on this content, slash offer, whatever. I mean, but that's, it wants to this. But to me, that is the overarching kind of view of like, what we've discussed should happen. And that if we do this, and if we do these things well, it should attract the people that we're looking for.
00:31:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
we don't. I agree. Yeah, yeah. it eliminates all the time on the sales calls, pre-selling, right? Because a lot of them are, you know, haven't been, yeah, exposed to our content, so you don't have to answer it one-on-one, you know? Yeah, I like that.
00:32:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll do this. Everything that we do for my level clients helps us here. That content can be repurposed to be to this offer. The solo board becomes, we template, we sell rather than use for that, right? So we're creating it, and we'll use it for our content. at high level, but for the hybrid and the low level people even, you get it, you manage it, you do it, but we created it.
00:33:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If my power goes out, that's why I lost you. We just thunderstorms coming in.
00:33:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, both the dog and cat's heads went up and look it around. It's funny, but not, you know.
00:33:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we get it right when you're not a huge city. these storms cause power.
00:33:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and we used to live out in the country where the power went out part of it, and it's only 15 minutes away from here, but the city grid and county grids are different and the upkeep on them and the quality of them. My girls are now because because we used to live out there and we'd have outages for like 12 hours. so we're like, I wish the power would just go out. only way it happens here is not usually from a storm unless we need a train call or if a car ran into a transformer. So that does happen, but because We are dead in the middle of the city and the impact is so huge they get the crews out immediately Okay But it also does never take down the cell towers, and I've got Wi-Fi like they'll service for days, so Okay, um anyway, so What I think that we could do and this is something like I could work on and then just go okay I finished it. Do you want to add anything to it? don't actually have to do this on the calls? I'll sometimes like and This is what I was talking about when you're like maybe it could be a support call Sometimes my brain is just like I can't draw the energy like I need the conversation Then just being here talking about it together my brain goes. Oh, yeah, let's see this this isn't this But I cannot get myself to sit down and even open this and look at it It feels Overwhelming and I feel sad and I feel impressed And it's just the way my brain works and it stresses me out and frustrates me, but if I talk to somebody about it And I'm like, Oh, I love this again. Let's do this. And it's a social thing. So, um, I don't. So, so to me, like, for, for here, through next week. And so you close the one client, right? have income coming for, yeah. to me, that's bought some time you've got enough. Yeah. So, so what I would love to do is just kind of set, first of all, the, so the first thing has to be, let's agree on what our rocks are. And, um, generally speaking, I'd like to set rocks for the quarter, but sometimes they'll extend past. Sometimes they don't take up the whole quarter. But to me, these things, building these out through the rest of the end of the year, like, if we go fast, amazing. But if we don't, and it takes us until like, you know, it would be really great if we have an offer ready. for the new year energy. Yes, people are setting goals and targets. I'm not a huge, like, I'm on a constant path of evolution. I don't need something to tell me I need to redefine myself and change myself. And but that's big energy for for a new year. People like have a sudden awareness of where they're at.
00:36:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Whereas I'm constantly taking stock of it.
00:36:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I've never really been big into that. But the more that I realize like there really is a surge. And I do have seasonal energy shifts and awareness. So something happens. Like when everything gets cold and dies, like my perspective shifts when fall happens and the kids go back to school after I'm done just because in the summer, all I want to do is set up the sun.
00:36:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't really care about anything else at all.
00:36:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to be in the water. I want to be outside. I just want to be cleaning and organizing, so I have natural seasons that are very different operationally and mentally, but I have noticed that there is generally this whole surge of people evaluating themselves and feeling a pressure and a depression and a sadness and an overwhelm during the holidays probably increased also by the fact that they might not have the family that they want to have. Christmas Day is the biggest day of suicide. At least in America, I don't know how it is worldwide, but given that Christianity isn't as prevalent throughout the whole world. But that's it. So anyway, if we could have working backwards, since you um, I don't know. So And next week I would love us to figure out some targets of what could we have and do we do we go do we target more the the high ticket and let the high ticket work trickle down and to feed this this lower level. I'd love to come up with names for each of these. And so it's like this one could be pocket COO, CMO, right? It would be great if we and this could be just what do we have it right now? Marketing Accelerator, I have a new school group.
00:38:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, this is yeah, perfect.
00:38:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's perfect because that's my hair is driving me now.
00:38:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:38:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so if we could figure out what is marvellous. I'm like, oh, yeah, the purple.
00:39:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let's see the purple. Oh, yeah.
00:39:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's pretty.
00:39:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
love it. Go ahead. Sorry.
00:39:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, you've got the colorful picture behind you and then you've got the red shirt and the purple and I'm just like, it just goes.
00:39:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's awesome. I know. Well, the funniest thing is I did no videos today. So we're just wearing a t-shirt here and no makeup and hair was in like up and ahead, Ben.
00:39:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look at you.
00:39:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Look at you. Yeah, yeah. So, um, yeah, well, right now the business accelerator, honestly, is 99% the gears. So I don't think there's that many mid-level people in it. I don't think we should think about what's there. I think we should think about what we want to be there. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because we could, yeah, so it could become something else. mean, I'm a little bit of a fan right now, just someone I'm seeing and then how we could potentially attract a lot of good traffic from YouTube, especially when we start, you know, really, you know, everything else we got going on here with the pedigree and, and, and, hold it on the messaging. I think, yeah, to like a webinar VSL funnel to sell like a 197 or 297, I think could be the coolest thing as the middle one.
00:40:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That hybrid coaching group, maybe and 197.
00:40:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
My eyes just really well was opened when Cara showed me that productivity funnel that is charging $297 for course, make $100k a month. Like, wow, that's nice.
00:40:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and I think though, so here's the thing about pricing. When you can show a person the value and how they're 297 at the very least, they make it back. If not, they make more. So that requires is then to already be making money. We don't want to have people going broke in here. If you are not able to get your money back, if you're not making money and we can't help you get your money back, we don't want the energy of your stress and your overwhelm. Anyway, go to our go get our other stuff.
00:41:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, and that's sort of where I'm thinking a $197 to $97 is because the $5 of the free and then now I change the $5 a month school group, I don't think the energy's right in there.
00:41:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like don't have a joy doing my Wednesday calls, but speaking of that, either fall in a minute, I got a call in a minute as well.
00:41:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. So actually right now it's just in three. Oh, you want to play your time? So but I like where this is going, um, marvelous.
00:41:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, marvelous. So we can keep working on this. We'll carry the conversation through officer. You go ahead. I feel like this was productive.
00:41:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think you're amazing. I adore you. Thank you.
00:41:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cheers. Bye. Bye.

Are you guys here together? Can you hear me? Hello?
00:00:56 - mark sweet
You Hey.
00:01:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi, I can hear you guys. I'll hear you. Do I have both of you?
00:01:06 - mark sweet
No, I'm going to do a round then. Hold on, absolutely my mouth.
00:01:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going see you too. I'm going brush my teeth and I feel like I missed something and it's driving me nuts. I'm tired. Hey.
00:01:42 - mark sweet
Is this a home office or office office? No, it's not. The office is the one usually see it with the window where you can see the airplanes.
00:01:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, we're hardly ever on video, so I don't know. Now we've got Chona. Oh, no audio yet. Water. Oh, there. Something. Hi. I am so excited to meet you in person. Well, Zoom person, you know, this person. You're so pretty. I mean, I mean, you're gorgeous.
00:02:26 - Chona Sweet
Oh, thank you. It's probably a good idea.
00:02:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've got like three tablets, three laptops, one desktop, you know.
00:02:43 - Chona Sweet
Oh, I was drinking a crap.
00:02:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I thought that the this would be the fastest way to kind of figure out what, because you've talked about what Chona's doing a little bit Mark and like how there's some income potential there and then Chona you're just getting your head wrapped around showing up being the schedule and then also Mark has a different kind of brain those those business brain people it can be a lot so it's a good thing it's just not you know like trying to get on the same page with everybody we all think differently and very intensely so mark if you would pretend I don't know anything about anything and give me just the real like third-grade version of what you see the potential is then we can start the conversation from there yeah so there's
00:04:00 - mark sweet
three income streams.
00:04:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:04:04 - mark sweet
The first one is what I would consider traditional medical practice.
00:04:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:04:10 - mark sweet
So the doctor, his name is Dr. E, just so we're all kind of on the same page. Okay. Dr. E's primary practice is traditional healthcare pain management.
00:04:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you.
00:04:24 - mark sweet
So he is the pain management provider of multiple facilities and clinics. what I mean by facilities is hospitals, including health insurance. So he primarily bills health insurance, gets reimbursed from health insurance, and that's where he's paying employees from.
00:04:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:04:48 - mark sweet
That'll make sense.
00:04:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sort of. is my problem with trying to take notes and listen at the same time.
00:04:54 - mark sweet
So I'm just going to listen and let the AI note taker do its job. So most people who are professional, being doctors or nurse practitioners, those are the people seeing the patients, get paid on a per visit payment.
00:05:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:05:09 - mark sweet
So you get paid X amount per person that you visit, more people you see, more money you make.
00:05:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:05:18 - mark sweet
So that is in the hospital, some of it's in clinic settings, some of that is telehealth follow-ups.
00:05:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:05:25 - mark sweet
Yep. Now I'm ready to get paid the same across the board, no matter what that is. Okay. So when you generally want to go to places, we're going to see more patients, because if you're driving around and only seeing two patients at each place, you're kind of losing time on money. So let's say one facility, a 17 new people to see and one has two. Right. advertise a 17. So that's the main traditional practice. Okay. Second part is the personal injury practice. Okay. So that's most similar to what Fuji does, from kind of what you know, the difference is Dr. E. he doesn't just do consultations. He does procedures and surgery.
00:06:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:06:07 - mark sweet
So he works with a wide variety of lawyers and other doctors. So we're used to seeing maybe 10 or 15 lawyers that food you might work with, Dr. D for hours 50 of them. Some good, some bad, some in the middle. Okay. And so part of running Chona on is the medical records for a traditional practice versus PI practice. Well, they necessarily shouldn't be this way are different. Okay. Here's what I mean by that. Good enough is good enough a lot of the time for traditional practice. So we're noticing and seeing a lot of dictation service from Dr. D, where it's just dragon dictation and writing the notes. Okay. But there's a lot of typos and misspellings and some other things because it's not perfect. Which the general gist is there. Okay. In personal injury, that causes problems when you get into litigation or further on, because it looks like you're doing what you need to do. And so bringing on Chona is a couple of things. One, being able to see more personal injury patients. Two, having someone who actually can write records and reports that make sense, which is part of what I've been working with her on. There's lot of things that would get complicated and we can jump into those later. Very, very simple right now.
00:07:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, thank you.
00:07:31 - mark sweet
Now Chona can do some basic procedures as an NP, like trigger points and couple of good things.
00:07:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But... Hi, sorry, my daughter's leaving for the night.
00:07:46 - mark sweet
But she can't do things like surgery. She can assist, but she can't do the surgery itself, because she's not the doctor. So the payment structure is a little bit different in that now, legally speaking, she can only get paid for the person she sees. cannot get paid a percentage.
00:08:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, legally formal, yes.
00:08:05 - mark sweet
So we worked out a version of that that makes a lot of sense for her. And I'm assuming hypothetically speaking, hypothetically speaking, there might be a 50 50 split on consultations. So similar to like what Fuji does now where it's 400 500 visit. So split between Chona and Dr.
00:08:27 - Chona Sweet
E.
00:08:28 - mark sweet
And then 20% of whatever the procedure values are. Now procedure values tend to be much more significant, usually running anywhere between 4,000 up to 50,000 plus per procedure.
00:08:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And why would he be interested in sharing that? Because Chona would be the one who is in these patients and people that I know. And how are you getting around the legalities of that? are you creating some other kind of that kind of person, company, whatever.
00:09:03 - mark sweet
So it's a little C and thing. follow our taxes separately, like everything to keep separate.
00:09:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:09:11 - mark sweet
So I get no personal benefit out of doing this. I just get a happy wife.
00:09:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I get some personal benefit. That's not what I mean.
00:09:18 - mark sweet
Like, I think referrals, maybe, for example, Christian, honey, I think that's what people that I know. Because again, I know that Sean is going to do a good job. And, you know, a lot of issues are the same things like these pain doctors get really busy and don't do as good of a job.
00:09:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get that. That's helpful because it's a little more onto it. But when you said technically, she can only get paid per procedure and can't really get a referral fee. How are you structuring that?
00:09:50 - mark sweet
You know, there's a lot of marketing costs involved in what she does. And so more than sure, Dr. would be very happy to pay a marketing fee to help her continue to grow. I wrote for a pipeline.
00:10:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got it. Got it. Um, valid and creative. Well done. So, okay.
00:10:12 - mark sweet
Um, then there's number three because that's number two.
00:10:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you.
00:10:17 - mark sweet
It's okay. Um, and number two, number two or semison. Chona does not need doctor supervision in multiple other states. California is one of the few that she has to be under doctor supervision. So, you know, when you go to the doctor, usually see a PA or an NP, like most of the time. Um, in Washington state, she does not need to be supervised by a doctor. There are. What about Oregon? Sorry.
00:10:46 - Chona Sweet
about Oregon?
00:10:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think you need to an organ either.
00:10:50 - mark sweet
Anyway, sorry.
00:10:51 - Chona Sweet
Carry on.
00:10:52 - mark sweet
Um, but in Washington state, there's two doctors who have tried to use some of the telemed pain docs that we've worked with before. I'm just going to use footage of the exam. and they weren't thrilled with like some of the reports and just again when the pain dogs get really busy things then you get to sloppy. Yeah. And so because I'm I'm just literally friends with these people they'd be more than happy to send you know about 10 to 20 patients a week to try not just to do consults. She would not need to split any fee because she'd be off on her own without any doctors provision. That's what I like do procedures she can't do anything else obviously.
00:11:26 - Chona Sweet
I can do trigger points.
00:11:29 - mark sweet
You're not flying up to see how to do it right away. It doesn't make sense.
00:11:32 - Chona Sweet
Yeah.
00:11:34 - mark sweet
Because we'd have to find a surgery center or an office and it comes with its own liability and everything else.
00:11:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean but what if there's a good song skiing?
00:11:44 - mark sweet
You would have to find rent out medical spaces expensive.
00:11:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:11:49 - mark sweet
Jeez. Whatever.
00:11:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not saying that it couldn't happen in the future but for the short cut. No, no, no. I mean you know I'm joking obviously.
00:11:58 - Chona Sweet
But these are options. I mean again if she gets busy No, up there to go up there twice a week to go and do procedures that she can earn more for than.
00:12:04 - mark sweet
Yeah, it does make sense. The issue is trigger points only pay about 800 each, and she's going to about 450 for a console and trigger points take out as much if not more time.
00:12:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice click and do you and I know the answer to this, but I'm going to ask it anyway, have a spreadsheet with all of the income earning opportunities and that makes some basic calculations on what can happen. Then roughly how long each of those procedures or types of income opportunities take to fulfill so that you can figure out roughly what the earning potential is.
00:12:40 - mark sweet
In my head, because there's the same limitation that kind of Fuji has, she can really only see about 400 patients in a month, more than that you start paying for that.
00:12:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:12:51 - mark sweet
so, part of the benefit with being under the doctor in California is the doctor's going to be signing their reports and records so it allows her to have a little bit more flexibility and to make It's kind of like cheating, I guess, to be able to see more people, not really cheating, but...
00:13:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or you could see 400 people and try to get them to come back for other like follow-ups and whatnot.
00:13:12 - mark sweet
More procedures and things. problem on the legal side is this, because the limits are what they are, there are times where you just, even though they may need that procedure, there's not enough money to get that to actually happen.
00:13:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it's 400 in a month, right?
00:13:28 - Chona Sweet
It's not just 400 you've ever seen per person.
00:13:31 - mark sweet
Per month.
00:13:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Per month, okay. month, yes. So then, how have we covered all the income-earning things?
00:13:40 - mark sweet
I felt like we did. Those are the three for her. The only other one for me is essentially what we've talked about with Dan is building out a better software, a better way to do this. With Sime, I report writing that could get away with a lot of the issues that we're seeing like Dr. E and somebody's being Dr.
00:13:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Suffer from. I think that this Steph, me working with Chona is actually probably going to help expedite that. I'll see things that in a different way. So then Chona, let me get to know you a little bit. And now the one thing that I that stood out to me that I was that I'm kind of holding on to is that this is a fulfillment kind of thing like that you didn't really necessarily want before, but do which is like having something of your own, having purpose, not just work, you know, but like something that you're proud of, something that you that you do. But what else could you succinctly kind of summarize what was the catalyst for starting this, what were the things that were happening inside of you that made you say, I'm ready. I want to do that. is because you still obviously have some overwhelm and so not being sure about things, but obviously have enough faith and Mark and in yourself to want to proceed with this. kind of help me figure out like imagine and be there with you when you're like, okay, I am ready and I'm all in.
00:15:23 - Chona Sweet
What was that I think, I'm not sure if Mark mentioned JP, honey. That's so we recently completed more of a kind of individual coaching type service and we it basically helped me I think that'll put it me into myself that I didn't know is there or has always been there but I I just, it's just wake that, you know, passion up again from me. I feel like I've always been passionate and with my career and then life happens. I think I think after my dad passed in 2020, I lost that passion and then, you know, there's some psychological depression with that brief. And, you know, after that coaching, I just have this renewed passion, you know, within myself. And it's like perfect time, you know, when I say it's like just how it happens. Yeah, the coaching finish. And then would you say, mean, a few weeks before I finish, Mark has been talking to Dr. E. So, and then Dr. E again recommended or ask Mark, do you think Jonah would want to? I don't know if I know, you know, the background. I know Dr. E from my previous work. He's a fellow. He's a doctor in training way back in 20 I don't know, 17 2016 no 2014 2015 so he's fellow and I'm a nurse practitioner, but that's how we met with Dr. E at Theodore Sinai And then I introduced him to mark because he the moment he graduated he wanted to hire me That's one of the NPS that I'm not sure. don't want to work too hard And then I introduced him to mark and they clicked cuz they're both you know have that business mentality and Ever since he's been asking me and I said no no no no I don't do this I'm I have an employee mindset I don't think I have no clue anything about business or anything like that. And then finally, I think it's just that, you know, that timing with my personal coach and then Mark talking to him and I didn't even realize that I'll have a second or I have another job at this time. This is not part of the plan. What you mean another job? I mean not another job, I mean a different job, I mean leaving my previous job because this is a new job for me, so.
00:18:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. What were you doing before? Like were you?
00:18:38 - Chona Sweet
I'm still an I'm a nurse practitioner but more of an internist in a psych hospital.
00:18:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
00:18:46 - mark sweet
Wasn't the last what you're in, you're in a half?
00:18:49 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, the last year and a half, like I started part time with them in late 2022 while I was at UCI doing pain management and then I become time of last year of February. Then I've been doing that. Um, but prior to that, I've been doing pain management since 2013. Since I've become a nurse practitioner in 2013. I've been doing pain management. then I said, I don't want to do pain management anymore. I want something different, more challenging. And it definitely challenged me. biggest population is very challenging, but someone has to, you know, take care of those patients. Again, mental health is the taboo, still even on the medical fields, but in no one needs to help those patients. you know, it's definitely challenging. and then this opportunity arrived and then on the timing of the personal coaching, I said, you know what, not? Well, why can I see that person that can make more that I didn't even realize I can? Obviously, obviously with Mark, I guess. push gentle push like you can do this you believe in what i can do so that helps so what parts of it um excite you the most um the autonomy has always been there that's why i became an arch practitioner that's why i went back to you know getting my master's and doctors like i wanted to be a economist like that that's the driving factor and just in context i left UCI even though i'm paying good money i mean okay money i don't think i feel that they're paying me too much because they're not utilizing my full of potential and i don't like that that's why i left that job and that's why i went to the internist position which even though i'm very autonomous it's a very it's scary you know you have to always I'm back with this patient's mark is always kind of worried that I would come one time I came home with a scratch in my face like the patient do that just like no it's either you know it's a high stress environment but so you and money I mean if you're asking about that the income potential is there 100 percent I mean I'm gonna lie it's not if that's not it but it's more I think the autonomy and the fulfillment of utilizing to my fullest potential trumps the money because if it's really money that I'm talking about like UCI would have been perfect yeah I was just gonna say that doesn't make any sense that money would be even in the top because if you left because they're paying you too much and not using you then your perceived value is more important to you like I think so right Hans because remember how I would always complain that I feel like I'm um, what's that term used? I'm a glorified babysitter. babysitter.
00:22:09 - mark sweet
You're helping the residents at UCI because, you know, they're doing doctors and they don't know what they don't know. And while you enjoy teaching, it was just kind of a, you were there just to make sure they didn't screw up something.
00:22:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so money's definitely not your main driver.
00:22:26 - Chona Sweet
You, you want to serve a purpose.
00:22:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, you might like it, but if she made that decision, money can't be the main driver.
00:22:35 - Chona Sweet
It might be closed, but it can't it's definitely, there's that component of the incompotential of making what two doctors can make in a year. It's definitely there, you know, like I'm gonna lie. But if you tell me that I will be working as what I do at UCI and be a glorified assistant and not utilizing my potential, I will not be happy.
00:23:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Even if I make that much money. So I'm just gonna delineate the difference between making a lot of money and earning a lot of money. So earning a lot of money is important to you. Making a lot of money is not as much. Right. The difference is just it's slight but it's important. Mark, are you laughing about?
00:23:26 - mark sweet
I don't know, like it's nice things. I do.
00:23:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's okay. But it's still that it's not the same. When you tie how you get the money, that matters.
00:23:38 - Chona Sweet
Right. That's that's what I'm saying. That's right for me to even say I felt that I'm getting paid. I'm getting I'm paying they're overpaying yet you said because they're not doing what I'm supposed to do. I feel like that's a good feeling.
00:23:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean if your husband gives you all the things you you are that because you married him.
00:24:00 - mark sweet
So No, we're not.
00:24:02 - Chona Sweet
No, we're not.
00:24:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, we're to see you open this kind of words. Okay.
00:24:06 - mark sweet
Hey, she should make double what she's been making before. The other thing too is, when I tell Med Park, it's more and more robust. It does allow us more flexibility, but from a location standpoint, as well as, you know, a time standpoint. So if we want to travel or one of the other things for kids or whatever else, it gives us more options in terms of working time. And so it's not just a single income leader, know, anything else, trying to instill earn her income and what have you while being able from home or being able to work from wherever we are.
00:24:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:24:40 - Chona Sweet
So freedom. Yes, I like that.
00:24:43 - mark sweet
Yeah. So all these things kind of come together. And the timing was good.
00:24:46 - Chona Sweet
Dr. He's been trying to recruit her for years because he doesn't have to train her.
00:24:50 - mark sweet
And, you know, he's like, make, he's definitely more business focused, but it's kind of raining.
00:24:55 - Chona Sweet
He's all over the place. Oh my gosh. He is.
00:24:58 - mark sweet
Because he just takes on every project.
00:25:00 - Chona Sweet
which is okay but you know he needs people who can do what they need to do and so it's a great learning opportunity and she's going to have more opportunity than she would if she joined you know like any other paint tops that it would work like this procedure I've never done this before but doing procedures which I am very much this is what I'm saying like utilizing to my fullest potential although California we I still need it in collaboration with a physician but this is just the first time after 11 years of the nurse practitioner so first time I'm doing a procedure which is you know it's great it's amazing you like learning yeah yes I do I do and yeah all right so now I understand the why and the what a little bit and now we got to kind of figure out the how that works with chona so the thing and I was talking to you about this last week chona
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the mind is that the beginning is always the hardest, but what I can tell you and hopefully Mark can testify to is that when we really break it down and look at everything, what we're doing is we're going to be looking for leverage and optimization. So what that looks like is for example, you know, seeing more patients in one location, but there's going to be so many things that you're doing that from communication, travel, how certain locations operate, how you plan your day as well as how you start your day. Mark used to start it by checking his phone every first thing in the morning and get stressed out about something that went wrong or whatever, just immediately like it pumps cortisol into our bodies that that's stress of like there's something to do and I'm just like, can you just not look at your phone for a little bit and see how that goes and started working Dolce and there were some improvement. It's like the little things. It's not just the person doing business is the most important part of the business. So we'll talk about a lot of different things and it will start with a lot of questions. So the first step is you've got to get your head wrapped around everything and then you've got to be able to communicate to me enough so that I can get my around everything and so then we can start working together. So it is slow and kind of tedious and overwhelming in the beginning which is why I said you can also feel free to just vent send messages and just kind of vent because even in that venting I'll learn some things I'll learn about you know what's happening and the faster the more we communicate in the beginning the faster I'll be able to get to something useful for you. My standard It is I just talked to people once a week. Although I do tell them hey, you can reach out to me. Nobody does So it takes a long time.
00:28:06 - mark sweet
think you run in photo stuff.
00:28:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know I know thank you so much I love that doggy. I do take doggy payments Yeah, so You know something was just on your mind and you like this happened and I don't know where to put it I don't want to hold on to it You can tell anybody or you can tell me like I said you can just leave me like a voice You know you have an eye called to right Audio messengers are so great because then it does the dictation and I can just read it if I can't listen at the moment And so I will encourage you share as much as you feel like sharing Because the sooner I get all of that the faster will get there Um because I don't even know What questions to ask right now other than mark The fastest way is to get something that we can all look at so we can on same page, right, which is where, what are the offices, what are the opportunities, what are the procedures, what are the all the things. And it seems very tedious and Mark doesn't like tedious, but we can do another group call and I can extract it and I can create the spreadsheet myself. That's totally fine. But and that process actually works really well for me, Mark, because then I'm getting it firsthand and when I'm putting stuff in this spreadsheet, then I wrap my head around it. So what we could do is just schedule a couple more of these calls until I got my head wrapped around all of the opportunities to even start to formulate the questions. And you know how it goes and Mark can explain this to you is the more that we look at, the more we talk about the more that we see, the more the questions formulate, the more you just don't even know what you don't know. So it's a lot of asking questions and then it's just kind of a rough. It's not really fancy and it's not shiny and it's not exciting, but it gets some results and hopefully it'll help you be peaceful sooner rather than later.
00:30:14 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, I feel like everything is up in there. I'm getting used to the flow of the number one, the main traditional, that's what Ricky's He's going to put me because he's really all over the place. He's spread him to the food and he's about to take on a really large contract.
00:30:38 - mark sweet
He's not always going to fulfill it.
00:30:41 - Chona Sweet
So she puts her in Long Beach, which is probably busiest hospital, I would say. Sorry. like my mind no no I have to initiate a lot so like what I feel like I am he doesn't have any plan for me whatsoever I I told him is it okay with you you know being respectful I will shadow this NP you know because I want to know how they do it because the office manager which is Mark's Mary I don't know if you know her but the office manager would tell me don't do how doctor eat that because he does it may definitely you do it the right way so I have to shadow everyone else because I need to know the right way more efficient way so that's what I did yesterday he didn't tell me I have to tell him like I'm doing this is that okay with you sure that's why everything I said sure so I can see myself as my goal knowing what I'm where I am now is I wanted to make sure that the Long Beach Memorial, it will be, I will have, I want to have my roots basically there. Rather than running around, he wants to have a lot of patience, right? don't have that many right now. That's where I wanted to be. If we can get 30 patients a day at Long Beach, that would be nice. Right now, like yesterday, it's less than 20. not a lot. And I just paid per patient. So.
00:32:27 - mark sweet
So she gets between 20 to 30 a patient. So the goals between 30 to 50 patients. And there's not a limit on the number of patients she can see in the traditional sense.
00:32:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So that, all of that is really helpful. And I like that it's going to serve you really well that you recognize his shortcomings and aren't adopting that. Like that, that autonomy, of course, you would want it because you already see how you could do something better or improve.
00:33:01 - Chona Sweet
I already made a suggestion on how to increase, and he's like, oh yeah, we didn't do that, like, okay, this is gonna be a process. I feel like whatever I make decide, as long as it's obviously politically okay, he will say yes, so I have to make sure that we set up dark roots at Long Beach Tomorrow, so that we can see at least 30 a day, that's a goal.
00:33:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And Mark, how fast can you help, like you said, you know, lots of people.
00:33:35 - mark sweet
I'm holding that back until their systems and reports and processes are right because you get only really one chance at it, right?
00:33:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, your reputation.
00:33:45 - mark sweet
Hundreds of other opportunities plus my own personal reputation side into it. So the good news is he already has some PI patients coming in again from what he's doing before. So trying to cut her teeth on those, she doesn't get the same payout. She'll get like more of the traditional payout, but at least. she can cut her teeth, get under control, get the report writing right, figure out how to actually do a better job making sure patients show up because that's a huge issue for this doctor's office. Now on insurance, they're not showing up, it's actually better for him from an insurance perspective because he's paid a flat rate per month.
00:34:20 - Chona Sweet
I don't think about the procedure though.
00:34:23 - mark sweet
No, no, no, no, procedure will get a little more, but like if a patient doesn't show up to the office on the insurance side for him, he's happier, quite frankly. On the PI side, the personal injury side, that means you're not making any money, any wasted time.
00:34:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there's that follow up automation thing that we need to set up.
00:34:46 - Chona Sweet
So okay, he's not very, he's not good, his system is not good. He's hiring more people. There's a lot of non-PI patients that come that they can't get through the phone. So whatever the second income that Mark is saying with the lead, I will have to also drive that and making sure that I am calling, that you're going to have a procedure in this day and make sure you come.
00:35:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In the interim, would it make any sense to do what Fuji is doing and have an offshore kind of team that just does those calls? Because the automations will work better because we can do the text, email call, follow up and it should be cost effective. Plus, we can do all the tracking. But in the interim, without risking your reputation, Mark, and without tona having to be the one to call everybody because that is not the best use of your brain and your time.
00:35:51 - mark sweet
For the problem, we've used Dr.
00:35:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
E before in the past.
00:35:55 - mark sweet
Now, some these have been problems, which tona will be writing them and maybe in. They're okay. It took us multiple months to get signed bills and reports back from him to the point where like a lawyer sued him over and he called me to like to try to get him out of it because he opened for coaching and getting his stuff organized and set out because super busy like I not not yet he's he's going to take over the role mode still.
00:36:23 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, that he's in that mood. They keep would care about what everyone say or he doesn't have any ego.
00:36:29 - mark sweet
He's very nice person.
00:36:31 - Chona Sweet
He just wants to get paid. just wants money.
00:36:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Chaos doesn't take over the world.
00:36:35 - mark sweet
Chaos blows up the world. And the VA thing, we're getting more and more negative feedback from whether it's Fuji or other people who are using it that they really don't like the VA who doesn't know what's going on and a large accent issue. It's a great idea in theory, but I think is you're trying to scale it unless you have the right VA is a balance and issues. So because the volume for P is low. I'm going to believe we're in do everything yourself first so you know how to do it also. Oh, yeah. But until then long term that is not the solution I've shown on calling and setting up that's not the solution.
00:37:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The answer is I do it. We do it. You do it. It's the way to go. It's what I do too. Okay, so do we have other ideas for how to get more more people per day without someone having to call everybody or is that just that's what has to happen right now.
00:37:32 - mark sweet
So right now in my mind is get her feet under her for at least the next like 30 days.
00:37:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:37:39 - mark sweet
Yeah. Get in your sway. Get in going. Right now she's on prescription running power because everything has to get approved. Like you have to get what's it called for the hospital again?
00:37:50 - Chona Sweet
There's a for any doctor to anyone that can there's a process called getting a privilege in the hospital. So it's more thorough, not just background checks, just more deeper kind of employment, I guess, background checks that they do and it takes a while. So now it's been over a month now from Long Beach, so that will take a while. I'm hoping this month it will be done. Is that what you're saying here?
00:38:23 - mark sweet
Yeah, so again, we can't even really get a lot of stuff started till she's got some of these basic things.
00:38:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, that's what I was trying to figure out is like, what's the timeline? So if we spend the next, let's say roughly four weeks meeting, if you're willing to come at least for the next couple mark, because yes. So then we can spend like the next couple calls really kind of extracting the the plan, all the the income opportunities, and I'll put it in a dashboard that will make sense. So we can do some calculations and forecasting for some. potential there. And then Chona can give us that insight about what it's like on the inside, how long these things take, how efficient this process is, how inefficient this process is, and really just kind of take inventory and stock of the operation side of it. And then what we do Chona is just kind of, you know, merge and optimize operations with the financial opportunities together. And where we've got the simplest process to get the most amount of money where those two intersect, that's the most leveraged income. So again, it's a lot of gathering, but gathering from from different aspects. So getting marks kind of planned, your information, feed on the ground, and I'll put it together and organize. And then while you're getting your, you know, why you're just getting used to doing it, and we'll be gathering the data that will then help us to create this strategic plan of Okay. Here's what we do for the next 60, 90 days. Then we do that thing, right? we're observing it as it happens, kind of tracking what's happening as we're doing it. Is it going according to plan? What else are we learning, implementing and inserting that data into what we're tracking? And just, it's an iterative process. So we start with gathering information, sort it, make a plan, and wash runs repeat constantly.
00:40:27 - Chona Sweet
So as of right now, I know that I will be my native Friday. Since I don't have the privilege in the hospital yet, I would do clinics and telemedicine. So that's where I'm at right now on the traditional, on the number one, the main job, basic breath, the main job. The second job mark is holding that back until I'm ready. In the meantime, what I'm doing with that is I'm attending Choice Hall and hopefully where we can be a member soon so I can have access to their ideal note system that way I can incorporate that soon. In the meantime, Marcus is helping me. I show him my notes of the lead, the PI patient, and he tells me this is good, this is not good. And I'm in collaboration with Dr. E to make that better. But all of these, I'm going to have to drive it. It's too busy. Dr. E still busy with this. And the third one, Washington, I have yet to submit the application for what we call reciprocity. Since I'm with that, I have to, I'm licensed in California. I don't have to take the test. I just need to apply. So that's what's going on.
00:41:45 - mark sweet
Question or question of question of question of yet. If we don't do that soon or you have to have Dr. E. Vouch that you have for an active practice in California either he doesn't need to be involved with the reciprocity of Washington, like I just need to apply.
00:42:00 - Chona Sweet
and it will take a month at least to get that.
00:42:04 - mark sweet
We're seeing like three months usually in the doctors.
00:42:07 - Chona Sweet
Oh, Well, the doctors are probably different than the board of nursing. So I don't know, but it will be the board of nursing. But I feel like the Washington one would be the highest potential for income because I don't have to split that with him, with anyone. So I'm excited with that part. I thought she thinks.
00:42:30 - mark sweet
Well, maybe again, you don't to split it. So her, yes, but volume is going to be the question in the problem. Right. So if there's more volume and more procedures in California, she would make more from the California and Dr. E. Yeah, despite having a split because it all just comes down to volume. And I don't have a lot of volume in Washington.
00:42:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know a couple people, but it takes time to spread. Right. And everybody being, you know, having the same type of thought about it. we create the spreadsheet that I'm talking about, Shona, and having all of that, it's going to make all of that easier because we're going to be looking at it mathematically with just really simple numbers, and it's almost kind of polarizing when you see the different opportunities and the things that happen. So it's not so much like that.
00:43:20 - mark sweet
This too is we would still want her to do some of the traditional because it just makes everything else look more legit. Take Fuji, for example, I know keep going back to him I follow it, but he's got the Q and E work, not only makes him money but makes it look more legitimate because Q and E is generally defensive minded. So it makes him look like he's more fair and balanced. If she's doing also mostly health insurance and working through hospitals, it makes it look like she's primarily a primary trader.
00:43:49 - Chona Sweet
Okay, like how Dr. E said it when he was the post and he was asked like this is the same thing I do with my other patients. It's the standard of care. Which is where I want to be. don't want anyone do anything illegal. Dr. E and I are very much in labor. We're not going to do anything, whether the lawyer says we have to do this.
00:44:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We have to stand on our medical beliefs and what is the standard of practice that's where we're at. Good and I mean, it's not philosophy that ever comes up in Sweet Law, but one of my just kind of like principles is have an unimpeachable character, meaning that you do the same thing everywhere you go, no matter what. I will punch an old man in church if he's invading in space and they're like, I don't care. that's not a good example, but it kind of means that even when I'm in the house of God, if somebody is doing something that makes me uncomfortable, I'm going to handle it the same way. Right. you act the same all the time, you treat your patients the same with integrity, obviously honoring the Hippocratic oath and just being there. to do good, then nothing really holds up unless you're just being taxed crazily for some reason.
00:45:07 - Chona Sweet
So however much and organized Dr. E.S. his patients love him. Like he is a good doctor. Like he goes beyond like sometimes the patient is scheduled for example for epidural injections and they don't need trigger point. Trigger point is another payment. He'll waive that. That's the kind of person he is. And I'm actually, I saw it before when he's in training. I know he's a good person, but seeing it now for him 10 years later, it feels good to be working with that kind of person.
00:45:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. All right, now I'm getting a whole kind of picture. And of course, just mark over there being a nice guy with nice people and nice sweet wife.
00:45:51 - Chona Sweet
I do like and she's cute.
00:45:57 - mark sweet
I'm super excited. And so are MPs and people who run businesses too, so you know, yeah, I do I do have friends.
00:46:04 - Chona Sweet
I can I see them their growth and Although I don't want it to say I mean, yes, I see them I get jealous, but I I accepted early on that that's not the path I chose, but now I can say hey I can do this too, okay Yeah, well even in my world I'm in business and I've made people millions and millions and millions and there are female counterparts that I've made way More money than me, but I've had more time with my kids and I coached soccer and I've done all kinds of other things And that was my priority and I picked them up from school.
00:46:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got them up I made them breakfast I went to school three or four times because somebody forgot a notebook lunch or this thought the other and that was my Priority that was what I wanted to do so every night I got that twins, but you pick you pick what you want and there's different seasons in life So you're in a new season and it's fun and exciting and Mark's got people to help you out and you've got people to help you out and you're, you're gonna do awesome. I'm Yeah, I'm so grateful.
00:47:05 - Chona Sweet
Like I told him. I'm so thankful again. I feel tired today. But again, after I talk to you, I feel re-energized.
00:47:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was, I was dragging. I was like, I'm going to pass out. As soon as this call is over, I was ready to fall asleep. So like, Yay, thanks for that mark, too.
00:47:28 - mark sweet
Yeah, I mean, look, this should be good. There's a lot of options here. You know, like to have multiple fasts, not just one. I like it. Flexibility is large.
00:47:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
still want to see the doggy thing happen one day, the doggy food and doggy health.
00:47:45 - mark sweet
I know it has to make money first and be a proven concept and you're not ready. It will happen. This is something that I care a lot about. So, you know, it's about me like when I'm focused, general contestants, but like when I focus on something, it will happen. It doesn't matter how difficult it is.
00:47:59 - Chona Sweet
It happens. It's not a matter of if it's when.
00:48:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I love that tenacity. Okay, well, I don't have any more questions, but I don't know what I don't know, so I don't know if there's something I should ask that I didn't ask. I feel like this was a good start, but anybody have anything else to bring up?
00:48:21 - Chona Sweet
No. I really know my role.
00:48:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You want me to get the operations on my end so I can input it. I just want you to get your footing. I just want you to do what you're already doing, which is noticing what's working well, what's not working well, and get comfortable and then relay that information and that process back. And I want you to not overthink it. Okay, that will really stress you out a lot. I just really just show up, do your best, and know that you're going to make an impact for him, which is going to make an impact for the patient, and you're also going to be able to earn money that makes you feel good because you will know when you earn.
00:49:00 - Chona Sweet
it.
00:49:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, and just enjoy the process as much as you can. Shoot schedule. So you're gonna have to have evenings for the foreseeable future, is that right?
00:49:14 - Chona Sweet
I think, I think for right now, that's what I'm seeing.
00:49:19 - mark sweet
So, would you rather try to do a morning or no?
00:49:22 - Chona Sweet
I think the moment, like I was telling Tina, the moment I know the assigned patients to me, if I, I think once I get the hospital work done, and then I would know my schedule, like I would know how, because it's just right now, it's still up in there.
00:49:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're the only person in the world, I would be the selectable for, but I'm going to be the selectable them.
00:49:44 - mark sweet
going to the to the selectable I'm going the selectable them.
00:49:48 - Chona Sweet
don't have any, like, what I'm saying is, I feel like you have like a midday even in the clinic, there's a lunch break, but I'm saying that if I have you, two, then I can push back the hospital. What I'm saying is I can go after. Like, again, the only one with the scheduling is the clinic. If they scheduled patients for me during this time, time frame, so that would be it. But the hospital, I have no time there. I would go when I can. If I go early, some doctors go at five a.m. a.m. the patient. Like, like, I don't want to do that. mean, I'm not going to wake up the patient.
00:50:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so right now you are at the hospital every day.
00:50:31 - Chona Sweet
No, not right now. still don't have access. I don't know the moment that I get that. I'm I'm assuming. I mean, I'm not. I'm hoping it will be soon because I I did the process in less than a day.
00:50:48 - mark sweet
Mark knows and everything. Yeah, it's just we're just waiting for approval.
00:50:52 - Chona Sweet
We're just waiting.
00:50:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's just waiting at this point. Well, do you want to schedule a week to week for right now, then? If that's okay. Yeah, let's do that. So next week, I have my girls for the weekend, so I like to keep Fridays open. And the week after that, I'm traveling, but we're not going to talk about the week after that yet. So how about next week, Thursday evening?
00:51:13 - Chona Sweet
that work? Yeah, that's okay. Are you okay there?
00:51:20 - mark sweet
I just have something from four to five, but that's it.
00:51:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We don't know.
00:51:29 - mark sweet
You have to come in the evening anyway, right?
00:51:33 - Chona Sweet
Like after that, Shona? Yeah, I'm, I'm the director say evening, if that's okay with you.
00:51:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, yeah, so like six or like what time?
00:51:43 - mark sweet
I think six, it's just mark that I don't know what time mark is okay. Yeah.
00:51:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, well, we said, so I'm assuming that you're not available until evening.
00:51:55 - Chona Sweet
When are you first available and like you have time, you'd be ready for tab a call. I think. I Thursday, I should be available, again, because I don't know my schedule yet, I should be available after five.
00:52:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's what I must, you know.
00:52:12 - Chona Sweet
Okay, I'm just assuming office hours because I like today.
00:52:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so let's shoot for six o'clock and if we need to adjust it, we'll adjust it.
00:52:24 - Chona Sweet
Okay.
00:52:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so it will be the same line and we'll plan on meeting at six and I'll send the calendar invite and then next week we will talk about the following week. Okay. And so next week, Mark, whatever you need to have access to or be looking at to be able to feed me information about income opportunities, specifically, like, is actual data as possible.
00:53:00 - mark sweet
I know it's more theoretical unfortunately.
00:53:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, that's fine too. Whatever we have to start with, but my point is that if you can just have yourself either mentally ready, if you have to be at a computer, just whatever, that be able to have that type of conversation will be really useful.
00:53:16 - mark sweet
Look at your word response, Fred.
00:53:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She just has the general numbers, but who can kind of them? That's an better start. Okay, I am so excited.
00:53:24 - Chona Sweet
Trona, do you have any questions? No.
00:53:27 - mark sweet
Did she hear dogs?
00:53:28 - Chona Sweet
She has dogs.
00:53:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, what? They are not here. They are feeding with fluffy dogs. I have a poussaint. She's a poodle and a bee shan and I have a havinese boy. And the poodle has purple and blue hair dye right now because my daughter loves to be ticker to the beach and her hair was just flowing and the little kids are just like, oh it's a rainbow puppy. We love dogs. And we have birds in a bearded dragon also, so what I was a dad And the bearded dragon he's like this big and he loves to just hang out on shoulders and do you see He's I feed it with life In pics, uh, well he gets freeze dried mealworms. He loves blueberries. He loves kale Oh, Sometimes we will get him live prickets. Yeah, that's my daughter. I like lizards in the wild They're very adorable in the wild. Yes I don't think he should be in a cage. Anyway, I don't like cage down Tina is a big fan of the dog food idea Yeah, um dogs. Okay. I'm not going to cry.
00:54:45 - Chona Sweet
So we're gonna talk about something else Yeah, yeah, I'm excited for this.
00:54:51 - mark sweet
I'm for showing.
00:54:51 - Chona Sweet
I'm excited for you know the future I feel like there's dr. A like we're gonna start slow, but then there's a part of me that I'm good I'm ready to go like, you know, like, but then he I think it's in my head and I kind of verbalize it, but we'll take it slow, and it's like, okay.
00:55:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't always don't take anything slow.
00:55:14 - Chona Sweet
They go.
00:55:16 - mark sweet
It's the idea of slow, but it's not crap. This happens and now we're, yeah, we're.
00:55:21 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, the moment that he have at least 6,000 new ones coming in this October, they're already trickling in. So we'll see how that goes.
00:55:30 - mark sweet
new patient's starting in two weeks. Yeah. What? It's like 10 plus people before then.
00:55:36 - Chona Sweet
Well, let's say, and not all of them are paying patients to collect chronic pain. So let's say at least, I don't know, 30% are on chronic, have chronic pain. But basically any one of them that have pain issue, they can't, they will come to us. So, there's that, there's that new thing too that I will, my name. It will be one of the top again, because I'm paying, I'm going to to push out a lot of narcotics, so there's that too. I'm not thrilled, but I'm comfortable if that makes sense, because it's my speciality, but yeah, it's just what it is.
00:56:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good.
00:56:19 - Chona Sweet
Buckle up, lady.
00:56:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh. All right, well, I am looking forward to it. And I think just a little bit, I've been able to talk to you. I can tell that you are made of some exceptional stuff, and that you're about to be tried in the fire. yeah, but my favorite thing about it is it feels amazing to know what you're made of, but you can talk about what you're made of all day long, and you can feel it inside of yourself. Until you get tested, you don't really know. And the tests are painful, but they come with a level of conviction that nobody can shake. Nobody can make you feel less than when you've done. and the really hard work. And so I'm excited for you to feel a whole new kind of level of who you are and what you're made of.
00:57:08 - Chona Sweet
Right. Thank you.
00:57:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

Hello, hello. Hello, hello.
00:00:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can't hear you.
00:00:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I can.
00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It looks like you said you can, but.
00:00:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You can hear me.
00:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I cannot hear you. I can't of what they're working.
00:00:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Testing testing.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Testing one to. I can't hear you.
00:00:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I went into my own settings and check like aah.
00:00:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you?
00:00:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Good, good, 1996, I was Apple support. You're kidding.
00:01:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nope. No way.
00:01:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yup.
00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I supported PowerMax and the first IMAX and I also worked for Intel as a technician and I built networks and I supported their network adapters and so I talked to people in NASA and the Pentagon and helped them fix their networks and.
00:01:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Holy crap.
00:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's amazing. I can build a network from the ground up like the server including the cables I can crimp the cross over cables and networking cables and I'm a nerd.
00:01:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You're really cool. My first when I left Delight Tush I was actually where for computer sciences corporation when I left Delight Tush they had a hundred of me to go into the States and then when I left them in 1999 I started a software company hosting websites in Southern California and cable Tron systems, the competitor at that time to. that? The big one that's there though, didn't tell anyway funded us like over million dollars to use their servers instead for our server farm and it was a brilliant venture capital financing because like they find us as a million dollars but it was in equipment. So it's a win win for everybody right because that was the most expensive thing at the time. So different now right, but at the time like you could charge $50,000 to build a website and host it for these medium sized companies California.
00:02:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have been in it for a while. Corporate experience was my first business experience I didn't like it's really a long time to get comfortable with certain amounts of money and things and realize that that's what I was doing. Because I did the technical stuff but then I became a technical lead but I was responsible for hiring, managing, training, supporting. meeting metrics, meeting with the clients, meeting with the head honchos at Intel and at Apple. And I would also play Peaceball with them and beat them and then get free dinners because I want like what, learning about staffing and understanding the metrics because we were constantly getting threatened with losing our jobs. They would be going to either Costa Rica or the Philippines. And so the reporting was really archaic at the time and we had Lucid technology systems for our phones before they got bought out by Orion.
00:03:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
think it was or the other way around.
00:03:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah. But, and I fell in love with telephony rooms and systems and IT at that time, but so I figured out how to be proactive about learning our numbers and our metrics because what would happen is we would get yelled at, we would see our person coming down the road now. call centers where all most of them were entry-level job positions. Yeah. people come in and be trained and the managers weren't much better. were recovering drug addicts, you know, like the town that I live in, we rank in the top five for domestic violence and unemployment and poverty, and all these other things. And so that was the hiring pool, which made performing well really difficult. And so most of the head level leaders were imported from other places. But anyway, there was a lot of, you know, not really corporate kind of handling of things, a lot of threats, lot of, a lot of, a lot of, lot of things, a lot of sleeping around, all kinds of more accessible stuff. So, but if anything would go bad, you would just see them just down the aisles like, well, what just happened? Well, they got chewed out by Intel for not meeting metrics. And so now everything flows downhill. I got really tired of having my job buttons. I was a mom and I didn't want to like, I don't want to do this kind of stress. So like, how do I figure this out? And so one of my nerdy friends, who was also LDS, I'm more in church of Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints. Anyway, he's nerdy. And I would see him in Excel all the time. might teach me about this and he taught me about formulas. And I'm like, so if I took this report that doesn't have all the data I want. But if I could plug it into this spreadsheet and then have another tab that got this other report and another tab with this other report, I could pull this data from five different sheets and get a summary tab that had calculations that told us exactly where we are at with metrics. And he's like, yeah. So I took about an hour and figured it out. And so now what used to take people days and several hours to figure out because they didn't even know where to get the data. Which by By the way, the same situation I still find with business owners all the time when I asked their metrics, they're like, I don't even know where to get that. So, nothing's changed because that was, you know, years ago. Yeah, 28 years ago. And so, it would take me, once that started to happen, I just did it every week, every Monday I would get my data, took me about 15 minutes, so I'd import each of them and then just go make sure the calculations were correct and make sure I could wrap my brain around what was happening. They ended up implementing it worldwide, corporation as a worldwide company. And it took me probably 10 years before I realized how exceptional that was, had no clue. But they were using a system I came up with in an hour all over the world. Like, I still think about that, sometimes I think I probably don't appreciate the way my brain works. works and but also this is it simple systems yep so nothing has changed people still over complicate things and mostly it comes down to you they don't ask good questions and then they don't force themselves to come up with the true answer so when i talk with people i saw your post today and i'm like i bet we're very similar to the saying but you will probably ask the question and be like oh wait get the answer go ahead that's how i said i'll just be on a call and and they say i don't know i said okay let's find out and we'll have to go look at this and this i'm i got an hour you paid for it let's go get it yeah yeah yeah well all my other questions i love asking on like more like well it's business coaching but it's really life coaching where a lot of them always say like this is not to be about kpi's or metrics but specific to like you know sometimes they don't know the strategy they should do or that's not the right word but that is i always i think what if you did
00:08:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, like what if you didn't know, you know, you just keep digging and digging.
00:08:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tell me more. Yeah, tell me more is great.
00:08:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so that's interesting about your background. That is cool. So like, wow, have you thought about with your background then? explains why you're still going to what you do. Have you ever thought about starting your own software type company then?
00:08:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, there's a whole lot of things. This is the thing I've had to learn is that I'm really good at a lot of things, which is because I can doesn't mean I should. I'm working on my psychology degree and it has nothing to do with my business other than people also say, can I need you to be like coach Tina today? And I have an attorney in LA and they do about four million a month. And he says, do you help people find their purpose? I was like, nobody hires me for that, but it's happened accidentally. Yeah, you're talking.
00:08:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
There's a lot of skills that I have, but what I feel called to most.
00:08:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. is being God's love. And there's just not enough, but there's very judgy Christians. There's very, there's just a lot of pain and anger. But are you familiar with the parable of the seed? Not the mustard seed, but the seed that landed in the desert, landed in the rocks, landed in the, and got blown away. Like there's four different places, I think, where the seed landed. when it landed in good soil, that's when it grew and nurtured. And so I don't have to really preach the gospel. I can be God's love. I can be the example so that when the time comes and they get introduced or they're ready to live any kind of way, he won't be strange to them because they will have felt unconditional love. Because, sorry.
00:09:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's okay.
00:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But God's house. to the house of water. I bring order to their business and it comes out in their homes. When I help people install boundaries into their lives, into their business, they install them in their daily lives with their spouses, their kids, with themselves, with their friends, their lives change and they become stronger, they come and more independent, they become better leaders, they become more sovereign beings and to me, that's the kind of people that are God's people. So even if they don't really feel like I still feel like I'm serving Him and giving His love. So there's a lot of different ways we can serve but I feel like my best, like I used to post on social media a lot, the reason I haven't been out is because I really felt like I needed to concentrate and think of like when you get concentrated juice versus when it's watered down. potency is different. so there was a time I felt like I needed to concentrate more on my immediate sphere, on my children, on my sweetheart, on my sisters, on my friends, on the closer people. And I feel like I've been able to serve and strengthen them well enough that now I can go out and increase in my circle of influence. But it is really going to be around strengthening people, helping them become their best selves, become the leaders that they can be in their own spheres of influence. And again, there's lots of ways to do that. But really, it is through teaching people, improved operations that, you know, it starts with business, but it really applies to life and they and they overlap because it's people that run business and people that run their lives. I won't be distracted into any other Shiny object and opportunity because this this is my calling for sure.
00:12:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Cool and it's funny like and I don't know how much work will get done right now this call because we can hook another call right um and don't pay for it. just want to the book. Oh no it's fine. Yeah getting to know each other but that like it's fun you know because we all went through a lot of life stuff over the last few years um when my dad did pass away I like obviously I went on a downward spiral because I was the closest to my dad of all the siblings like and I was the youngest one right so the baby and uh how many siblings do you have?
00:12:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's it? How many siblings do you have?
00:12:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Three.
00:12:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay just wanted to put that in perspective okay.
00:12:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh got you have older sister older into all their older brothers and um I think and I'm the only one that's the entrepreneur the rest are scientists chemists and yeah my sister's a uh doctorate in uh pharmacology toxicology and and she's a cool stuff of children's age research you know. When it. like there's more than 90s and stuff, she's retired now. yeah, the other two are engineers, but so I went the business route. But I think also, because I'm the youngest too, I always I realized after my dad passed away and all this life changes about my own inner work, is that I realized I was doing a lot of things to please my dad. I didn't realize that the laughter. And I also asked my mom a few times because she's very spiritual and I said, know, like, what do we hear for? You know, because it's like, what is this early all about, you know, because that was the first close death to me. And it's an interesting, my mom said, well, it's it's to be God's love, you know, so it's funny what you say, because like, you know, lot of people have different answers, like, why are we here on earth is that? But that's why mom says, it can be that simple, you know, and I'm like, wow, I never thought of it that way. So, so yeah, I'm sure there's a reason you're right. Well, I are process connected. We say, if you're big hug, I'm a big hugger. Oh, thanks. Yeah, yeah, so so I've been having fun the last little bit. I'm helping some people with their their funnels and all that, so. I'm not sure which way you want to go, you know, what do you want to take this call?
00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what I want to know is you had notes. You had notes when we talked to you said you have ideas. I want to hear for those ideas.
00:14:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
will pay to hear those ideas. Oh, OK, I have to go up and get it.
00:14:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's in my I'm downstairs right now. Do you mind?
00:14:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't mind. I'll wait. No, yeah, what I'll do just give me about five minutes because I got to go find the art book. I can't remember whether it's up in my office still or over.
00:14:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have like three places in my home I work from. I am not in in a hurry. My life and my work is so leisurely. Maria and the people that I work with, I choose the same kind of vibe.
00:14:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So whatever it takes. I'll just do some stuff. Yeah, give me about five, seven minutes. I'll actually put the T kettle on too and make a cup of tea. And because I, yeah, like I, it's funny because I'm going to take my mom to the art store again soon, I was like, oh, out of artwork. So I have to find where I put it, because it was once after your meeting, it was full.
00:15:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, so give me five, 10 minutes. I'll be right back.
00:15:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
cool, love it.
00:15:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. You You You
00:22:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You All right, she's getting back. Oh, no, it's keep going. I'll just keep breathing.
00:22:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Keep going. My little FTT month slack. Okay. Yeah, I'm right.
00:23:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Cool. Cool. I brought my iPod down to and connected it and we can even just be drawn as if you need to go to. Yeah, I got this an action. can take a picture of it, send it to a boxer after or, you know, yes, please, ma'am. Yeah, I'll do that.
00:23:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let me go with going people about to telling friends about you about how awesome it was talking to you and what your notes look like when we were done.
00:23:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
like, oh, her brain is different. I want to see it.
00:23:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cool. What's like that?
00:23:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm a weirdo. I love it. love it. Let me. Oh, well, you're going to be able to see the picture. But anyways, there's one picture we didn't I remember from the last call that was the beginning as well. So we thought just doing some the audience building with some quality videos. So this thing I just sent you this on Voxer, like it was kind of the videos you see video one and then V2 for video two. So video one is just about client's day with me for nine years. So I thought that was huge. So I really just took notes of some of the kind of repeatable tuples that you say as well, but it was really too, I don't know like what I did, hey, hey, hey, no, Merlin, no, sorry. doggy. Was that a dog? Yeah, yeah, he's I don't know how well you can see it.
00:24:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There he is. Merlin. Yeah. Oh, he's so cute.
00:25:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's probably getting scared because I think there's a big thunderstorm coming our way. You know, when the heat dropped, the heat got so hot, you know, all that could be storms coming. So yeah, the wind now just picked up and yeah, anyway, yeah. then, so, anyway, so yeah, so the thoughts I had were to just start creating this kind of connection. I don't know if you want to call it a connection connection, social funnel or culture, social funnel, whatever the words out there that people use nowadays. But it's really a bottom line just creating these three to five minute videos. We're just giving good value content with no intent to sell right away, even though obviously that's what we're going to do.
00:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're building up your invisible list, so to say, right?
00:25:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So for example, like me, Karina and I have one video. video where I scripted for her and I said, hey, just do this, like 10 reasons to trust us, right? And she's Shopify certified partner. So she kind of lists 10 reasons to trust her like, hey, I've also built a million dollar business on Shopify, still on the boutique, it's still running, all these things. it's not really like, okay, my stuff. It's more just, hey, here's 10 reasons to trust it and it shows, hey, I don't want my mom, you know, with my husband and kids and stuff. so, but funny enough, that video brings in sales. I was just looking at ads this morning and showed the purchase column and it's like, don't know exactly which thing they purchased because we have a few things. That business model is more like what we call the, do you remember the Sears catalog?
00:26:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yes. Yes, I do.
00:26:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And Avon catalogs.
00:26:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you remember when we opened? I'm also Avon and Tupperware and Mary Kay.
00:26:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes, do. Yeah, so like, there's so many ways, as you know, to build a business that makes sales. But one of the ways that I think is like strong now, um, because of technology and social media reach and adds the way it's beneficial to videos. Anyway, like, you know, we all bought through catalogs when we're younger or my mom too, like she's Avon seller and and and Sears catalog come wait to have it come out and go buy. Do you need the Christmas catalog? Yes. And then I busted my marketing chops going through the JP Peterman catalog before the internet existed. So I would like learn from the direct sales master's back then was like, yeah, yeah, Robert Colier. I used to buy for me, be his antique books used to be a pastor and then became. Oh, wow.
00:27:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I did. I did Don Don happy days.
00:27:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, I'm not Don Tom Bosley's SNC.
00:27:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, okay. Don Don the pre's as like, I did my tone and everything. and Melaleuca and everything and a lot of my friends are in direct response and oh cool one of my clients is Brian Kurtz as partner so I've been working with him for six and a half years and Brian threw that as well so yeah it's it's a small world I was I was going through because I do my research and looked at all of your Facebook profile things because that's what we do it's we suck face images and I saw a picture of you with Seth Laraby. Seth sensed my sweetheart my fiance to go on the internet and be on Facebook and now we've been together for 10 years so oh my god small world how we all interact and impact each other in a professional way but in in a really personal way because I was not looking to date I was I was gone through divorce and he was um well I told God if he wanted me to be
00:29:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
with anybody you'd have to drop them on my lap. So I love it.
00:29:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
love it. Yeah. I was coaching soccer and raising four girls and teaching music in Sunday school and running business. And anyway, but, but yeah, our history is amazing. I was looking at it and I saw something you did saying you've been doing this for two decades. I'm like, I've never met another woman that's been doing this this long. And then the post today about people call you like the mom of their business.
00:29:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, I've never heard anybody else be that, but I've been that for a long time.
00:29:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm like, this is just like, how did it take so long to even know? That's what I'm like.
00:29:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But anyway, that's cool. That's cool. Yeah. Well, actually, when my dad started getting sick about three years ago, I kind of hid for a while. So I wasn't really as much. I was buying the scenes as the chief marketing officer for a couple of companies.
00:29:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, so, so yeah, going back to the catalog model.
00:29:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So yeah, we have a of my business model, because I have a percentage of her company, is more selling all the little things like this for three bucks, this for 20 bucks, this for $30 like a catalog model. So, because once they find one thing, as long as they're good quality products. And of course, you just have some mid ticket, like $500 and $4,800 high ticket. But most of the sales are driven through the low ticket. And the exit strategy, we figure for that in a couple of years is the boutique brain software, AI software that we're going to come out with in about August. But so for you, we don't know what path and since you're so open talking about it's cool, we don't know what path even God's going to have for you. But I know that if we start creating your audience, that's something cool could come or we just stick with what you already are, you know, selling. But the first step is like just spend the first month or two, sort of my cats, stairs, it's a bedroom divergent office.
00:30:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think they're just all going bananas because I'm down.
00:31:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
here.
00:31:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's cuddles, but what's going on?
00:31:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, it's only 334 here and she doesn't get fed to five, but she's acting like it's five. So anyway, so one of the things that we should just do is like just like all these videos, we start creating them and then run $5 day ads to them and to find out which audiences are working and which videos kind of work better and then there's KPIs that come into place.
00:31:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, you know, many people stay watching 25% of the video?
00:31:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What's the cost for 25% of the video? Because like when I first started now with Ginger for about a month, it started about $0.70 to $1 for every 25% video view and different angles like Gary Vannerchuk audience, Marie Forleo, a reporter field, digital marketing, software companies, because she builds websites for people. And So, in her case, after a few weeks, we found some of the better audiences and tweaked some of the videos so that she now has more like under 50 cents video view, which is like almost a hundred percent decrease in her cost of building her video views audience. And when you, Green and I have been doing the video views for over six months, we're now down to some videos are getting like 10 cents per 25 percent video, which is really good. Yeah. every day's for sure. Yeah. Yeah. So every week we can, you know, gain like about 2000 people that and they're not just watching 25 percent of the video view, then percentage of them go on and watch like 75 percent of the three to five minute video, which is priming that person then to whatever, say just to choose a simple model, like let's just open and close, Hey, the higher ticket product three days every month. So So for Kreno, we're opening and closing a thing for $500 for the next three days. because we've built up so much brand equity from the video views and value videos and I don't know the right word for it, it's not culture equity, it's not community equity, maybe it's connection equity, but like silly videos too about like 10 reasons to trust us are a little bit more about you, know, like the client stayed with me for nine years. I don't mean that silly, the word silly is the wrong name for it, but it's like not a typical direct response video where you're teaching here's right for you to double your average order value, which are good videos to have to, business, know how to, but the client's statement for nine years just build a, wow, that's a big deal.
00:33:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, a huge person of why people will say you don't keep talking to anybody that doesn't have a personality.
00:33:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I have personality.
00:33:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It will come out, but if I were just to talk about the business stuff and not show my personality, which means there will be silly videos, sassy videos, things like that. It is for people to stay with you a long time, they have to have relationship. You're not going to have a relationship with anybody that is tedious to listen to. That isn't entertaining to some point, and especially that you don't feel so to feel connected to somebody near a neuron being what they are, you have to feel like they see you. How do I make people feel like they're seen through the video? Well, it is through talking about my stories, and I know you've experienced something like this, not this, and the language, the nuance of the language is really important. I have a client, I keep brow beating him with these like, nobody's doing this, nobody's ever seen this. I'm like, you're wrong about that. You haven't seen anybody else doing it, but to be so arrogant as to think that you're eight figure and I'm for your clients. I've never seen anybody do this. They're playing in a different pool than you are. First of all, they're all over the world. And I know people who are doing what you're doing. They're just not broadcasting it. They're secret weapons working silently behind the scenes. But what I'm going to tell you is the one day that somebody besides me tells you, you're not the only one doing this, like it's going to hit his ego really hard. And it's just just being mindful. Like you don't have the Lord over people. Because you know you have a powerful, potent skill. I am incredibly rare. Few people can do what I can do. But I also know there are a lot of people who can do things I can't do. I am cut off at the knees if I have to do everything by myself. Some things I can do by myself which makes me powerful. Yeah. Building my own business, I cannot do by myself because I will lose. I am a social creature. I draw energy from other people. So in serving other clients, there's always other people, but I can't do that for myself. So what good does it do to be great at business if I can't do it for myself, by myself, right?
00:36:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I need people.
00:36:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And anyway, making videos and helping people see one of my, I think special talents is, and I get this from a lot of people is they'll have something in their brain for a really long time. But because they've never spoken in, and a lot of times even they've tried to, and they don't know how to, but somehow I'm able to find the words and it's usually a story or an analogy and say, it's like this, where they're like, I've never heard it put into words. And sometimes it's years that they've never heard the words spoken, they've never heard articulated, which means they've never understood it themselves, and or felt understood by somebody else. And so what I found in my years on Facebook, which has brought me all the business I could handle up till now is that even in my posting, just written text, people feel that, people feel connected to me, people will tell me a post of mind changed their lives. I have people that are making videos that have huge followings that never made a video until I did a video challenge about 11 years ago, and they made their first videos. now video is their life and their TikTok and Instagram and YouTube stuff. And I just think, I don't know how a big ego about it, but I wonder how much I showed up and people were following me and they had been following me, but silently, we weren't connected, but now I've had people send me jewelry that they made. one girl sent me a shirt that said, Team Tina on it. And I just post a little bit of stuff, so I know that. I do know how to connect with people and to the we don't know what God is going to call me to. I don't care what works or how it works. I care that I work, meaning that I shoulder to the wheel elbow grease work. Yeah, I mean, what comes out of it is always enough. I always have what I need as always taken care of. I've been poor, I've been rich, I've been everything in between and that doesn't matter. What matters is that that I'm doing the work, so I don't have a lot of attachment between the work very easy to do because the goal is serve people and I'm taking care of. It's always been like that. God has made it that way. If I will go where he wants me to go then he will. So in terms of like these videos, the picture that you sent me. these are things that I feel so okay. In terms of like what I could get from help with you and it's. also crazy too that at the same time as I found you and I'm like I really want to talk to this lady because you stand out and all the ways I told you you did. I've got these old clients that want to do work and it's a husband and wife team and their kids have watched them grow up and we work together for you here and she wants to do this because I had put together your hosting can I share my screen? Yeah absolutely and I'm just going to the the TV automatically went on down there I'm just going to go turn it off hold on just let's see you
00:40:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, back back back, here we go.
00:40:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I showed her this yesterday, whoops, apparently I'm on my keyboard. That was like this, I'm not greedy. I want to work on a profit sharing model. I mean, not just that, I'm willing to pay base pay because I'm all pizza, I get paid plus rev share. But there's also, so there's a couple things like, for example, my fiance is very wealthy, but I, I keep a very independent work of my business and the biggest reason is because I want to be able to show women what's possible when they're doing it on their own.
00:41:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And that's been a huge thing before we get married. I'm like, I need to have accomplished a certain amount of things, not pride, it's not ego, it's evidence based.
00:41:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
People listen to the people that they feel like understand and have gone through things because I've gone through a lot as a single mom. And because one of the the biggest ways to convince someone is to be like, I've done it. Yeah. So to kind of take the excuses away. Anyway, but the other thing is like, you know, in the men's world, they're ref sharing partnering, helping each other make money all the time. women are just paid. can't tell you how many millionaires I've made, Maria. Yes, I know. Well, going bankrupt, by the way, I fired a client when I had no other income.
00:42:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It was, they built something called Coffee Shop Millionaire, this dude named Anthony Trister.
00:42:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, it took them two and a half years to make a product and launch it.
00:42:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
When they launched it, it's made $80,000 like in a couple of weeks, but then it goes out to $3,500 a month on ClickPink.
00:42:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so they did that two months in a row, they're like this sucks. And his partner's name was Manish. Well, I met Manish through Eric Luvier and job crusher. And because I was working on job crushers payroll for a while, right around divorce, transition time. And Manisha, hey, can you help with some tech stuff? Because I can do all this technical development. I made my bread and butter customizing WordPress themes for a while. Like I can do the copy.
00:42:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I can do the graphics. can do everything.
00:42:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Anyway, Um, so I came in there to help them with some, some tech stuff, some automations, but they had a developer. And the biggest thing that they did was they had created this. It was, you know, make money online activity coffee shop millionaire. He was not a millionaire. So there's integrity issues already.
00:43:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, and what Anthony did was just went around and hustled.
00:43:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He was in the affiliate market and the, you know, the mastermind circuit, all that stuff. Well, by the third month of $3,500, they had asked me, would you be our business manager?
00:43:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because I would ask them questions. are you doing this? Why are you doing that? Why are doing this? Yeah.
00:43:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Finally, um, four months into working for them. So I started in March, which by the way, this is how God is. I had zero clients. I had taken my girls into homeschool because my ex was abusive.
00:43:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I was like, if you're going to get bullied at home, you're not going to get bullied at school.
00:43:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Also, I can't at least keep you here. can watch you more. So I hadn't taken any clients. for a while. So I had no money. A week after I left, I got this job and was on payroll and was able to take care of my family. So God is so good. Anyway, this is all relative to what's happening. So this is my first time making a million dollar company in less than a year. And so took the two and a half years to make it, did their launch 3,500 a month for a few months. And then I'm like, why am I even your business manager? You should go find somebody else because you don't listen to me. You don't do any of things I tell you. You have the same conversations week after week after week and I wrote money. They get paid to hear this stupidity all the time and be forced to listen to this. I have to take care of kids.
00:44:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't want to do it in business too.
00:44:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they're like, fine, we will do what you say. Eight months after I started working with them, they had three other products on the market and they had broken a million dollars in sales. That was not them. partially for sure. But they were spending their rills. They didn't know how to do it. And then, are you familiar with Ryan Moran?
00:45:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:45:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, he wrote a book last year, I think, called 12 Months to a Million Dollars. It was about a company called St. Labs that I helped him build as his business manager. So they were already doing pretty well. But when I came in and I have a testimonial from his partner, I helped them 400 times what they were doing.
00:45:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. No, I remember you were mentioning that.
00:45:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was like, yeah. So and all it was better meetings and whatnot. But anyway, those people will profit share profit share.
00:45:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They were paying me $15 an hour, Maria. Yeah. That's the hour.
00:45:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. Yeah. And so then I was like, I'm no, not going to do this. Okay. So I had to do this whole quitting thing, big drama.
00:45:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They came up, okay, well, we'll you $40 an hour.
00:45:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So within a few months, I was getting paid $500 an hour, but not for from them. And then Ryan called and offered me to one third of his company, if I would come down to Austin and run it for him. He said, everybody's got their prize, Tina.
00:46:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, you can't pay my Ryan.
00:46:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't hate men by any means, bags, and they can be nail and female.
00:46:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And there's lots of I agree, I just don't want to work with them.
00:46:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, so you may or may not have any interest in this. Shando did. And she's like, I will, I will do this. This is not ownership, but it's profit sharing. I want to be able to own my content and what I create because this is my two decades of experience and things. But, and I don't know if you would have any interest in it. I, there's definitely an overlap, but there also could be multiple marketing efforts coming because I create content and you two have very different personalities. And maybe I wait and see what happens with her and if it doesn't work out see if you want to I don't know that sounds kind of do She to me, but I'm also just a Throw everything out.
00:47:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I bomb it and see what happened. Oh, yeah I mean never know until you start working with someone, you know Yeah, we want to go what would the topic of this be this product?
00:47:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So this is So I have a I've put together a We'll call it an e-book right now. It's ultimately going to be on it. I think it's a crap I think it's gonna take a long time No, that's not it. Hold on sec There's my VSL from like 12 years ago for a product I mean I called my freedom systems 20 minute VSL because that was the thing and they worked Yeah, yeah, it was crazy. Um, let me which accounts my Sorry So, so first of all, there's some, these could be trip wires, they could be free. I could do, I've got like nine different things. I think the ones that are the most powerful would be simple finance systems. This is, these are all first draft, but transform your business finances. Actually, you know what, let's go to the time one. I'll show you the time one, because I had people do you know who Tyler Ellison is?
00:48:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, probably if I saw him, I might recognize some of the stuff because he is a media buyer.
00:49:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And, matter of fact, he was the media buyer for sheer strength labs when it got started. That's Ty.
00:49:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We're cool.
00:49:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And he, he's been doing stuff with the Annalene anyway, he bought my program 12 years ago and said that this time sheet homework was worth the $97 out by itself. And I had a lot of people go through it, let me see, open it up real quick. But, and I won't say nobody else does this, but this is definitely not a, everyone does this kind of thing. few people do it. So I have three primary, well, four primary principles, I would say, hold on, principles and priorities, finance, time tracking, let's see those three. The first thing is just teaching people about principles and priorities. And the reason is one of the biggest issues that people have is that in the same reason that we have people showing up to meetings and you're talking about the same thing and it didn't get done. Why didn't get done? Were you not working? Of course not. Of course I wasn't not working. I did this instead. I did this and said, well, why did you not do the thing? Because it wasn't a clear enough priority to me that I knew that that was what I had to be working on. And the reason that is is because we didn't establish values. So even when you're one person working in your own business, a lot of times people just sit. All right. What do I do today? do I need to work on? Well, if you have established that you need to work on X because X is going to give you this and Y and Z can't really be done well until X is done. Then you're very clear that X has to be done because it is, it's the cornerstone. own of everything else that you're doing. But you don't know that unless you've asked yourself what matters. Well what matters. And then you get into and almost all the time people can't tell me what does matter. What they can tell me is what they don't want. They can tell me I don't want to work after six o'clock. I don't want to deal with bad clients. I don't want to do my taxes.
00:51:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't want to do you know what I mean?
00:51:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's like types of activities, types of people, amounts of times and how much money they want to get paid.
00:51:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Those are some very clear I don't want this.
00:51:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But they can tell me what they don't want clearly without being able to confidently say but I do like people can tell me I don't want to work past three o'clock but they don't want to say I want to be done working by three. only want to work six hours a day. It's this weird thing it's almost like they haven't given themselves permission yet. So I removed that. They don't even know I've removed it. They don't care that I removed it because I'm me them say it in a way that didn't scare them by saying, I don't want this because they're good at saying what they don't want. Anyway, all of that can be done in a little product, a little seven dollar product, $20, whatever product. When they've determined that, but sometimes they can't determine that. So sometimes we have to mix it with this activity. And this is the thing that has brought people hundreds of thousands of dollars just by going through this because it's a mindset shift. So when you figure out your mostly profitable activity, I had a real estate agent, he went through this, he's like, holy crap, I'm spending my time doing whatever kind of basic stuff when really my money making comes from showing houses. So I need to get this stuff off my plate. I sometimes people just don't ask themselves what's their most profitable activity. Most people, ask themselves what their most profitable activity is. Then you think about what's the other stuff because you have to know what's there. And then when we get to the time sheet exercise, I'm going to wrap this up really fast because I'm sure you probably have another call. Time sheet exercise, a lot of times people will under predict how long it'll take. Well, it's only going to take me half an hour to write this copy. Yeah, plus six hours, something like that. You know, people tend to underestimate.
00:53:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So once we start talking, I try to do that all the time. Yes.
00:53:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So but once you start to be more mindful of it, you start to be able to better engage and then you give yourself a little break and go, Oh, the reason I didn't get this done is because it takes longer than I thought it did. Yeah. So then you start to give yourself some grace and time things better. So but then a lot of times they'll plan out their work week, but they won't take into account that is gym night. Well, for me, when I go to the gym, the next day I am diminished. I don't have as much strength. and energy. I'm tired. I need like 10 hours of sleep that night instead of eight. I'm going to eat more the next day because I've left heavy weights. And so the day after needs to be calculating what's happening that day, people don't do that generally speaking. so they're just like, I'm dragging what orchestrate a day that is compatible with the activity of going to the gym the night before. Date night, a lot of times we'll energize people if they have you know, a good experience with it. And so I talk about energy sandwiches. If there's something that really sucks in your life and you have to do it, sandwich it in between the really good stuff. Yeah, yeah. So anyway, these are things that and I bought another hour so we could schedule that another time and go through it because at the very least, I would love to have your mind just say, this is what I think that you should do. This is where I think you stand out.
00:55:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's part of why.
00:55:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm talking so much because you have experience so you could say, Tina, I've never heard this where I rarely hear this. We need more of this in the world.
00:55:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think if you say that to me, I'm going to trust your expertise because you've been around a long time.
00:55:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I benefit from you specifically because of that. So my, I'll tell you all my modules if I can get to my chapters. So principles priorities start by defining what matters most.
00:55:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Simple finance systems, what comes in, or it needs to be greater than what goes out.
00:55:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Time mastery, making the most out of the hours you have, things like that. Business and project management, it's the same thing. It's teaching people the simplest, but as you can see, they build upon each other. Knowing what you want to earn and how much you want to earn starts and works best when you have your priorities and your values. Because so many people are like, I'm going to earn a million dollars by that. Why? Well, so and so did. And I'm like them. Yeah. Like, well, that's, you know, that's not gonna make you happy. Anyway, dream team, people want to hire when they have no business hiring, when they have no skill about delegating, when they don't know how to train, when they don't even know how to hire. And they want to go spend $3,000 a month when they're making $10,000 a month to hire somebody.
00:56:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't know how to lead.
00:56:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So a whole long conversation about before you do this. Here's how you do this optimally to get your money back and to increase your energy, not just your revenue, by who you bring on to your team. Optimizing iteration, scaling, which is not the same optimized, obviously is making it work the best you can scaling it is growing what's already working good. And this, I don't really hear people talking about this but sharpening your saw, whatever you're good at, keep getting good at it, keep getting better at it. They're one of the reasons I never lose clients. I won't say never lose clients, but I have it. I fired them. They haven't fired me is because when I feel a lull and they're showing up and we're having the same conversation and there's no excitement and they're like, yeah, everything's okay or everything's good. But they're not like, oh, great idea, Tina. But they don't say that to me for a little while.
00:57:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I need to go have something better for the table.
00:57:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But also I become happier because I'm investing in myself and I'm learning more like working on my psychology degree so I can understand how the brains work better and how my people work better and things like that, including my own children, finding your heart. We lose people, we lose pets, we lose spouses, we lose parents, we lose kids. If we don't fortify our brains and our hearts and our spirits, like filling them up with good books, good stories, good understanding. underdog stories, especially things like that, then when things go bad, we don't have anything in the tank to go and help us through this. But it's inevitable that a human will go through this. That human that's running a business is going to take their business with it. And all the people that rely on them and work for them and the families that rely on their parents who work there. So I just want to fortify the people that lead and the businesses that they lead. And this is what I'm doing. But all of this is segmentable and iteratable, which means there is a tiny portion that I can give away, a tiny portion I could sell at the next level. There is an ascension in all of these. How a person who's making zero money applies this is going to be different than how a person who's making $10 million a year applies this. It's going to be different than how somebody making $100 million a year applies this. But all of these principles will apply.
00:59:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Does that make sense? It does, it does.
00:59:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, like, how does this work? There is a personal story in anecdote several and infinite really for all of these in terms of stories content creation of my own of other people calling in other creators and collaborating with them. This is a this is a community thing like we all need these things we all have had these issues and nobody is ever mastering all these things at all times. No. So, this is timeless. I'm not the expert in all of it, but what I bring to the table is the depth of the conversation so that you and your own skill and your own talent and you talking about these things with the brains around you and the hearts around you are going to be better and going to be four to five for your whatever investment in this is going to pay you back over and over again. I'm confident about that.
01:00:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What's the example Jack's 90-day plan?
01:00:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Whoa, where are we at?
01:00:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, on the left-hand side, I'm looking in the table of contents, yeah.
01:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's realigning his actions with his vision values. Jack set a goal to increase his digital marketing agency's client by 15% over the next 90 days. Using the smart framework, Jack made his goal specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound. He then created a 90-day plan to break this goal into actionable steps, so I actually have like a 90-day roadmap of these are the things that we're going to do. But they're not, that is a pace, and it wasn't actually Jack, it was Dan, between you and me. But the pace is very specific to the person and what happens most of the time, is people get overzealous in the pace, and they're mad that they don't get there, and then they feel like they feel feel feel. And worse, they feel like their team has failed, and then whole thing. Dan is very laid back, so this is much slower. This tends to happen over a year, but we did create the 90-day roadmap, kind of working off of Aaron Fletcher's stuff, but it was already things that we were doing. He's like, Tina, you already have this.
01:01:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You already have this.
01:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, But we don't have it written down. Anyway, Dan is one of my biggest fans who's never made a testimony.
01:01:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's like, I'm not that dude. I'm like, I know it's okay. I was just curious, it's kind of a big deal, too, the 90-day goal setting, creating a 90-day plan. 90. And the other thing that intrigued me is the scaling your business is hot, as you know right now. Hot trend, hot words over productivity, but the productivity time is powerful, but often is the vitamin that you put into the program, and I know you know these things, but... Yeah.
01:02:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm-hmm. Sell them what they want.
01:02:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Give them what they need. Yeah.
01:02:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
them painkillers because that's what they want.
01:02:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Give them vitamins. Yeah. So, yeah, cause I know a friend of mine just bought someone's course and she's going to stop the monthly because it was like no contracts. It was like 300 bucks a month. But she's intrigued by it because the promise was, you know, get a hundred K months. Line with your heart and stuff. But once you got in, she kind of, cause she's already, already wasn't Taki Moore's black belt program. I'll go because a lot of it was all just that. But the interesting part is that he sold her what she wanted. The hundred K and result goal. But once you got in, a lot of it was, which is just important, but she already knew it. As a line in your, your business around the life that you want, run your values so that you don't create a monster of a business that you want out of. That's all synopsis, right? But he led with the hundred K months, but. Yeah. once the 90 day roadmap or something that's always really hot even when I do surveys to people.
01:03:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes so this this the thing is I usually custom customize this them for people and the other biggest problem is that usually this 30 days ends up being 90 days this 30 days ends up being 90 days this 30 days ends up being it depends on the person and how much they show up but generally really there's a whole lot of resistance that happens in here a whole lot of um executive dysfunction yeah I know I need to define this I know I need to crunch the numbers I know I need to ask myself these questions but what happens is is they think about everything that's attached to that question of why am I here after I've been doing this for 10 years they start asking themselves other questions which overwhelm them depress them cause them anxiety and make them want to bury their heads so they do don't do this until they get back on the call and I drag it out of them on a call which is one of the reasons a lot of this stuff doesn't work without coaching because the thing that's stopping you is your own mental stuff and there's nobody there to extract you from your stuff and your stuff from you. It's a huge part of the work and if somebody doesn't have the mental fortitude to do that on their own they're going to continue to spin their wheels until they get somebody to help them. Yeah. That's what's hard and nobody wants to hear that but there's enough people I can sell this to who have been doing this enough that they know that they're in their own way. Yeah. And that they know there is no diet pill that actually will give you the body that you want. Yeah. have to do diet, you have to do exercise. I only want to talk to people who are not trying to buy lottery tickets.
01:05:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
diet pills anymore. There's a lot of tickets and diet pills. You haven't got where you need to be to talk to me. I've already got them for you as well.
01:05:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I stay it all the time.
01:05:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. I get some diet.
01:05:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, right? You want the easy way to riches, you want the easy way to health and it doesn't exist. Now, there is an optimized way, there's a leveraged way, but there is not an easy way. Simple, not easy.
01:05:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
How does this phrase resonate with you?
01:05:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Leveraged I recall it leveraged abundance because riches to me puts a very specific connotation of money. I also don't want to deal with FTC, but abundance is a whole different kind of thing. When I think about even the. for I had a lot of money, I had a lot of wealth, the kind of freedom I had over my life and the relationships I had with my kids, with myself, with God, with my, that was, that was exceptional, even then. It led to the money. So leveraged, leveraged abundance or leveraged wealth, even.
01:06:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But yeah, I like abundance. I like wealth. Don't get me wrong, but there's already, I'm trying to sort of kind of also as you're talking, think of how you can be a category of one as well, like from a branding perspective. Yeah, because in these videos too, like, like typically after the I've been, you know, I've helped create, you know, multi-million dollar companies or sold company in 18 months for a million dollars. Like, I'd say some accolades, right and for you and then you can create.
01:07:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think I can help you with this. I don't know anyone else that was a single mom of four kids who works less than 20 hours a week making six figures growing million dollar businesses for my clients and still having time to coach soccer. I've never met anybody else that could do that.
01:07:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So so so you're you're yeah like you could be known as that I like that yeah that would be it and then also maybe like you're you're known as like leveraged abundance is sort of the portfolio of products that you have or something. I was just trying to think of it.
01:07:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Abundance has its connotation to you. It is what my stressed out anymore. I had one question. client who showed up and he went to all these masterminds and he spent so much money. And he's he's in the guru network. And he's like, I always show up to calls ready to be beat up and I'm intimidated and I'm anxious. And he says, I just feel you love love. Now I beat him up. Yeah, beat him up. I called him out every time I said that , you shouldn't do this that you should not be doing that. No, you should do not. He's like that hurts. He goes but I still feel love and I feel anxious. And and he had peace and he told me that I made him a better father and a better husband.
01:08:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But I was here for work in business.
01:08:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And there's video on my wall somewhere about it that that he left me. And and when my dad's are like, I'm picking up my kids and I'm taking naps and I'm less it's less stress. They're happier. They're less stressful. They're busy. this are growing, I really have, know, people will say, double your income, cut your time in half. I've done that with people over and over again, but that's not the best part. The best part is they were happier, they were less stressed, they liked who they were working with. And so the thing that I tell people is, where do I have it? But it's, I have to sustainable growth and the business that you love. Where the heck? I have an Etsy store too, so I'm good. That's my fun thing. That'll do it right there, I think. Maximized profits, streamline operations, love your business. That's the big thing right there. Whoa, not going to be happy. If you're stressed, you're not going to be happy. If you're broke, you're not going to be happy. If you're hustling and grinding and chasing everything, you can't be unless you're leveraged and optimized. You're not going to love your business. Most people don't love their business. I do.
01:10:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would do this for free if I didn't need money.
01:10:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I still do it. I've done it. I do it for free.
01:10:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've got clients I work for for free.
01:10:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, that I've worked with for over a year, because that's how much I love what I do. And that's also very unique. Not a lot of people can say that.
01:10:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
01:10:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, I don't know what the hook is. I've never known what it is. So many times people try to tell me, ask me, Tina, tell me what you do. I'm like, I do so many different things. It's really more relative to you, which is not a great answer. So to tell you what I have to do, I have to know what you do.
01:10:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I could tell you what it would be helpful, blah, blah, blah, blah, Got you, got you, got you. That's where I started. I go, Maria, no, but I do like all the thoughts, leverage and optimize happy leaders, double your income time and half. Yeah, because, because when you show me that spreadsheet earlier, like the, the other one with the financial performance and stuff, seven dollar to a Facebook ads, like a productivity kind of product working that well, you know, unless I'm just having to.
01:11:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't really think Facebook is the place for me. think you too. And talk would probably be ideal. And I think that whatever I do on one, I'll duplicate on the other, maybe with a tiny tweak, according to that platform and probably Instagram because they're very similar. But my priority would be to talk in YouTube because I think that they have the most leverage compensation opportunity. I think that my personality will do very well on both of those platforms to get people to help me come out of my shell enough to do it. I've really struggled with that because I'm making claims and I am very private and YouTube is not private.
01:12:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All your neighbors see everything.
01:12:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This has been a very separate world from the rest of my life. Nobody knows what I do. There's been a lot of resistance to that, but anyway, I think YouTube and TikTok have a lot of these types of things, actually, and I think that they could do very well. I think at least the first two could do really well. I think the group membership from what I've been seeing, I don't know about that price point, but the great thing is about this, so suggest change to something and let me show you, it's a formula.
01:13:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Our offer, we've been doing really well with filling out $3, and then you'll end up getting 20% conversion rate. It's a change of $3 to $20, which is insane.
01:13:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so look how fast that changed, but let's reduce these then. Let's change this to $67, instead of $9.97, and that's still a very healthy margin. And let's just say nobody bought that.
01:13:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And the 20 should become 17 if that were to be an order bump, because we've tested 19, 20 versus 17, 17, magic number. think it's because 17 plus three is 20. So when people see that, they're okay with 20, but they're not okay with 22. That's weird.
01:13:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I think groups do better when there's a ton of people in there. And if I have to hire help, I'm really good at hiring. I have a whole huge talent pool I could tap into, and if it's making that amount of money, I get multiple people. to come in and help because a huge part of what I want to do, Mariette, give more jobs.
01:14:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I want to be a job creator for women.
01:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anything else that you would play around with in here?
01:14:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So the book, Digital PDF, that is $20 price per unit.
01:14:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Change that to $17.
01:14:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then is that going to be like an order bump in a funnel?
01:14:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that what your vision is? go ahead.
01:14:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Change the conversion rate from 17% to 45%. That's what we're getting right now in our $3 funnel. Conversion rate on the three buck offers between 20 and 30%.
01:14:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm being conservative. How many eyeballs are you getting on these offers?
01:14:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let me share a screen.
01:14:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, you OK?
01:15:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Questions? Yeah. Because we're using with like Facebook ads, so it's often hard to scale. Do you follow Maria Wentz stuff, by the way?
01:15:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like I know the name.
01:15:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, she says a lot of low ticket stuff, having the catalog model, right? Seers catalog game on catalog, you know? But she came up with this. I'm not buying it, but I always see what people are offering and the business coach on Demento, but it's all sheets, level one, level two. What custom business advice on what you should be doing based on what you want. Here's your input, calculate your monthly sales goal, cost the business coach on the mail, spit out custom checklists for you. Like I was like, holy cow. And then she's linking, I think, to the actual thing. she's charged with January seven, but again, I'm not going to buy, I'm just curious. She's always launching some interesting thing, but see level one, getting your first 1k, level two, your first 5k.
01:15:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
thought that was brilliant. I've never seen anyone do that. Yeah.
01:15:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've not seen that either. Yeah, I'll show you the link and it's funny because. years ago, I was thinking of, oh, you know, when someone buys our product, I should have three different levels that, okay, level one, go here to this training level two, but yeah, and that's something I've been trying to figure out, like, how do I segment because all of these are universal for everybody, but they are applied differently when you're in a different place. Yeah, yeah, I love that. So there, so I just I just shot that over to you there in the zoom chat, but yeah, let me log in to click funnels. So because I want to bring up the stats specifically for the three dollar thing. Now our account will never show the stats for the high ticket stuff or 500 stuff because that's through directly through Stripe. And so, whoops, well, I'll drop sets there so you can see here as well. Okay, slow to me. comes up and okay so let's we're just gonna go just go back here for example my filter so that's going take a while so let me just pull up another click button let me pull up the the thing we just launched last week and we're slowly scaling it this is the three-dollar one that surprised us because we're getting like like crazy um conversions on it remember 29 I can't remember whether we launched it on the 28th front after the 30th so I'll just go here my filter so this one's now so this we're going to push the system i.o. maybe because click panels keeps Come here. So, well, I'll just show this to you. So, this is just like a week or like maybe six days of running some ads. And again, it's not including if they buy the $500 thing or they call them by 4,800 high ticket thing. But anyways, this is showing 275 unique people coming to the page. So, I know it's not a lot right now. It's been running for like six days. The option rate click phones is showing clearly wrong stats because I can't believe it up 92%. But we were running at 80%, which was crazy. That's like the initiate checkout. Because again, it's only $3.
01:18:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:18:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
what's is that 73 people bought. So 73 divided by like say take the 229 number, it's showing 31%. So that's insane because when I come over here. And gosh, I wish I could just pull up a whole years here because I'll show you over 100 grand from the this funnel, and again, not including the $4,800 group coaching up sale. Let's just go to April, because to go order magnitude, this will only convert in as $20 the front end. It will only convert at 3%, you know, something around there. Come on, when it's not pre-framed with the $3 offer, like when it's the front end or what? Yeah, is a different funnel that's $2, and this is the funnel, and I'll show you what it looks like online. There we go. So this is the $3 one here. So all it is is just a simple three-minute video, simple headline, a slow headline. This one little testimonial reel, two minutes of just variety of testimonials. Oh. Just ahead. So yeah, um, and then this like We're going back to really because everyone's attention is like pulled in different directions This is like what's converting well now because you see the numbers just initial this is cool traffic. isn't warm traffic Um, so it's insane. That's everything we're buying. So we are now just playing around with the order bump so 38 of bought the order bump which was 19 we brought it down to 17. So we're having better conversions when it's 17 And then these conversions are not bad So we're happy with this even though the average order value kind of sucks when you Sort of look at it But knowing that we have a $500 thing and a $4,800 thing that we sell them within 30 days that customers Average order value blended will be a lot higher So if I just have a different idea and it I know i'm interrupting I'm going for 80d rain.
01:20:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will I've been trying I'm to hold it for a long time, like a whole 60 seconds.
01:21:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's a really long time for my brain.
01:21:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, I am annoying because this is, I'm a five-year-old in a lot of ways. I am like the kid on the playground that goes, do you want to be my friend? And like, do you want to come play with me? Um, I've never met anybody like you.
01:21:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah.
01:21:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to play with you.
01:21:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like, what if we created something together and combined our skills and knowledge and expertise?
01:21:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I don't know this thing because this wants to be worth out of me. It doesn't matter if it's a parallel and it doesn't matter if they're very similar.
01:21:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't believe in their competing because I think that the people that would be drawn to my individual energy are not the same that would be drawn to our combined energy.
01:21:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And even if they are, also, I just don't believe in competition. I don't believe that it's harmful.
01:21:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I believe in abundance.
01:21:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I believe that. the more effort we put in, the more magic we make, the more magic we use to do things in the world. But what if we just combined things and created something together, we could split the work, it could be a partnership. I don't know you. That's not appropriate.
01:22:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's not wise business.
01:22:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I just feel something very kismet, very sadistic about this. I'm getting very emotional. I really get frustrated at that. But what if you just sit and just think about that? mean, I've got another hour that we can come back, well, half an hour because I respect your time, and we've gone over.
01:22:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
took about 10 minutes making my tea and get my book, so don't worry. We'll just do another hour. the answer straight up is, yeah, I would like to seriously consider that because I think it would be fun, first of all.
01:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need fun and I need more conversations Maria and I need more women. I don't not have them. It's just not enough. Like I am trying to really fill myself up but also I'm trying to fill up other women too. Yeah. the more that you talk the more I'm just like, I, I bore you already.
01:23:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love you already.
01:23:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm just okay.
01:23:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, just real quick, just to kind of like close one. No, no, no, it's okay. So, so you can see from this, like the average hour, this is the one that starts at $20. This one only has a 2.73% conversion rate. So, but the average car value is 104. Like we have that dialed in. But this one, once we can dial it in because it's only been working for a week now. Like this is just the last two days. you can see that we've already dialed in like like the order bump is 27%. We're like a little bit higher. But but still like it's a crazy bananas conversion.
01:24:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like 32%.
01:24:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, you know, but but because the convergence so much higher, the cost per purchase on Facebook is 15 bucks. So we're breaking even the first two days, we actually made bunch of money, but I think warm traffic was there. And that's why a lot of them were buying all these upsells, downsells. But it was crazy. But anyway, to make a long story short, yeah, I think whatever the thing is that we create together, we create we charge three bucks, make a $17 order bump, and then just figure out, you know, what, what the, you know, other things we sell them to make it profitable.
01:24:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. And the other thing is that you're already showing up, you're doing the video, you're talking. The thing that I'm lacking most is the conversations in my life. And is that I don't want to sound arrogant because I actually get very cringy about this. But I can't tell you how many people were like, you should write a book, you should have a podcast, you should be on video, people need more.
01:25:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
for you.
01:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could listen to you read the phone book. It's the weirdest thing.
01:25:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know.
01:25:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
get people are drawn to me. But I in it. But I get fed from them. It's not a I gotta give everything to the world. Yeah, I need that. I can't pour from an empty cup and I'm doing a lot of pouring. And I need to be filled up. But I get filled up by serving. And I think that your personality plus your brains plus your work plus your skills would be amazing. And I think I could match you and I bet you're not matched very often.
01:25:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No. Yeah, yeah, I think I think the match was and he sort of had heart condition. So we aren't able to do a lot of stuff with us. Seven years was Carlos Navarro. He was the guy that's the chief technology officer he was for Nobel Networks. He was one of the original guys there.
01:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you may have heard his name before, but he's brilliant tech or known him and friends with them. But I haven't seen him for
01:26:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Exactly, yeah, he went he they almost recruited me, but I didn't want to move to South Korea The emotional intelligence software that we created about more than 12 years ago and Google's Eric Schmidt chairman of Google invested in it We sold that off to a Korean company that is now using it in hospitals for dementia patients And he became the CTO and moved to Korea and that was about five seven years ago because they wanted to recruit me too But I said no, I can't leave my family my parents and stuff But he didn't have serious heart issues, so he's really just Moved away from from being public the last year went back in health and he now is a little bit more in public, but yeah, he Yeah, so anyway, but yeah, that's only one match with but on that note, you're right I do have 430 call though now, but yeah, you have the link right just book again with me and yes We'll go You

Hello.
00:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hello.
00:00:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What's up?
00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not my energy levels because I've been getting up at 5.30 in the morning for the last couple days because I have a seminary student now.
00:00:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You have a what? Seminary. oh, oh. I thought you said something about a son. I'm like, wait, what? have a son in love. I thought you were going to say to jump into your ice bath and then expose yourself to sunlight.
00:00:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, you're not.
00:00:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Never. You're not doing that.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm using myself.
00:00:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no.
00:00:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I was like, wait a minute. Never no matter how many times that should tell me it would be good for me and a rim hop and blah, blah, blah. No, never.
00:00:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I've never done it.
00:00:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me, I want to send this to you. I'm texting it. These are my past clients, current friends, very smart people who are
00:01:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
um they used to do before covid they were agency um and for yoga studios and amazing like they spent a little bit time creating marketing campaigns and they blew these brand new so it was like um great the guys that make smart tools are your clients yes oh that's funny i know david what's his name bought this and met like no as a customer oh yeah yeah he met them at the high level event he met Jason and chandel uh i believe so yeah and i think he's a subscriber so but mostly his daughter is the sort of the face of that but yeah when david and her went to uh Austin i forget where the where the thing was but yeah he he was so funny he goes i met the number one affiliate for high level and i go uh cooch and he goes yeah um Did you know that? like, I know him. I've known him for years. He's like, that guy's the number one affiliate. I go, I didn't know that. I know he was partners, maybe with the number one. Anyway, David's a subscriber that Jason also had, uh, he had this one thing that it to no longer needed, but I almost bought it be. I mean, because there's somebody else that does something very, very, very similar. I'm a subscriber of the other guy. I'm not a subscriber of Jason. David's a subscriber of Jason. I'm a subscriber of, uh, the other dude. can't remember his name, but I use power tools or something else like that too. It's very similar. Yeah, I have that one. David has, David has Jason and David matches.
00:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So Jason's a beast. He's super tall and she's really short and they always did video even though Tina never did. I'm really good about it now. And she used to be a hairdresser. And they. They used to do media buying, but they did all the campaigns. They created all the marketing and really just the whole growth business plan. And then they did the ads and they wrote the copy, they tracked everything. And they did amazing for these yoga studios that then COVID came and shut everything down and went to here. But Jason, they're both brilliant. Chandel loves the systems and the marketing. Well, he loves marketing too, but so he loves marketing and the tech. And he is really brilliant at creating the tech and snapshots and creating the automation and she loves the marketing, but does the customer support, the hiring, the deadlines and all that other stuff. and I've watched their kids grow up and yeah, anyway, but you know, to me, they're kind of like under the radar, but although I've I mean, their group is just growing.
00:04:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And I see people in here that I know that have done a good job. He gets called out fairly frequently in the main group for a couple of his bits and pieces. Oh, does he? Oh, yeah, yeah, for sure. That's awesome. Yeah, right. you're saying, hey, man, the other guy.
00:04:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're like the two go to the tools. got, oh, wait, wait, wait, okay.
00:04:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Because I'm like, no, it's a wife. Okay, I just want to make sure I don't save you. Yeah, I can't think of the other guy's name, but yes.
00:04:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I think I got their stuff and they offer like, they call it like white glove service or something like that, where you don't have to do anything for your people and they'll do it all and.
00:04:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, no, that's yet another guy. Yeah, that's like, it's Stanley. There's two of those.
00:04:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's fine. There's like two of everyone. Well, what I love about these two most is that, I mean, they're just super smart. And I don't know, like Jason just gets excited about this. But he has the balance of Chandel, who is like, okay, but we need it to be this and just kind of whatever. And they also have Tina thoughts in the back of their head, although I'm telling them, okay, don't do this, don't do this. I think that's fun. So anyway, but like, as far as like collaborating type, they're just, they're, they're mom and dad. They're at hockey games all the time. He cooks like crazy, amazing food. She was an air dresser, so she still loves all the beauty stuff. Anyway, they're just so laid back down to earth and they're in this world, but they're not schmuckery's like, just, you know?
00:05:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
do. Yeah, because I think that, you know, the good thing about high level is that the people that got in early, like then, like a lot of these tools providers, the early onset people, they were solving real problems. With real solutions, and now you have the hacks coming now you have the this Not just the bang whiz and you're like okay, whatever and it's someone that's been using high level for like a week And they bought some of our snap shot. No reselling it Thank you. Yeah, okay No, thanks Oh God now what happened Do that again somehow the audio button is just like Below my browser cuz I'm not looking at zoom.
00:06:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was behind my browser, but apparently it was just underneath it and so I was clicking Anyway, they had given me a high level account, but she was like tini you should just really have an agency account like Okay, I didn't think about anything. I'm like I just don't even want high level whatever But now that you're talking about it, and I know and you got that one snapshot. I really do think it will be in my best interest to understand this for I just see their growth like I was turned off by the whole Frankenstein code. Yeah, but what I see now is almost like I'm trying to think of the word but it's like socialism. Like I mean open sources Frankenstein code, Franken code basically all the things that are built off of it and so and also I'm telling myself there's no first of all I don't like anything being housed under one roof but this really isn't that because let's say high level did something really stupid and just blew it up whatever there's now this whole community of people who for sure even if they're not coders have coders who can very quickly pivot and splinter off a whole lot of related things because we're all now having thoughts we've never had before, it used to be owned by an entrepreneur or an infusion soft, and you couldn't compete with them. And now this is like a building full of all of the greatest minds helping to build it. so it doesn't feel as much of a death wrap is like, anyway, something else.
00:08:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So only way goes sideways. And I'm not sure it can even go sideways, but what will be inevitable.
00:08:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And for those of us that have been in the game long enough, it's like in a huge, a huge enough.
00:08:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Remember when everyone was an infusion soft affiliate? Oh, is same thing's gonna happen here. Eventually that affiliate play no longer exists and they get rid of it. And then that turns into we're gonna raise the price.
00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yes.
00:08:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, that's it. Here's down the road, right?
00:08:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know. because the pace of everything is exponentially faster and increasing. I don't, I don't think that timeline.
00:09:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I see them doing it right now to through these add-ons, right? So a perfect example would be their, their, I think I'm not exactly sure what the relationship is here. So they have the conversation AI add-on. It's not have gone too deeply into this. It's not clear to me if it's theirs or if they have a licensing deal with someone else and it's, it's that. But either way, that add-on per account, 40 bucks.
00:09:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's huge.
00:09:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. That's a huge markup. That's a huge price. I even know what the markup is. So I see them doing that. Like they, they create certain add-ons and that's actually a way to get more money without raising the price. I'm like, they can do that too.
00:09:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I see that. I mean, because that's what everybody's doing is talking on to it. So anyway, but bottom line is I definitely do want to get into it and learn it because the one thing I do know is that somehow I'll think of a question somebody hasn't thought yet and then they'll be a day on and be like, you'll have a thought. There's no possible way I would think what you think. I cannot even come close to the things that you think. But when it can be as a catalyst for you thinking what you're thinking, I'll do that. Check it out. Yeah, so did you push that button yet?
00:10:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I didn't, because when I went to push it last night, my browser would not cooperate and I'm like, I'm just going to shut this computer off.
00:10:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is a sign that today is over.
00:10:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I couldn't even close the time. oh my god, I'm going to close this time. But I will set it up right after this fall. Because it's Thursday, and it's Paul's day. It's Paul's in random tasks day.
00:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so there you go you know what i don't know if you would ever need it like i need it because i do but i do so many different things but you do so many different things and it is this extension called work on i'm sure i've told you i've used it yeah i use it religiously do you i i didn't see the i always have two browsers open and they're color coded because they're each in different google accounts which just makes it easy because i always have two i always have my mission tab open constantly because when i get a few breaks it and also it just serves as a reminder hey i've got to go get some work done there yeah so feel 12 hours doesn't seem like a lot but it is a lot but then i got it yeah and it also has to be concentrated work so anyway Um, so I have those two open, but then so I can switch in between each client, but then I have one that's like for my course and ones that's just AI research because I have all these different tabs that I'm looking at and one for finances and, um, one that's like, I have few miscellaneous, I have one for school because I'm back in school and Etsy and like all kinds of different things and it's so much easier to switch back and forth. And I do catch myself opening something because I'm in a browser and I'm not in that tab and like, oh, switch it. But then I can just easily go move that tab to the workspace that it belongs. You have to pay for it. If you're only using five spaces, it's not worth it.
00:12:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Um, but right. But you could also do like, just go, this is but like, the way that I end up being effed is like, I'll have essentially three workspaces open across 20 times. And it's like, oh, all this ninja stuff should be over here. And then over here should be empire. And then over here should be fan flowy. And then what I end up with is just the row of tabs and they're not even next to each other.
00:13:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, which one is it? So, so you're selling me? Yes. Because also I have my computer is amazing and very fast. It can handle a ton of browsers. But it's browser windows, but there's still a limit to it. And I am one to push those boundaries. So this makes it easy. And I don't want to have to bookmark everything. And I lose stuff. And I don't lose things anymore. But also it serves because I've got that row of spaces on the left. Like, Oh, yeah, go check on that. Oh, I need to go check on that. So because I'm always in there choosing a space every day, I'm also getting a reminder of the things that I look at and work on most without having to be in a company. Completely separate app like a reminder app or my calendar or something else going.
00:14:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah, go look at that So anyway, I've been you know you can you oh you don't have back, but you can reduce like Okay, you can reduce that down right so that it's then in the bar and you're like, oh, that's my throat That's my basis work. I'm and then I could just launch that right. I literally have one called basis Okay, I'm gonna have to go. gonna have to this might be what I do this afternoon because I it was like I actually started feeling that it's the perfect time to start feeling that this week damn this is getting You know, it doesn't work and then I get to this place where I have to use the one tab because everything's just so janky and Then one tab reduces everything down to links, and then I'm like I never go back to it No, like they're there right. That's exactly the problem.
00:14:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm like I never go back to this That's why this is such and Although
00:15:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But it's like a cleanse, like, yeah, but that's always bad, though.
00:15:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because you need the tabs. Look, we're a tap your brain has multiple tabs open, your computer has multiple tabs open. It's just, it's the way your brain works, but I'm being able to switch from different devices. could log into my Chrome account on somebody else's computer, log into work on it and have all my stuff anywhere and just what you can.
00:15:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. That's a problem I run to run into when I'm making music is because that computer is not my computer. But I have to sign in sometimes is me and sometimes as I have a shared account for Apple for that. And so, so it also has a email address. So sometimes I have to use that, but 99% I use me.
00:15:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All you have to have is have whatever browser you're using install. We're gonna as a plug in on that machine. And then it's all into your Google account and you have all of your tabs open, right?
00:16:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Dealing.
00:16:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I just might be pop open as soon as you click on the thing.
00:16:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, that's interesting.
00:16:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yup.
00:16:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I need to. I do that too. I'll sometimes be on my laptop and then I switch to that computer and I have to look it up again.
00:16:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nope. It stays. It's transverse.
00:16:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, so what will happen though is I'll go on my laptop. So then all my bookmarks are inside Workana because that's the other thing because then I have to redo bookmarks and but I don't because I'm like I'm not doing that.
00:16:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, you don't and let's say you have a tab that you open frequently but you don't need to have it open all the time is let's say you've got 30 tasks tab work. Yes. Okay. So what you can do is save that as a resource and you can save it as a resource across multiple things. maybe. teamwork across spaces across street law anything else like that and you save it as a resource with one click to multiple workspaces and it's not an open tab but it's still easy for you just to go and click from the work on a home screen. Okay so here's the other thing so like let's say I have the tabs open my mission tab on my desktop and then I go open up my laptop and it says you were already working on this in another location do you want to resume work here and so I can say yes and it just takes over the most recent tabs and then just so the work transfers let's say I closed tabs on the laptop they're closed on the desktop when I come back to it.
00:17:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh wow okay. Interesting.
00:17:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just client I told him about. He's like yeah it wasn't. I'm like, and you're not using it right.
00:18:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
promise you because. Right. That's exactly the message I'm getting. But it's also like I just there was no there. That's a perfect example of they don't really tell you I'd use it. Yes. You're like, how am I supposed to use this? Like this is like a mini course, right?
00:18:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is like that's exactly that. And I think I'm like, I need to do some of these little hacks. Let me make sure my daughter's OK. Yes, OK, yeah. When I teach people stuff, because it is these little things.
00:18:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, Tina, Yeah, yes, but that's the other thing, too.
00:18:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like finding examples like this because a lot of people have really amazing stuff, whatever it is, do a terrible job of marketing, especially local, like local businesses. I just I look at them and I think I've never seen it out of yours like ever. And I just anyway, whoa.
00:19:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, yeah, totally.
00:19:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:19:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Market's best wins.
00:19:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It markets at all. That's the thing. Speaking of markets and market share.
00:19:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And another 71. How are we doing? I think I did the math roughly a few days ago. We're like, we're up like 16%. So we're gonna we're we're approaching 3.6 million. So we're we're on. I mean, I think we can get back to four because that's was like our apex. And then I'm still some of my Mercer stuff didn't work. And then some of it's not going to work. I got another answer from them today. So for yesterday, so now I got to go check. I set up some new stuff. going to make sure it's working. I think one thing is messed up. I'm going to have to ask them why it's partially working. But I got to peek at it really quick. first but if Mushi's new thing is tracking and the stuff that I overlooked that I added is working and then I got the video thing's the one that's broken I got to get help fixing that then I'm like done as far as like all right I know how to set a custom event Mushi I know how to set these other events these on page events the standard sort of built in which would be the video one then I know how to do sort of the his his ace events set those up don't know how to do them in GDN yet because they weren't working so I haven't taken that up with Melissa yet but if they're working I can get with her and then I need to go I still need to go through one more module now then I can go into the advanced JavaScript and just see if there's which is essentially what I did with Mushi anyway but that was very specific to me I want to see what they say like is there anything from that that makes me go oh that's interesting oh I could do that uh so ideally I would get that done I don't do it today or tomorrow right next week but then we're also going to visit Santa Cruz next Thursday so yeah so I can't be on a conics Thursday although I totally didn't think about that when I put the flight but I'll be on a flight or I'll be touring the campus I'll be doing one of the other I know you don't like calls on other days but can we reschedule yeah we can do it on Friday if you can do it on Friday or okay yeah Friday are gonna still be there because I can move it to Wednesday if you'd rather move in and out Tina boom boom okay we're just doing a tour and getting the lay of the land and then and then in two weeks we go back again for the movement Thursday no on a Saturday
00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay cool. I moved it.
00:22:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
then that that one we might stay over.
00:22:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, would you like it any earlier that day on Friday?
00:22:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I can do whatever because that's that's why it opens.
00:22:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, we'll leave it right there at noon then. Okay. It is moved it in your calendar. right. I'd like to I'm gonna tap.
00:22:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I was booking the flights and it was like, okay. And oh wait, that's September 11th.
00:22:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am not flying on that day. Oh my gosh.
00:22:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There. That was like literally about to hit purchase.
00:22:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I go way to say. Ha ha ha. You're like, no.
00:22:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Encore. No, thank you. Yeah. No, I'm looking for that. Any day would be a day to send a message. Right. Probably that. So I don't want to be a part of a message. Thursday it is.
00:22:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's crazy too how many people had stories of they were supposed to be traveling that day, but something happened or somebody said go or They knew they shouldn't go and like, why am I?
00:23:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:23:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, so you were about to tell me when you think it was going to get done.
00:23:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then you. So I'm going to try to get it done next week. So I mean, I could probably watch a bunch of it on those flights, too. So that's ample. Airports are great for that stuff and flight.
00:23:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My throat is killing me because I almost literally choked to death. I thought I was on a call talking to my friend. And I'm like, I'm really, truly going to die. being here.
00:23:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Just just be aware about to die.
00:23:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I had these capsules and they got wet and they stuck to each other. I'm such a miser. I could swallow that. almost did not able to. And it was mind over matter because I had to keep shoving water down. But the water wasn't going down. And I'm like, it's just coming back up. And I'm I'm just in suffocating. as a role, by the way, especially for an asthmatic when you've suffocated almost to that many times. Well, lovely. Well, I'm okay with it. It hurts now.
00:24:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Anyway, well, then it feels like they're still there. That's the worst part.
00:24:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Fortunately, that is not what's happening. Yeah, but it's just like everything just feels like if I swallow again, it feels like I have a sore throat, but I'm for all that it is, I'm like, thank you, God, thank you, God, thank you, God.
00:24:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, not dead, not dead.
00:24:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, literally. When I could finally talk again, she was just talking, she had no idea. I'm just going here. I can't believe this is happening. Like, and I'm trying to dream what I was soaking wet. Anyway, it was an interesting morning.
00:24:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Thought it's your dad.
00:24:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No draw, though. No, no, no, Exactly. We can just watch ourselves die. I feel like, I don't know, it's just surreal. Anyway, okay, so we're going through that and try to finish it by next week. And then what's the next?
00:25:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, ultimately, I would like to have tracking goings that we can go into 2025, right? January, we'd be like, all right, it's a normal year, supposedly. And then we very much know what to expect, right?
00:25:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Q, how is it?
00:25:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
When not like 25, that's like a penny, but it's like, we're all intent, right? It's like, okay, no COVID, no, no exam changes. That is a change, but it's a positive change. I guess it's not totally normal, it's normal, or, I mean, I'm going to find out how many more that actually is, because I don't know, but the, and then just have, it's like this stuff is going to, should settle down in November, and then where people exit isn't December like all that stuff will happen as as it does But then it's like, okay, where are we really at if we keep this 31? Think I mean, I think 31 is 4 million if I'm not mistaken So it's like we've never got past that I Guess we could but it's not on purpose But if the numbers 31 it's like okay, 31 is the number to be and And then we'll do I wanted to advise a plan based on data shocker to figure out how to beat that number What was See this is why I need to make my dashboard, so Orange new subscriptions, okay, And you think that's for money, okay I Think that's for you know, that's our ideal number based on historical data. It's like that's the best we've ever been and kind of thing. So, we'll see.
00:27:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, just out of Thirty-one puts you over four million.
00:27:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Thirty-one, yeah.
00:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Roughly. And we'll find out where if the ceiling is real or if it changes because of all this stuff. So, I just, I'd curiosity, don't know how this works because I don't know what the different sections are. But I wrote how many score releases for CPA Exam 2025. This is the course Becker said, the course sections will be available with continuous testing and 16 different score releases release dates in 2025.
00:27:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The core is odd for in reg.
00:27:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's four sections in that, right?
00:27:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes, it'd be other sections. I forget what they're called, but those, Those are probably so all the additional score release. So I guess this is what they're doing. There are now section dedicated score releases. So the score releases that the score release. The core score releases usually where we get our huge bump and that will not be we won't be as effective as much because the number one section is far. So it's still in core. Therefore, their back is gone. Back is going to be those other things. And back is this I think the lowest section. So if anything, if we will either get the same outcomes around the score release or nearly the same, and then you're just going to get all these bonus outcomes around the supplemental or whatever. And there's three tests in that. But you only have to pass one so it's like ISC TCP and something else they pick one they have to pass it We don't really know the failure rates and stuff yet because I'm not people have taken it to fail But that number will be more solidified by Certainly by the end of the year If I add these up, I think it was around 23 and I don't know if this is right But I would imagine What do they call them the other ones?
00:29:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Disciplines the other ones are disciplines 16 And there's no other But unless 21 22 23 24 25 Are these
00:30:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, that's this year, right?
00:30:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's right, right.
00:30:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's why. Those are the remaining ones.
00:30:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:30:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. that's all of them. So, I'm pretty sure that's way more core releases and core releases are where we crush.
00:30:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right.
00:30:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And so, we should benefit just period, finally, something might go in our favor.
00:30:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, 16 core releases, how many are there normally?
00:30:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's, there's been no normal, right? Oh, yeah. stopped doing them. Last year, they changed it, right? So, we'd have to go look at like 2019. I'm sure someone still has that post it somewhere, but I don't know about that. I'm That's something. Yeah, that sounds right. It's like, I was going to say, it's like two or three a quarter.
00:31:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So five more score releases than 2009.
00:31:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Five more core and then totally new ones. Well, not totally new, but they're new as of this year.
00:31:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
2018 was 11. I it. I'm thinking 2025. And do you really good for another spending?
00:32:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, yeah Does Jeff know how good he has it with his van? Yeah He should just making sure yeah, he just doesn't like He just doesn't like when I say no Don't like it. I already know where your hands is going to be. No, but let me just get it out.
00:32:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I go. No Hi Yeah Good like he's waffling on he's waffling on doing the new products.
00:32:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm like we are doing it And he tried he tried to argue You know argue his point on monday and he's saying, you know when we did We did the subscription thing. I go dude. Well, we did the subscription thing I knew exactly what was going to happen If we did exactly what was on the sheet and we did you even call the timeline pretty close Yeah, yeah, it was all map. So here I said, I don't know what's going to happen. So he wanted to lower the make of the low end price $47. I'm like, no way, man. That's a bad idea because you're baking in a potential failure. I'm like, it cannot be lower than 67 because worst case scenario is everyone buys the 67 still and we have achieved nothing other than there's now a clear separation between a supplement and a course. And yes, some people will buy the course, but we have no idea. My argument is we raised the base price $10 and then we sell the other one for $87 and I'm sticking to that idea. And we're baking in growth. I mean, Jeff has had a winning idea or two, Oh, yeah, totally.
00:33:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He comes up with stuff that I don't. But when it comes to the math of these types of things, I mean, the odds are in your paper for sure.
00:34:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and it's, I mean, it's come out. She also wasn't understanding, I got, dude, we change the price of a subscription, we are starting at zero. You're literally erasing everything because we have no data on a $47 product. So then you have to wait 18 months based on our AOV or LTV to know what's really happening. go, that is not worth it.
00:34:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So, I saw a post of Noreos today with his watercolor.
00:34:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
you see that? No, I haven't mapped it on the Facebooks at all. What?
00:34:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
a good distressor, but he's very proud of it. And it reminded me of Eor. So I thought about Mark's view. Terrible. They have that correlation. Yeah. So. It's not, I don't think that this is gossip, can not say anything, but, which is very interesting to me to get to talk to Chona, and I don't know anything about her other than you tell that people said he shouldn't marry her, but she is very enthusiastic. I'm like, is this going to be like when a, you know, husband recommends his wife to something and there's a strange woman, but she is so excited to work with me and so enthusiastic and so open and just really like kind of incredible, like the kind of person like, I just like, I love you, like, you're just so awesome. And anyway, and the first thing, well, the only thing that came up was, she's like, see, have to check my brain and be like, is this okay to share or whatever. This is between you and me and also, I think that is some type one good because of the. don't see intimate level we work with Mark and I mean that as just talking about the hard things that he goes through. We're not the average business people.
00:36:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No.
00:36:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But the biggest thing is that she's like his brain is like zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom all over the place and I could do this and I could do that and she's like I don't understand how that works. I'm like calm down. I don't like you know so he's got these big dreams and big visions and she is just starting to because she's a Filipina woman.
00:36:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:36:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Women in general are are bred to do a particular type of thing but especially in certain cultures and definitely in the Philippines and it's not to dream big and do big and act big but she's in this world where she's around very successful people all the time and thinks you know I could have that because Mark encourages or Mark thinks that she can do so anyway I can see how that would there would be a lot of resistance of not knowing how to to be in a world where you come from a culture of, I don't know, not the flash that Mark is around all the time, you know.
00:37:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah, totally.
00:37:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, she's just like, I just, and I told her what I would do would bridge would be to bridge the gap between his excitement and his big vision and pace it for her and explain it to her. But I don't think that he can because that's the thing that I do, I think, really well as liaison between different types and personality types. And she's like, oh my gosh, that would be amazing. Anyway, she's, she's excited and I'm excited about it. And so anyway, I'll show that because I just think that that's cool. I also humbled and honored, I guess, if anybody puts you with their family member of any type, I just think what a compliment. So, thanks. also you gave me again. And also D&D company, I want to give a thanks to you guys, but
00:38:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
because there's going through things I know but you didn't but you didn't give me any ideas you said you gave me ideas oh i think i think so fixated on this like getting the whole moving like can't talk about it because i'm like it's happening like it got dropped in my lap and then but it's like people around her acting very weird right just like okay i'm gonna make this happen moving a needle in right yeah not you guys okay no no yeah that whole thing is like now it's real becoming more real right and it's but also it's like none of us know what it's right it's like it's just conceptual it's like yeah so what happened yeah yeah but even in the beginning it's still surreal until holidays or something happens and
00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She needs you and she can't immediately get to you. Although you've got way more resources so you can do that quickly. But, yeah, it's, uh, exactly. Thank you.
00:39:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's why I dand signed up for Southwest credit card that gets points.
00:39:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And gave Denise one and said, you can do this whenever you want them.
00:39:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Both, both you.
00:39:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They don't like you, but they're going to know you're amazing.
00:39:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Good job, dad. Good job.
00:39:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, anyway, if just a type of gift basket, something, if you have some ideas, I don't want to nag you about things or bug you, but you forget. So I'll just do texting and teaming until I get an answer. Okay. So Stacy said, um, I got more questions. But in terms of like, you said Bobby finished, she wasn't aware that he'd finish in about as I was wrong. Yeah.
00:39:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay.
00:39:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Yep. Um, but it's getting worked on still.
00:40:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so I didn't realize that he so him and I have had a conversation about, uh, we're using like reset you as the example. So I think we had this conversation on Thursday. So like they made another request for, I'll just say a funnel. And the problem is that this is so sad. Apparently nobody can scope this except for me. Because Abish, I could be Jay's version. was like, Oh, think that's right. Bobby's version. was like, eh, that's not right either. And then Dan's version was, can't we just do X, Y, Z? And then those guys are like, yeah, we could. I go, OK, well, then let's that's how this is done. But then it and also my part. the problems then. And then I pointed this out. In the future, this would be a template. This would be a cloud template. So let's keep that in mind. Right. So in the future, if someone didn't, basically what I was like, Hey, no, no, no, we can just copy this funnel kit funnel and swap out the product. Done. Now if they want this to then go into lead flow or whatever, like this funnel does, then we need to, you know, estimate those hours or how much I can be doing this with those hours, which they can easily do. And I was like, but if it was just in the future, it was like, Hey, they want sales page. Well, we're going to have like sales page, ABC. And then we might have funnel AV that we might have phone or we might have whatever, right? And but it would be a cloud template. And we would say, so it would be launch cloud template, create product if it doesn't exist, attach product done. So we figured that out and then that reduced the scope, essentially, then, mean, I have to check in VJ's rate for that is like 25 bucks.
00:42:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:42:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So Bobby's like, what, what, what do we raise it? I go, my answer was all I'm saying is it needs to be a minimal 40% and Bobby's like, I think we should triple their price. I go, is that a minimal 40% because I go, is that a minimal 40% because it's way more than that. go, great. How much does it come out to be? It's like, it's 150 bucks. I go, I go, I like that better because then that sort of bakes in them being able to raise their price and us not having to, right? So, but I go, I always want to have a 40% profit margin on whatever we're doing. That's my target, right? We're not going for an agency 15. We're going for 40. just that's it, right? And then, so now. from that perspective, I was like, we can go revisit the pricing of the service from that vantage point. How do we say, how do we figure out what is the 40%, so it's not 40% now, it's that we're getting maybe it's 60 now, and we know that, hey, we're going to have to, this is going to happen, right? We're going to have to upgrade the server with Presidion. Well, that's a humongous price height. It's quadruple, but we won't be using all the resources, right? We're just going to absorb that cost. So you go from 800 to 3000, and I got, we've been avoiding it for months and months and months. like, no, we're not switching, because I'm not, I'm not eating that cost right now. So it would be like, okay, we have to factor in that. And then we have to factor in the Abish again, DJ, like I would factor in the doubling, right? And then, so where, how do we figure out that pricing that GPT will be? So that's, that's the last conversation I haven't thought about it on, I think it's 3-0 Friday. Except what I just said, I never said.
00:44:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's it right there. don't know if I can have it, but I'll.
00:44:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's okay. totally know what I just said.
00:44:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I did make most of the notes in here. So if you wanted to look at that. Yeah.
00:44:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, because my other argument was like, we have to be comparative to a good job or whatever, but we don't have to. Pop their price.
00:44:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can be higher than that. Well, yeah, because.
00:44:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's more than that. That's, this is a managed service. Yeah.
00:44:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is not managed. Right. Yeah. Yes, I'm just going to put this in here in your text or email or I'm just to send the link. I think that, I mean, it would be interesting to me to have a conversation with chat GPT about your scenarios where you can't get people on the same page with you about some of the text stuff and say, look, here's our scenario, here's the task, here's what these people said, this is their role, here's what this person said, so I'm checking BJ, this is what I said, this is what I suggested. I don't know if we could give it enough information to be able to help but. But anyway, the biggest thing is if you could come up with a, almost like a decision matrix for them to measure the logic and go, like, how did you come to that conclusion? What's the simplest way to do it, which maybe would be the decision point, right? little diamond, is it these options, whatever, which one is the simplest, whatever that type of thing?
00:46:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think the problem is that there is, like, we haven't defined, hey, these are the three landing pages, hey, these are the sales pages, right? They're defined only in design only, but they're not defined like, I mean, to be completely honest, they don't even exist in reality, right? They exist in that the blocks exist, so therefore you could make that layout, but we have never made the layout or used it, because the theme is irrelevant. So in the future, whatever sales page and checkout page reset you is using, I will get rid of it. It would be like, hey, put them on checkout page A or one or whatever the naming command becomes. And then there's no question, it's like, hey, they need a new funnel funnel one. Okay, great. knows what funnel is. funnel one is, what funnel one does, where funnel one lives. But right now there is no funnel one, right? Everything is, it's, there is no menu. The menu exists only in concept, but the menu does not exist in reality because the item on the menu also doesn't exist, but that should all be resolved come November, come October, asked Abishik for an update today, like, all right, Eric says we're on track with Frank. Are we on track with Frank? If we are on track, do you have an ETA for? the woofer site launch and he's asleep so I'll probably get that answer tomorrow. But I mean that's it, but that's literally D-Day. Or B-Day, basis day.
00:48:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Go B-Day.
00:48:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
D-Day's got the publications.
00:48:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to send that to you soon because I wasn't paying attention because I was talking to you. I'm just going to add this part into which is that you haven't defined the pages or the layouts and that that will help with the logic and the pricing.
00:48:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, the menu will be real, right? It'll be like it will be like you can have a picture, right? Here's what your burrito is going to look like.
00:48:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like a catalog with an actual image that you can have and here's the you know the item in the catalog.
00:48:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So yeah. Yeah, and then we'll be able to and that it will be in use, right? Fulfer will be using what would be check out page one and then sales page layout like the sales page layout is, you know, the copy that Maria and I did and the design is done and if the copies all in it, like, but it's been built how you I'm going to I'm started meeting with her this week, every day. I'm again.
00:49:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so.
00:49:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Every day. Yeah.
00:49:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So all 15 minutes a day. So I can just get a I'm talking to somebody who cares about what I'm doing. And so I get a little like accountability and. On the bill of body. Yes. Um, I think, I think, um, the, there's equal benefit to both of us, but the power I know of what I'm giving her is different. She already feels different. She's excited. She's on fire. she's, she's like, I should be so tired today. ate gluten and I went to sleep late. whatever she's like, but I'm energized. I'm like, that's what clarity does, baby. But yeah, so I think that I think that will be really good for me. But like one of the things we did today was I asked her basically her business origin story and she's amazing. Like she's done crazy things and she's probably a genius. And just really, um, I don't think she's always played small, but, but she, uh, again, I don't think I'm, I don't, by the way, telling people to have to think.
00:50:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, her and I went deep.
00:50:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't worry. So anyway, basically being married to a narcissist, rector, as it does to women, uh, get anybody. Yeah. But yeah. So anyway, I think that, um, she's just. and new seasons of life and everything else. But anyway, she's really, really smart. She just is not centered on anything. I'm trying to figure that out, but I think her heart is her center because she just loves business. both had paper routes and bought our first bikes with our paper route.
00:51:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Anyway, I didn't feel like you two have parallel vibes and almost parallel resumes. Because she was undercover behind the scenes on some largish stuff. But then ultimately, it didn't work out, right? Whether for whatever reasons, right? the business was F-ed up or the guy was F-ed up or whatever. And then she went sort of solo still undercover and she, like you, is very much resistant to it's bizarre. It's, I want to, but I don't want to do her own thing, right? So she's, so she's, she's putting her toe in and she's pulling her toe back out. And then she's like doing it. And, but it seems like it's inevitable.
00:52:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, he doubts herself very much. Yeah, which is weird because it's not how you deal with the narcissist for so long.
00:52:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, exactly.
00:52:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
she's got the result. You do crap.
00:52:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Cause somebody literally tells you that every day. Yeah. She's got the results. So it's like, that's the part that matters. Yeah. She's got the, the, the speak, she knows the language.
00:52:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She, she's very, she's data driven.
00:52:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Like, yeah, I mean, I'm dying to do something with her. just need a damn code.
00:52:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. We should do something with the three of us. You would balance us out. So good.
00:52:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh my gosh. Yeah. want to do mom and family with her period. Like, I'm going to, yeah, that's what I want to do with. I told her about it. She's like, oh my god that sounds like that sounds so cool and i'm like i already know how to generate the leads already you're i'm going to put them into that thing that i sent you that's my plan i'm like okay i can put them into this i will i'll use high level for the whole thing i was generating leads for less than two bucks on this one lead magnet i think i might change the lead magnet marks working on it i talked to them about it this week i just need to sort of revisit that stuff and go i need the code and then it would be like all right cool get all the design stuff pulled together you know most of it is and just make sure it's all looks right built right and then i don't want to run ads oh so you did that for sure i know i don't want to run ads but i want to be involved in the ads right it's like okay and then obviously be able to have someone this that gets data right and then i can and i feel like i can get her data no one else ever does yeah here we go like And then, but she's, she's, you know, all her little case studies are very dated through them. Yeah. That's how you do it. Yeah.
00:54:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
she gets it.
00:54:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Funnels successes math, blah, blah.
00:54:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're going like, yep. Yep. I'm like, that's, and I could keep her focused. So she doesn't sabotage and over stretch and do too many things. So there's any, any way to help there or just, I would just love to see her work with somebody.
00:54:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's good. I mean, it's literally my plan. I'm just waiting for the damn code and it's probably not going to happen until I realize it's probably not going to happen until January, but whatever. That's fine. New year, 2025.
00:54:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's go. She's awesome. I'm so excited to see what happens though when she, I don't know, I like liberating people and she is a person that was guarded and trapped. told her it's, it's, I saw the mask and I was like, I'm just going to tell you, I think you're guarded and you can't be like that with me. So I'm pushing and we'll see what happens, but she let me in.
00:55:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So anyway, yeah.
00:55:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
more smart women.
00:55:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm so excited.
00:55:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I wouldn't know about her without you either. So thank you, I had no idea.
00:55:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
She was her. She, she.
00:55:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Keep my interest. But you find her because you go down rabbit holes.
00:55:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. Hopefully.
00:55:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you for being a rabbit hole follower.
00:55:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. It was, she said something about writing coffee for women, I think. Or it was very into what I was doing with the chat GPT thing. The wolf or spreadsheet.
00:55:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:55:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Which we ended up using.
00:55:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
hard. Superized guys, any movement in that conversation.
00:55:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I never even wrote them back. just. don't see a path. And so I realized with you, right, where I was like, oh, we really need this. Right, right, right. I reached out to Hamza, wrote him a brief scope, saw that he read it on Upwork, hit him up again with my favorite, my favorite response. Yes, question mark, no question mark, maybe question mark. And he responded, and he was like, I would like to do this hourly because it's, you know, a bit of a moving target, whatever. And I said, that sounds great. Can you give me an estimate on the hours that would take you to create a beta that we only use internally? Does it mean a thing? I just need something that we can bang on. And he said, I will do that. And I will get back to you. think he said he would do it today. I am not really logged in off work yet today. So I'll check on that. He's 40 bucks an hour. He's as good as hired. Let's see. He comes back and says $400, which I seriously tell you So yeah, I think he's going to say, you know, 15, 20 hours, not even how do you know, we'll see.
00:57:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they'll be way cheaper than they and some of you that supervise things that they're going to get. Yeah, but then you'll be a competitor, guess what?
00:57:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And I'll be able to go back with them and say, hey, look, I just did this for $600, right? And the cost, I know the cost, I know I can figure out the cost for me to use their software and convert someone to an email. That's the only cost I care about, right? So for them to create a follower is 30 cents. I can do that with an ad. I can do it at a greater scale. So then the question is Can I turn the ads? What's the cost of turning an ad into a follower versus the super ice?
00:58:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's going to be super duper close and The way I do that is with potentially $1,000 What I'm just taking $1,000 out $1,000 ad Yeah, was like we don't spend it Which could still be all power flowing You know what I just realized It took me that when you were talking about lead flow you're like I've never been able to visualize all that it is like for me It was a system that and it took me forever to get here figuring out that it was your automations in high level But to me, but now I it's your high level account period Right that you call lead flowing Yeah, that's my white they don't dance. Yeah, I do not realize that. This is the thing without seeing the stuff when we talk about it conceptually and not screen share, I'm like, it takes me so much longer to wrap my head around it. Yeah, which is probably a useful conversation in when you struggle with having any conversations with Abhishek and Vijay, maybe doing more screen sharing as they're talking about things, just clicking on it, looking at it so that they can make the visual correlation between what's happening in your mind.
00:59:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, I don't know what I think the issue there is, you know, they were, they like, the information gets to them incorrectly. So basically, they based it off of literally what Ross wrote the ticket. But then they did another task that Frick rope, and I'm like, why is this a landing page? Like, is there a reason why you guys made this landing page that I'm not getting? Because it shouldn't be a landing page. And then, and then, so Eric screwed that up. And then I started to, I was like, oh, we should do XYZ. And then I sent that. And then the next day was like, wait a minute. I looked at the page, then even I got it. I looked at the page and I like, whoa. You know what, I didn't even talk to the SNO people. So, you know, when the information you're working off of is wrong, essentially, or, you know, sort of mis-scoped. But that version gets resolved by the menus. The one that I just brought up is just a one-off that, you know, we just, it just wasn't obvious looking at the design, what it was to any of us. Yeah. Then I went to Gert. And then even when Gert. Sabry wanted, I was like, how did he do that? This is custom. Okay, I know what it needs to be now. So they actually built it right. It's just now we have to decide it should not be on the page for a different reason, even though it works.
01:01:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Any updates on Mom? Just I got to get the book over to Katie.
01:01:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So Katie was waiting to close on her house, which they did over the weekend and they're moved in. Just sent a photo with her large cheeked baby. The baby's got like jowls. like, oh my god. So much cheeks. So now that there she's like, you know what, we just got to get that out of the way. So I got to dig that up, send it over to her with my thoughts. What I was thinking as far as this metaphor of the organization and then her and Jeff was like, We'll do it, or, you know, that her husband's name or something? Yeah, he's also an editor. So between the two of them and me, we should be able to get it. then Mark's like, I don't give a what you do with that. It's a great, because that's pretty much my plan. Not giving a about what you think. Sorry, buddy. Good job writing it. And then that to me is like the Maria project. It's like a book funnel. Or that's one of them. So like I imagine you could have a book funnel and then you could have the freebie funnel, which would be the cheat sheet, right? Which is going to be a release cheat sheet kind of thing. That's the new one that Mark's working on now. Before we used a royalty cheat sheet that worked, but I'm not sure it attracted the right avatar. But then again, we also didn't have a funnel to drive them through, right? Like I was just proving. step one, can I get a lead? could now buy that stupid snapshot probably today and then get moving on that. Oh, I guess I need to make a mom account or I don't think I have one. Now I have to move the mom account like I told you now I'm just move it. gonna move it between agencies and then I'll make the team account. I do have a bunch of leads in there.
01:03:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I now that the girls are back in school, I'm just like doing the best of doing things out and they're not around all the time. It's something about just hovering as a mom when the kids are home. I'm afraid to get into anything because I'm not even kidding you. The percentage is probably high 90s. Every time I sit down and I'm ready to be creative, the people I care about most want to talk. nobody wants to talk to me for hours then hours hours and so I'm just can't about it because they're not gonna be here forever so I just be like okay let it go and I feel like a slacker and I judge myself and I'm like I'm not but still like that's just my priority but anyway all right it's 110 10 and they're texting me and I probably should let you go yeah I'll give you one update this is gonna be great it's gonna be like the cliffhanger update and then we're gonna I'm gonna just hang up on you and there is informing Jamie today that she's out I need to save those notes so apparently there's a 60 day first write a refusal clause that she's gonna tell Jamie this exists FYI so you have 60 days and she's asking for 300 grand
01:05:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Which is not going to happen.
01:05:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, so then what does that mean?
01:05:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Then she can go sell it without Jimmy's input at all.
01:05:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's rough. Yeah. I am happy for Heather. I can't not feel bad for Jamie. No, what she did in it, but I don't. Wish, you know, there's so many things that go into how she behaves. And not everything is her fault. But even when we do do things and it is our fault, you still kind of got to feel bad. Because somewhere something, something went wrong and it's just. I'm glad for Heather moving on and maybe it'll help Jamie. I we all have to learn lessons and usually the hard way.
01:05:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
have to learn everything the hard way pretty much. Yeah. mean. I talked to Heather and I said, just be prepared for like, no one's going to buy this. I hate to break it to you. And then so I'm like, you should have a, you know, owner financed thing on the table. She's like, I don't trust Jamie to do that. I go, no, I know you control all the finances. So the owner finance would be, I'm taking 80% of the revenue until this number is met. And then I'm releasing it all to you. Period. And she's like, oh, that could be a plan B.
01:06:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, girl, that's your plan A. hate to break it down.
01:06:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It looks like it's a plan B, but it's really, yeah, yeah. You might want to add a bubble to the bottom of that A because it's a B.
01:06:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's man, business is like, parenthood too. Like you think it's going to be one thing and you build it to be one thing and it's never, but you think it's going to be no matter how hard you work it to be that way.
01:06:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no, And I was like do it. Yes. was like just do it right now And then we had a call together this morning and Jamie was so awful on the call.
01:07:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like oh my god What's she?
01:07:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What's that I was gonna ask what she did, but I'm not trying to be like oh it was just like she all out of nowhere Was saying well, I didn't get paid to do the gen pucks of videos last time and you know It's got a big deal, but this time I want to get paid and Heather's like you've never been paid to do those. Yes I have I think we're just both misremembering Heather's like no, Jamie Never happened. Yes. Well in December of 2022. So clearly she like Rose is narrowed over to her head I got a large check in December 2022 right before the gen tucks deal launched Heather said yeah That was a member distribution because we were flush with cash Nothing to do with generation that's not how I remember it and Heather's like yeah, but that's what it is. There's no record of you ever. So then Jamie there because Jen Tucks came back. And so first Jamie didn't want to do it because they have so many bad reviews. And it was like, you know, there's a moral aspect to this. And I was so ninja on the phone. And I was I can't wait. I was when I talked to Heather, like, you see what I did there? And by the end of the call, Jamie was like, Oh, yeah, let's do the videos. I'm like, you're so weird. And that but then I don't know where she brought up this thing where she should get paid as the talent to do the videos. And then Heather goes, I guess we'll just do the the version that doesn't happen. And then it was like, oops. And then I'm like, Oh, this is so over. That was after the show up on video. No, I don't know. I was on the phone.
01:08:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They might have been I could just imagine the faces on one of the calls with the two of them when they were going through stuff. And that was when Heather first started standing up to Jamie after we'd had some talks and I was like this is really glad I wasn't on video because I have no hope for me at all. Okay. Anyway. That's a terrible way to end a meeting on whatever. Go pet my dog.
01:09:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There you go. Me too. Let me go eat some food too.
01:09:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Perky.
01:09:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's good.
01:09:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. I am.
01:09:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
As matter of fact, exactly that.
01:09:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Seven years.
01:09:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I've learned a couple of things. Here we go. All right.

Hey, hey.
00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, What's going on? When did I need my name?
00:00:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because I'm sick. Sick has got the blood drawn yesterday morning and you're just having.
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, my daughter came home sick and she got. So I've got my inhaler and been taking my silver and I already feel better but I'm still like.
00:00:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Got it.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then this morning my daughter comes in and she's flashing light in the darkness in my eyeball. And I'm like and I never say Jesus Christ and I say Jesus Christ.
00:00:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry.
00:00:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, I thought she was talking about my daughter for a minute.
00:00:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It could be a dog.
00:00:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Dog. I walk out and I smell this god-awful smell. I'd never smelled before and The dog was filming at the mouth.
00:01:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like what's going on. I'm like it's got me a skunk But it didn't smell like a skunk, but it was filling up my whole house the smell Oh God.
00:01:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it smelled like chemically and Not like a skunk, but it had to have been just a weird skunk We've had these experiences before it did permeate through the whole house if my daughter Mm-hmm up just smelling her dog. Yeah, she got sprayed right in the mouth dog So that's how I woke up and it wasn't even seven o'clock yet in the morning Yeah, so that on top of being sick and we had like body aches in my just yeah But and I feel good enough I get the job done, so Walk up and did my missionary stuff and I snuck like a shower during one of the calls because we're not on video and I muted myself and I'm like I'm just gonna listen and get my shower and right after I got out they like had a question for me so I'm like nobody knows and it's okay so so what did you do with the dog then what's happening with the dog right now she's okay okay yeah she it just had happened so she hadn't processed it and body but she had some water and she was too a lot just making that face and she's okay and I couldn't believe how much this because we have medical grade at HEPA filters throughout the house since COVID but also we all have asthma and the pollen around here is insane yeah so it did a really good job of clearing out smell pretty well and I can't believe it. leave because I prayed. I'm pretty sure miracles are just happening because the oils in the skunk are just they're pervasive. They take a long time to dissipate and go away. She didn't get a bath or anything but it's yeah it's the worst and the best skunk experience we've ever had. Worst as in how bad it was but best isn't how quickly it's it's like we still smell it but anyway she's okay she's out barking her head off right now. Oh my gosh and you're on fire yeah your pad just being like breaking it down. I watched while I was on my training for a minute because there were some because there was the board so I was like that's awesome.
00:03:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah yeah no yeah yeah I'm excited and I had a really good call this guy yesterday that's potentially more like just for me on the off offer stuff because he had a funnel builder that was doing stuff for him and that funnel builder just changes business model to not have any customers anymore and he's just gonna focus on his own offers. So he was wondering if I could take over and run ads for him and all that jazz. So I'm like, okay, cool. Yeah, let's do it. So yeah, that's kind of what's happening now is is to later on today, I told him said I want him to think I was a what do you go? Desperate of this that so he asked if I could send him just a detailed either a contract or or send him a details of what's more out of scope. That's what he'd like to learn more about. Not what's in scope. was going and so 5,000 months didn't phase him at all. So let's do it for 90 days, but obviously if you don't like it or you're You don't like it, you know, whatever, like I'm not going to hold you to the 90s, but I feel we should have that at least, but you got legs like I looked at his funnel. He just needs to optimize it. And I think it'll rock for him. And I also believe I don't know if you're like this now to I don't believe high ticket sells so well in this economy. So he needs in the real estate niche. He's a realtor. He's very successful what he does. And he's got a great book.
00:05:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think he wants to become like the next brand new chart, which I think is really cool. I don't it's the economy.
00:05:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I want to talk after that. Okay, sure. Okay, yeah, yeah, we love to talk. This is that is a podcast episode or video for us to do. So, but yeah, so he's trying to send them into a $3,500 thing. And I said, you know, honestly, if I run your shoes, I really feel you should have more 500 or 900 or 300 thing to assemble too. And I think that's going to make you 50k months easily with this funnel because the real estate niche have been in it. I'm very experienced and I even how I was there when Chris Michore just started because I was with the ad agency So, you know, saw her when she was nobody and everybody knows who she is, but she started in real estate now She teaches all things business, but uh, so anyways, um, yeah He's certainly open to that because I really feel You're setting yourself up for fail failure because then you have a sales team then you gotta deal with this and he doesn't want that He makes good money in his real estate business.
00:06:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He doesn't want to deal with that or manage people.
00:06:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So anyways Um, he's Looked like he's a yes. Uh, yeah yesterday on the phone. He and he on zoom call We energetic are really aligned the Ford for his book was written by one of his friends who's Bob Berg of the go-giver So like he's very heart centered Um, person so um, anyways, I understand he just wants to know what's in scope. What's not in scope Is it okay? I'll just craft you I told him I'd do it tomorrow, is today So once I have that then that will alleviate a lot of pressure to have five thousand Coming in for that, plus he's a fun guy to work with.
00:07:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I thought as soon as you said the price point, and for 90 days I'm like, okay, that just created the space that you need it. But it's actually because, but what you also need is you need the boon of what's been, what you've been having to deal with is the energy of it. wouldn't say it started with Carina, but it definitely maybe was probably most noticeable and painful with Carina of not being respected. That is an emotional heart pain, and you had Rudy, and I'm coming from these kinds of experiences as well. I'm speaking because I know what they feel like to not be honored, especially when you show up and give everything.
00:07:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, yeah, let me turn my box around. And this is to have some
00:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
but nickel and dime you.
00:08:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, try to be miserly with you.
00:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But say, I see your expertise at that price makes sense to me, at least like it isn't a done deal yet. But yeah, once you start dealing with people who honor you, you are your energy is completely different. You're not coming from a defensive and making space and now your creativity flows.
00:08:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Also your generosity increases because your fear can diminish because you know that there are good people out there.
00:08:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's very cathartic and releasing and powerful. But when you're already a generous person, it actually increases your generosity because somebody kind of restored your faith and humanity a little bit, you know. But something to think about. So in terms of the economy, there is just as much money as there always has been. If not more, it has shifted. There's a greater priority, but the bigger issue. is the economy of trust. The trust economy has what's been most damaged. So there are too many people stealing and promising big things. And hey, I'm so and so, and you just get my time. You get access to me, you get access to my community.
00:09:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's worth $10,000, it's not.
00:09:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need results for $10,000. So and most of these things are just, here let me throw all of this information at you, but there are a lot of gaps. It's not actionable. There, there isn't a support system where you can ask a specific question where you need to get. So for most people, they have realized, so this is the trust part, it's part of the trust is that they need, if they're going to spend that much money, it needs to get them a certain level of results. They're really, like people didn't ask this question. and have this realization that they're giving to you this week, which is I need an implementer because they realize they're not the one. So people that used to throw money away and the whole just kind of energy that you could do this throw money away and you would get something out of it doesn't exist anymore. There's a whole new market, but the market is coming in more educated realizing I can't just give five or ten thousand dollars and my life is going to change. So that's the big issue. can't there will be people who will pay money just for access, right? that's one thing that's my guy who's always told people people will pay for access and that's true. They will pay a lot of money to get into somebody's world. But that's not everybody. That's a small person and that person already knows what the value and the benefit of being in
00:11:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
in that connection is, right?
00:11:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the results, they've already calculated, they've already done that. Everybody else, which is the majority of the people need to have a tactical result, which is this thing that I can't talk myself into building, or I can't even comprehend how to build front like backwards and forwards, where I can build, but I don't know how to mark it, where I can mark it, but I don't know how to build that kind of thing that there's always one of those gaps, right? Yep. They need to have that solved. So for the person selling something, the person selling has to decide what do I want to deal with, okay? So we already know what we want to give and what we can sell and what we can offer, but there's a burden involved in fulfillment. So if the thing is we want to help realtors be better realtors. I want to help realtors be better realtors, but I just want to share with them what I know. I don't want to deal with customers. support. I don't want to deal with one on one calls. I don't want to deal with live events, right? So then you get a lower ticket thing that just says, here's what you can learn, okay? I just created a material for you. I don't have a lot to deal with it, so I'm going to give it kind of inexpensive, but I can give it over and over and over again because I know how valuable it is. So that person, you know, your guy who doesn't want to do a lot might consider that. The other thing he can consider is bringing in so maybe you create community and then you're looking for the excited kind of go-getters or the experienced person and then you deputize them and go, hey, would you be interested in being a moderator? Would you be interested in being a junior coach or whatever? And so now they build into the model, you take somebody that you acquired through the funnel to begin with to be a leader and those leaders, they're different because they're also loyal now. not like you went out and hired somebody. They found you, they already been sold and converted and they drank the Kool-Aid. So they're ideal to support your community and now you can charge a higher tier because now you can offer support but you're not doing it. You're facilitating it, you're paying for it, you've created a system that brings the leaders in, you create a system that can train the leaders so you can train your trainers but you don't actually do it. So he could be working with some high level people on occasion which helps him keep his saw sharp and just you know keeps tucked into his business and so like if the market ever just crashes he's got this other thing over here. love the market crashes he's not going to be a selling that very well. But anyway something to consider about that but I don't think so the economy is definitely bad but it's really mostly bad for people who struggle to get jobs in the first place. who, so for entrepreneurs if they're targeting broke people That was already an issue, which is Karina.
00:14:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And that's why her business. So I had put the glasses on and I prevent ice cream. Yeah, I really feel that sort of Karina in a way happened to her with her list. And that's why. Yeah, because they just weren't responding anymore. Like it was hard to get sales from the compared to a year ago. Same emails, right? So, yeah.
00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so that target matters. the people, but everything flows uphill, right? So, food chain. So if these entrepreneurs were targeting the rogue people who barely had money to begin with, who were just thrown it out because they couldn't, they're not getting paid. So these people that used to pay these people, these people aren't getting as much money. some of these people are creative and pivoting. So some of these people are getting that money. But these up here, you know, they're like having different conversations and pivoting more. So the majority of the shortage is here. The next level is here. The next level is here and so on. So the money and the money is flowing up, the shortage, but it's still there, it's still being generated and it's still being spent, it is the difference of who's targeting whom. Are you targeting people that have money or are you adjusting your offer to make it more available to them? But in addition to that, are you shifting what you're offering and support so that if you reduce your revenue, you're also reducing your burden, right? So maybe I'm still helping you, but I'm not giving you the one-on-one hand holding, because this price point doesn't allow me to do that, but I still want to lift you up and help you. Yeah.
00:15:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that make sense?
00:15:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, that's my feeling about how it's going, because there's still a lot of people just throwing money just going, yeah, no problem.
00:15:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let's go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I've evidenced by the sudden guy reached out to me, he sold his
00:16:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
company after the harmoses and so he wants to start a new funnel in the fertility nation wondering if I can help with that and they said yeah sure uh so you know we're just uh I should need to get back to them too so after we finish this call I need to go back to these people that are hanging loops what do you call it unfinished loops I would be happy to help you create your really clear and don't don't create the potential for scope creep because I don't want to see you be stressed out for your own reasons but for my selfish reasons too because then if you're stressed out then I don't get to play against myself yeah yeah yeah how must you do you mind if we a you You
00:20:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You Back hey, oh my god. She's painting the like she bugs me for food I gave her her food and then she walks away from her nose turned up Yeah, yeah Cuz she wants I put sometimes put a little bit of sliced ham on it, but I'm not gonna do that every single meal for her So she didn't like that. Yeah, she didn't eat it at lunch at two hours ago So I picked up put it back in the fridge with those cuz the wet food and expensive. It's like $4.50 for a little can of this cat food and she goes through a can of day and plus her dry food and so she turns and knows about it and so I put in the fridge and then now she was bugging me bugging me for food and so I put it back down on her when I was making my coffee and she looks at me and walks away.
00:21:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's hilarious. Is it too much cheaper than that?
00:21:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um you know it some of it is special ones on sale um that is Canadian dollars so 450 is probably 350 US or excuse me um but um I have given her tuna sometimes too but I guess with the special product a more holistic brand it has kind of more in it but the problem is she likes chicken flavored and Merlin the burnadoodles are allergic to chicken so if he gets in the cat food that's why he lifted he then gets the runs like the night two nights ago I was up three times during the night because he kept pawing at me go outside so you know it's not nearly as much of the painting you had this morning food.
00:21:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah and then I had to change their dog food um It's always like throwing up or dragging their butts across the ground and there's a lot of stuff outside that they can get into so I don't really know what's what but I was reading how much corn is in all the dog food and how bad it is to digest for any any of us really but so I got some food from Chewy that doesn't have any corn in it and they've been a lot better but yeah I can't see no little fur babies got to take care of them I know I know they are beautiful like oh no she's eating her wet her dry food so she said no to the wet food that's really expensive and the dry food is expensive nowadays too but anyways now she's stomping at that oh my god anyway um yeah so did you see my video that I did on my facebook page today I saw part of it I didn't get to see all of it but I thought that was awesome yeah and who I'm calling out now 50,000 And I'm embedding the seed, right?
00:23:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
yeah, if I come over here, so, yeah, 50k months from different parts, I'm just kind of embedding the seed. So, so, yeah, yep. All right, so I got this going. Let's go. You cool to start on this now or is that.
00:23:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, let's do it. So, I think the fastest way to start would be what do you already know that he wants to do so that what is the existing goal? Actually, that would be that's what I do is I reverse engineer every single time. What is the outcome that is desired? And then I work backwards and think about what has to happen to make that. And then I figure out what is the simplest way to accomplish that and what are the guardrails to make sure that I'm not. called out of it. If there's potentially something that could scope creep, I build that in and say, okay, if this needs to happen, you will pay for this. Maybe I'll manage it. Maybe I'll lead it, whatever. But just to be clear, if this is needed, I'm not doing it.
00:24:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. So he's got a couple outcomes desired. I'll just write them all down and then we can succinctly make it better if you want. So so the first thing is that the overall big outcome is that his avatar of and obviously this isn't going to go in a minute like this of who he wants to become is like a Brooke Castillo.
00:24:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you know Brooke Castillo? No.
00:24:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. She is the owner of owner of the life. Basically he wants to become a high-performance coach like a Tony Robbins Brooke Castillo. Okay. Or Brandon Bouchard, right? owner of life. So he wants to use the real estate RE course as a springboard to other other missions. don't know what you want to call it, but EG, he has a productivity course course. I think he'd love to have a relationship course. This is down the road like he'd like to just help people, right? His offer is called, his name's Grant Mueller.
00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know ever heard of him. He sounds very all over the board.
00:25:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, no, no. This is for long term. No, I could just go into the short term. Why call me? just you know that it's good, but it does help to have the overall thing. Yeah. So, I mean, the initial scope is basically optimizing this funnel. Also, he'd like to get to let me find the actual URL top of that yeah top of heart offer and this is converting not bad it's at 7% conversion so it actually isn't bad um he showed me the conversions but uh top of hearts he booked Bob Berg's written the four that's his friend as well but um you know as far as uh you know if we were just to go down to the real outcomes that he wants to um make a profit with this uh little ticket funnel funnel and that's called top of heart offer make a problem that's um he also said that it'd be he says i can afford the 5k right now no problem but it's coming out of my real estate business but i'd like your 5k month to be funded from this event as well. But basically, I think you'd like to get to 20k profit per month. I need to say an exact number. He kind of just said he wants to make it profitable. So let's just get rid of this.
00:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it currently like, does it lose money?
00:27:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What is that? Yeah, so the history is he hired this other guy, Vinny, to create the funnel like two, three months ago and run ads. And so the deal he had with him is that he charged in 10,000 to build the funnel and doesn't include up so one or upsell two, which is kind of like my little ticket offer. But he also runs ad for it. And because he knew that he had a $3,500 high ticket, he said, when you make your $10,000 back in sales of your high ticket, then I'll charge you $5,000 a month for continuing run ads and optimize the funnel. So Vince, a few weeks ago, decided to stop doing being an agency, um, you stopped everything. And he still likes Vince. He says, a good guy, but I have no one now, right? So the goal is to make it profitable. So he didn't really have the greatest numbers right now. And he was embarrassed about it, but said, I kind of need to know your numbers. He shared screen yesterday into his go ahead level account. That's why I knew he was converting at two at 7%. But no, he's, I don't know if he's profitable. I say no, because his average order value is probably only between seven and $10 because he had zero conversions of his order bump and zero conversions of up cell one. So I said, okay, right there, I know I can help you tremendously. So I already know you're under water because you're probably paying at least $40 cost per purchase. But I didn't want he was going to give me access to account. But I said, no, until we have a working relationship, I don't want to work, like expand my brain energy on that. But I know I can help you.
00:28:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how where is his current lead to coming from?
00:28:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's a new funnel. So paid traffic, Facebook ads.
00:29:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And what's, what's he paying? What's he getting? How many eyeballs are seeing it?
00:29:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, I don't know.
00:29:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I mean. I didn't want to look at his eyes. Okay. Okay.
00:29:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You don't know about it. Yeah. Yeah. Um, basically in the last, like, I think Monty had like 29 buyers. oh, he said he was spending 15, uh, I guess Vinny's deal with he does with people. He was spending 15, uh, $50 a day. And he's been running it for about six weeks. He said, these are all like, what happened, which I thought was kind of . But I'm not going to go into detail, slam, anyone or anything. But, um, because there's always two stories to it. Um, there was a slack channel that Vinny had with his clients that had all these numbers on it. And, uh, Vinny closed the slack account down. So, all that was gone. But still, that's up to him as the entrepreneur that he should have had a Google Sheet that showed weekly ad spend weekly So he also didn't know what he doesn't know, but he really, ideally the outcome is make this profitable, use it as a once he kind of feels he has it dialed in and knows doing like maybe launch other low ticket offers. Right now it's, you know, $7 offer. And he's got a lot of bombs and all that that I'd have to totally redo because they're not working. To a $3,500. I take it. Take it with more coaching. So, so the outcome desired is simply. Yeah, make a profit with the little take a funnel right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that that includes paying for me but I'm not going to say that in the document here. Oh, yeah.
00:30:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
let's do some quick math. which I shouldn't, I mean, basically, 5,000, 100 hours, hold on, let me do that. I thought, no, that's right. So roughly, if we were going to keep your EHR at 500, we'll, we'll make it 250, because 250 is still better than you've been doing, right? if you worked 20 hours a month for roughly five hours a week, that's roughly an hour a day. So that's I'm not saying that that's what you should do. And I don't think that you're necessarily in a situation to do that. I think you can do much better. And I think that even if you spend two hours a day for him every day, which would be 10 hours a week, which would make your effective hourly rate about $50, hold on a second, that's 5 out of 40, $125 an hour. So if you worked two hours a day, every pre-day of the week, your EHR would be about $125 an hour, which is still not bad. And I think that this is a process that you should do on a regular basis, just to kind of have an idea before you say yes, no to anything, whatever.
00:32:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And also it helps create the kind of scope.
00:32:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
in the two hours a day, there's a lot that you could do. There's a lot of research, there's a lot of copywriting, there's reporting time, there's all kinds of things that would go into. One of the things I always do for my clients, which very few people do for them, is I set up something for them and then make them owners. So I used to use base camp. Now I'm using Trello because base camp is more expensive and it's more convoluted than it used to be. And Trello is still very simple. It's just camben boards and I can invite them and then I can make them owner, where you can't do that with base camp. You can't somebody to an admin owner whatever. But that way, because you want to teach them, and this is a gift that you're giving them. to own their reporting, own their data, own their stuff, no matter who they work for. So a lot of people, and this is again kind of my leadership style and what I give to them is I teach them, delegate, don't abdicate, but most people abdicate. They say, they think, I give you my money, this is your responsibility now, no, because they don't care about your business like you do, they don't, you know, all that, anyway. So, so keeping all of these in mind, one of the things I would do is, let's say, and I would write this down, and I can, I can take some bottom notes too, but I would start with one of the things I'm going to do for you is create a project management suite there. So it's going to be a Trello board where we're going to track all of the things that are going to get done, and I'm going to task by everything so that you will be able to see what I'm doing, when it's due, or whatever is doing, if we end up hiring somebody to do something, and you will be be able to see everything that happens as it happens and you'll have a record of it moving forward. So if you want to duplicate this across another one of your products, you'll have the project mapped out that you could find what's usable and duplicated to the next one. So this is an asset I'm creating for you that you'll be able to use again and again. Because now you're value-stacking, right? not like I'm just not just getting you the money that you want. I'm creating assets and value that are going to have compounding benefits for you. But the other part of that is now you've got something that shows your work and keeps people from breathing down your neck. Well yeah but Maria didn't get me the results, I didn't get the sales, I wanted whatever. Okay well you can see Maria strategically went down through the list and your offer still didn't convert. know that because you can't make everything convert well whatever. There's a lot that goes into that. Anyway, so the next thing I would do, but I would have done this before coming into it since your job is conversion, I would have looked at the ads. And I would have looked at the ad account because just even though you know the conversion rate, you don't know how bad or good the ads are. Like if they're really good ads and he's spending $50 a day and can only get that, that's a red flag, that's an issue, that means you're going to have an uphill battle.
00:35:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, because because he doesn't have his funnel done, it's only front end funnel at seven bucks.
00:35:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yes, so that's an additional part, but if you have a hard time getting even front end sales with $50 a day, then that would be a concern that I would have, but if it was a really good ad, I doubt that that's the case, but I would have wanted at least that much information before I said yes for sure, like, at least show me one of your ads, so I know and look at it and go, yeah. There's so much opportunity.
00:36:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, he was willing to put me on the ad account, but I just, and also I've worked with him before.
00:36:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He is good at ads. almost hired him a while ago for a client for ads.
00:36:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like he's, so no, I think the ads are performing because for him to get seven percent conversion on 50 bucks a day on the fact that the funnel doesn't have any conversions on the order and no conversion upsell one. Like to me, there's so much opportunity there and just optimizing the funnel.
00:36:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, if you did one of your calculators and put in two order bumps, like, um, just next level, right? Do you, so you'd have to know what does he have that he could give in between an offer, um, between the seven and the 3500?
00:36:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Is there anything that he sells? Yeah, that's my job to figure out because he does have stuff and he gave me access to his whole drive to look at it. I said, look, we just need to create for you like a 297 product or a thousand dollar product.
00:36:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much did that, would you, have to do.
00:37:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, I don't have to create it, but what I'll do is probably will take me only hour to look at all of his existing assets, because he even said, honestly, Maria, Vinny had me create three bonuses for this similar product. And one of these bonuses, I think, could be the $297 if I just flush it out more. Nice. So yeah, it's kind of like what I did with Crena. Like, Crena had that $20 funnel, $50 average order value working with me. I increased to like $105 or more average order value. And instead of sending people to her $4,800 thing, I said, we just need to create a $1000 product. Oh, you're, she already had it. She already had it. So I said, we just need to create a decent enough sales page for it. Here's your VSL script for it. I outsourced the power graphics for it. And we also created the payment plan or 12 for 99, 12 months, and people stay in several months, and she's going to get 15%.
00:37:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, your most of your work is getting to done in the beginning. One thing I would require is a 90 day contract because you're going to spend most of your time in the beginning and not in that end. And so you kind of get cheated. And that's the thing that I would say is, okay, 5000 a month, this is a target, but it has to be a 90 day. And I would tell him because I'm going to work extra hard in the beginning. And so if you cut me out of because you're going to have to do the research, do the strategy, write the copy, create the ads, do the targeting, manage the ads, tweak the copy and the ads, according to whatever happens, create the nurturing sequence or the ascension or any of any of the follow up sequence. is in order to get people from opt-in to buying and then buying to upsell and so on until they've exhausted all of that. You know you're going to look at his email deliverability because you're not going to want him using email and then you're not touching it. I imagine you would anyway, I can't imagine you're not taking a peek at that and making a suggestion, right? So your mental energy is going there. there's probably going to be some graphics that need to be created in order to support the ad campaign, the landing pages, things like that. And the sequences, now we're talking about automations to an extent. It may be minor and it may be just people consider that part of the job, but it's still your knowledge and expertise.
00:39:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is a lot that's happening.
00:39:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So technically you're doing like three people's jobs. So well, four. So the media buyer, the copywriter, the graphic designer, and the automation expert, those are for roles that if you have a decent team, you're going to have those four roles are going to be different people, and you're doing all of it. So the other thing that you might build in is say, okay, if I get you to X point, then I get a performance bonus. And I will have earned it.
00:40:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Right. I know my friend Kira, and she's this is how she dealt with student McLaren and another gal that she's now running huge ads for the dinner clients for three years. She started out at 2500 a month plus 10% of ads. And now she's at, I think, 3000 month, the 10% of ads, but she makes 30,000 month for me client. because she grew, she's so good at what she does. Actually, I trained her that, um, you know, she, she got them to be able to profitably scale ads.
00:41:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you need to include that in your pedigree. Yeah, I'm in the notes.
00:41:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What's her name? Cara. Sure.
00:41:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She probably wouldn't want she. No, no, you don't have to tell her name. Yeah, I was gonna say her name. No, I don't like telling people's names. I, I'm not going to do that in myself. I'll describe the company because it just feels not good. You know, I don't want people talking about my business. My business is my business and I don't do other people. Um, but, but I want you to tell that story. So Cara, I'm going to put this in a highlight as a task that add that to your thing that you train somebody that does this. Like that's part of your pedigree.
00:41:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, there's a few, Kimmy is the same. She's making a killing and she was my practice for a few years.
00:41:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. but does she do all of these things that you would be doing or does she?
00:41:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, she, she, she, She just does the ads because these people have a team, Stu McClellan has a copywriter, he has a copywriter, but what I could do, I could tell them the graphics design cost is out of scope. I could say I know what I want from the graphic design, but I could say that's out of scope, that the cost of outsourcing graphic design elements. And it's not going to be much, but still, know, it could be 100 to 200, don't you think I figure, right?
00:42:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. It depends on what you need. if you're creating, if you're creating a pretty PDF, that takes a lot more time and energy, even for one of my Filipinos, like I might pay $100 just for that, just for the PDF. But then to get the 3D images and what might be $25. So those parts are not that expensive. But when you, when you are creating a new e-book, the PDF itself targets, it's expensive. So the graphics, not so bad. content that needs to be beautified. That's a little bit more expensive.
00:43:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Beautiful. Yeah, because the book's not really beautified.
00:43:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, but in the presentation matters. Like if I give you a piece of chocolate cake, have I told you this example before? No, tell me.
00:43:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If I give you a brand new company, Tina, I'll talk to you girl.
00:43:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I actually learned this in terms about presenting the gospel.
00:43:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It was funny, but it has universal applications.
00:43:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Presentation matters. So if you see me go cut a slice of a beautiful bakery cake, and I put it on a lovely elegant plate and hand it to you with a fork and a napkin, you know, that's one presentation. Now if I throw it on a paper plate, give it to you with a plastic fork. That's another level, but it feels a little bit different. It feels more elegant when you give it to me with all of that, you know, and it feels special. And but then if you give it to me on a paper plate with a fork, I'm just like, it's delicious, dig in, you know, I'm still here. Now, if you scoop it out with your hand and you put it in my hand, I'm like, I don't think I want it. And if you take tape cake and you throw it on the floor and then you pick it up and give it to me, I'm like, you crazy, go away. Right. it's the same. If you eat it other than the dirty part, it's the same, but how you present it matters. So our content, especially when you're talking about like ADHD, executive dysfunction, and also just depression and anxiety, based on color psychology, we know that colors have energy and they evoke emotion. So if you've just got a plain ugly thing, the emotion, you're not, you're not optimizing the emotion. But if you can create it in colors that create warmth and trust, so like blues and yellows and greens and oranges, that's why. If you look at the biggest brands, almost all of them use blue. Look everywhere. Any kind of thing. There is blue. Google uses it. You go look in your bathroom, go look at the biggest brand names that you buy. There is blue all over them. Because blue is trust. So green is travel, oranges, action, black is luxury, red is luxury also. But anyway, all these kinds of things, yellow is calming, but also trust. blue and yellow are used a lot. Anyway, but then if you like, if you have large chunks of text and it's small text versus the parallax type of design, right, and images. broken up through here so that the eye flows left to right and it's not glorious because or let's say they want to go back to a piece of content and they lost their place for a second and now they got to go through this chunk of text but but that chunk of text they wanted was right next to this particular image and they can find it easy. Most people aren't thinking about this the mental effort that people have to go through to consume their content. Yeah this makes a big impact because how can they be raving fans if they never consumed your stuff. So anyway this is something that again you you can just bring to the mix and you make beautiful images and you do this naturally but most people don't.
00:46:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know it's true whenever I've hired someone to help with graphic design Tina I'm just like oh you really suck at colors.
00:46:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can do this better.
00:46:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah like like like that's what I'd say to people like Sally lover and she's been a client of mine for for 15 years in customer mind. Cara, by the way, too, she was one of my first testimonials 10, 12 years ago. you know, now she's doing rocking, rocking it. yeah, when they put stuff together, I'm just like, oh, that's like, come on, girl, let's fix this up.
00:47:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have so much to bring to the table.
00:47:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry. I know, I know I'm excited about that. So, so, yeah, okay. So, so, so I've got a lot in here. This is a lot of stuff in here. Um, do you want to just want to lock it down?
00:47:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am here for whatever and you can tap me down. I get excited about everything. I'm the same way in Sunday school.
00:47:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So you can just be like, Tino can wait.
00:47:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, should I include the longterm outcome or no, that you said, I do. So, but I break things up and stages. So I'll give the full vision because I want them to see that I can see this and I want to get excited about it. And if I like working with them, I want to stay with them. So I'm going to draw the whole picture out. But I won't scare them with a commitment of, you know, you don't have to we don't have to do all that together. I can start with just this, but I want you to see that this is what I see that we could be working on.
00:48:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, so, so how do I quantify or say the full vision? just said, you know, Brooke is there. So yeah, actually I'm like coach certified by her lover. And I think she scaled too fast, though. And I know she's having some issues. But he said that that's I just love her thought model. I love what she does for people, helping them be better you and stuff. And that's what I eventually want to be in. He has, I noticed in some of this stuff in his book that I started reading, he has talked about high performance like himself. This is his first email that sucks, by the way, but this is the book. And you're right, the, the, the, this is not bad top of heart. I got my attention, I saw that. But he definitely is kind of talking about himself as more of a peak performance person, how to approach your business, save my life. I think I save yours too. We talked about how he almost died because he was a mathematics and a dealer. So I've only read the first quarter of it last night and it was interesting. It did hook me. But yeah, I think he could make this better. This is because I think it was on Amazon. think it's kind of like this because it was a written book as well.
00:49:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, what I would do too and what I want to do with everybody that I work with where I'm any kind of operator is I need to know what the values are but I need to know the overarching value. What is the most important thing? So why does he want to be like Tony Robbins? Does he want to be hero worshiped or does he want to help as many people as he can? Now, he's not going to tell you he wants to be hero worship. Your job is to pay attention then to figure out if he's congruent or not. And here's what you need to understand also if he was a meth addict, he has an addictive personality. Addicted personality means he needs that dopamine hit and he can get that from hero worship. So those are red flags that you have to watch out for is that they need a drug and that can get in the way and that can cause them to sabotage business. So you don't have to fix all that you just need to be aware of it and so but but what you can start with so look at that and you know there's love that he is feeding off the energy that is his drug and it's okay because we all have our stuff but you just you just want to know that you understand why he's all over the but board is because he's chasing dopamine he's chasing his hit. So if you can in managing the business provide the hits. right? Then then he's going to be happy. Whether he can speak it or not, what he needs is to feel feel that that energy coming back to him. So if we could go back to your document?
00:51:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yep. I just lay that down chasing dopamine.
00:51:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:51:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All right. There it is.
00:51:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. So, um, there is like, what did Tony Robbins do before he became Tony Robbins? then the Tony Robbins we know now is not the Tony Robbins we knew 10 years ago, 20 years ago, whatever. Now he's doing stuff with his wife and leading women. And so one of the things you want to do is put things in perspective as to where he has now, where he was five years ago, where he wants to be. And to know that there is a pace that you can influence.
00:51:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
if you try to force it, you're going to break things.
00:51:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So this is why I talk about sustain up growth. And people that are that have addictive personalities, which I would say that I do, but I've worked on that a long time and didn't very conscious of it. So I didn't make me get a crowding it.
00:52:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Was that me too probably as well?
00:52:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:52:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that me?
00:52:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
kind of lost my train of thought. But anyway, it was that they'll sabotage things by if they're not filling what they need to do. So you kind of need to help crowd them. And so chunking things out so full vision is just kind of building out what the process is. So we could say, okay, you're here. Here's where you want to be, you know, Tony Robbins level. So one of the things that I would ask him, which is way beyond the scope of support, but it will help you knock this out of the park. If you want to. Um, would be, what is it about Tony Robbins and Brooke that you specifically want to have? Is there anything about them that you're not interested in having in their business? And I would describe, I would have them describe, you know, what does that day look like? does that, that year look like the year in the life of, um, grants?
00:53:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, Tony, do me ask him that messenger right now?
00:53:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not yet. I'll send you these notes so you can go do that later. Um, so then you could say, all right. Well, we know that we can't get there by the end of this year, but maybe we could get there in the end of five years. But in the meantime, you need this to be profitable. And then you want to build out the next offer and the next offer, right? So, we would say the first, you know, six to nine months, our job is to build out, um, is to optimize. This particular offer and do it so well that when you get to creating the next offer that we've got the system down and we can basically replicate it for your next offer. So you're priming him to and that's in a sum to close. We're going to be working together nine months from now. If you want it, right? And that's not manipulation. It's just what I've noticed after the fact. I always operated like that. And then somebody told me, I like your sons of clothes. I'm like, what? What is that? I didn't know. It wasn't a technique. It was just me being me.
00:54:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was just like, well, of course, like, why would I not think about it that way?
00:54:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So basically six, nine months build out this offer to profits and do it so well, we'll replicate it for other niches you mentioned productivity relationships. Yes, but immediately after you say that, you're going go now, don't think that I mean it's going to take nine months to profit. I mean that we've matured it to the point that we can now replicate it to the next product. So now you break out the timeline for making this profitable. So me knowing you, I think within the next 30 days, you will have mapped out two order bumps, created the sales pages, landing pages, and ads, whatever necessary for those order bumps.
00:55:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
One order bump and then optimize, just because I don't know if go high level has the ability to order bumps.
00:55:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't want to get into technology. Okay. So, yeah, that's a technical language as to how it works, but you know what I mean? think is really what we call it differently. order bump, cell one, there we go, which I always think is not about just dropping the price. Hey, if you didn't like it, that price, here's another one, because that sounds out of integrity. But if you didn't like that, here's a smaller version of it at a lower price. Anyway, so in 30 days, all of that should be mapped out and live. Now, they might balk and think that that's not fast enough. But there's a lot that goes into getting that done correctly. And he's going to have to create more ourselves. So we want to make sure that that happens. 30 to 60 days, then, from day 30 to day 60, is we're observing and potentially, by the way, at the end of 30 days, also having a split test mapped out for headlines or call to action or price, but not all of the above for each of the things that we have going on. So one split test. for every landing page mapped out an on deck for live by the end of 30 days. That's a total agency because everything you're telling me now if I had you five years ago we'd be 50 million a year. I did actually and incredibly fast. It's Arthur Tubman and yeah and and then he ruined it by overselling and pissed me off and I quit and then he got a divorce and yeah and he was also a drug addict. Got it. Recovering. Yeah I do know what I'm doing actually. Yeah I'm scaling agencies but but I also know they're the biggest reason I have most of the guardrails I have is because this is a very difficult model and the clients that you take are make or break because most of them are high pressure and if you get these people who have these arbitrary goals and they're They throw a ton of money at an agency and the agency says yes when they shouldn't have because the client was out of integrity Trying to 10x and it just destroys everybody along the way And yeah, okay, so can we scroll back down when you're when you're ready? Okay, so matter of fact, I have phases mapped out I don't even remember what they are, but I know what I would make and I have all these phases for growing the agency But day 30 to 60 is just monitoring optimization and it's more split testing Split testing the abs again headlines call to action and images Sometimes price point kind of just depends on what's happening but Um The thing about split tests, which I know you know is that you have to have a certain amount of conversions before you can declare a winner, so that requires the amount of volume to be happening. And so people will be like, well, okay, did it win or did it not win? You can't force the declaration of a winning split test until you have volume period, because you want to be confident that you know, and it takes roughly 100 conversions to have some certainty. And that depends on how big the gap is anyway, on the split test. Today 30 to day 60 is optimizing and seeing how it's doing. And it's also getting some customer feedback. And it's filling the holes. So something probably got missed, maybe on an automation level, maybe a pixels not firing, maybe the data is not reporting correctly. But it's fixing anything that got broken during the first phase of 30 days, while we were building something always goes wrong, it needs to be fixed and handled and that takes time.
01:00:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
One thing is that if Karina, that's working really well, mean put this as a post and nothing held back as just value add. The VA, I told her to hire from online jobs.ph, I told her to look at hiring someone with higher IQ because we're service and so this person is not a setter that calls to like, what could call the person was just simply texting and messaging the buyers to, hey, did you get your purchase? I gave you simple process of that, because of that good will or good karma, then those people are more likely to buy other stuff from that map. Then what she also did, because we've been running ads for so long, went back to all the old ads, the actual posts, like within the Facebook ads ID, the actual posts, because she messaged the VA, messaged every single person commenting, hey, just wondering if you're still looking for this did you get value from this did you and then from that that increased like she's making about 10k now a month in sales organically for that for an $800 person and but the reason why we had that asset she's running ads for two years right and so you should put that in 60 in the 60 to 90 days slot so coffee shop millionaire how to click bank penalizes you when you have too high of household and so they got penalized big time and all that I implemented was zendesque and an FAQ section and we dropped it down to less than 2%.
01:01:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
38 reduction in refunds by having good customer support so yours is actually proactive support rather than reactive right and in that went to there's a saying in sports that the best off best defense is a good offense you don't even need a defense, if your offense is so good that you're always on their side of the field and not on yours, right? So what you did was you had a great offense, right? You're going out so hard that you're actually converting them to the next level of sales. There doesn't even come up an issue of customer support.
01:02:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This just happens probably in the same conversation. You don't think we can add an FAQ section like in between day 30 to 60?
01:02:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think you should. I think the whole point of creating this scope is not overdoing it. This is a lot of mental work. They, oh, yeah, they zero to 30. Sorry, 30 to 60. You could be starting to do this. Yes. But you, maybe you have the VA do it. So if you do out of scope of support is outsourced VA, then you delegate the VA to start capturing frequently asked questions. As long as you're not doing it, that's okay.
01:03:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, here, start capturing.
01:03:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, 60 to 90, not 0 to 30, or I mean 30 to 60, 30 to 60 is okay, but not before that. I'd probably have that more at 60 to 90 because we don't want to overwork your brain. There's a lot of data to process in 0 to 30 and 30 to 60. Less than 30 to 60, but now 60 to 90, to me, that's optimization, which FAQs and customer support to me is in the optimization realm, but it could be considered fulfillment. So 60 to 90, I mean 30 to 60, it could be in there. It depends on what you want to do and how zealous you feel about it.
01:03:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was thinking it was my funnel. I would want to start maybe in a section.
01:03:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And I. I like the golden rule methodology of things.
01:04:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If I were doing it, if it was my business, this is what I would do. How about refine?
01:04:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So that is an ongoing process. It should always continue to be refined. And also, what I would be doing in that portion is looking at how do we use AI to improve it?
01:04:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Cool.
01:04:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And as far as you going, any services that you offer, knowing what is AI tools and staying on top of that technology to know what can be used to scrape and automate those questions, and because it has the ability to say, somebody asked this question, and this verbiage is different, but it's pretty much the same question. So I'm going to count that as a number. That didn't exist a few years ago, and it does now, so we could create. Additionally, building in here a chatbot for sales and support, 60 to 90 days, or you know now we're getting into phase two of just kind of optimizing and growing scale.
01:05:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Any eye chatbot?
01:05:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:05:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But that's out of scope of the 5000 month, isn't it?
01:05:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, so that could be the next 90 days. And you could say, now this is above and beyond creating and optimization, but this is optimized in scale. first 90 days is create, establish and grow. And second 90 days could be like grow and optimize, optimize, grow, whatever. And then I don't even know you want to put grip, but the third phase is just maintenance and scale. scaling, which seems like they're not the same thing, but when people neglect maintenance and they focus on scaling, then there's problems.
01:06:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, so we try to, day zero 30 is phase one, optimize and grow?
01:06:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nope, day, phase one is 90 days. So that's why the whole point of the long term view, like we have six to nine months. Six to nine months allows for the three phases. the first phase is just really creation. The second phase is optimization and the third phase is scaling. And the third phase is the third 90 days.
01:06:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, day 90 to like next 90 days. Yeah. Phase two.
01:07:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
01:07:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Is it you just call it optimization or scale?
01:07:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Optimizing and preparation for scale. Prepare for So the first thing that you do is look at, you know, maintaining anything from phase one, anything created in phase one. And then now you're going to look for what are...
01:07:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hold on. Let me just hit pause for second. a comment here, but it's one.
01:07:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll hear you.
01:07:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I got about 20 more minutes. But this is for them.
01:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like what you're we could so many days we'll average I'm excited because I have so much stuff in my brain that I would love to teach and love to get well to use but I won't do it by myself Maria so yeah you're capturing a lot of stuff yeah sorry yeah we can sell this as a consulting kit because everyone wants to start an agency make a current revenue can go high level like this we could totally certified people in this and sell it and we've got the notes from every call okay so phase two is we're maintaining everything that was created in in phase one including the split test process right in the customer support process but most of what phase two is it's continuing to optimize right so understanding our split test results and improving them but the other thing is before we get to scale is where have we left money on the table is there a compliment Mentory or supplementary offer we didn't put out there that we should have that we're getting the feedback from our customers Right so if somebody through the FAQ is in the customer support I said, you know what I have this knowledge this gap this gap in knowledge And it's not being addressed here. How do I get this addressed or? I want more hand-holding. How do I get more hand-holding? or Okay, well you taught me how to do all of these things, but I don't know how to outsource it You're not teaching me how to outsource it. Can you teach me how to outsource? now we create an outsourcing product. So the next 90 days is learning from our customers what we could do better and How do we increase the lifetime value of the customer and but also the average order value? You So, that's it, that's it, that's it, it's just massage everything and make it as good as we can. Phase three is scale and it's, you need to look at the pace of scale and the cost of scale. Is that your mama?
01:10:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Amanda.

I should just cut back. Okay. Tell me about Amanda. Yes, bye. Yeah. Anyway, so I saw you smiling in the earbuds or so. Anyway. Um, so scale is first, you have to create the strategy for scale. Right. So that's a long discussion. That's not a one off conversation. That's not a one off meeting. That's a whole process. And here's why you doing everything in Trello for them is so important, is because you will have kind of an inventory of what it took to get to where you're doing and what it's taking to manage the current business, right? So you know how many people it takes to fulfill, and hopefully by phase two we've learned how to fulfill well what we're currently fulfilling. So if we were to two X thoughts or three or four X that, what would it take in fulfillment and who's running it and who's leaning it and who's managing it? So how much high-level mental power and energy and leadership is that taking? And can we do that with the existing people? Can we two X with our existing team? Can we four X with our existing team if we can, then we just go through that process. Keeping in mind and making sure that our content. I understand that you can't just go, especially with Facebook and I don't know about other platforms, but especially with Facebook, you can't just go double your ad spend and they double you get a lot of the times that backfires you immediately your ad spend and all of a sudden you're losing the leads that you get it makes zero sense, but I've seen it happen repeatedly.
01:12:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I think this one is more look at other profit sources as well.
01:12:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, but that's really to me that was happening in phase two.
01:12:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Phase two, oh, okay, but no, yeah, I mean, maybe, no, no, no, okay, so phase two, we need to profit sources.
01:12:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was thinking about this right complimentary products that were missing, but you're talking about channels.
01:12:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no hidden money. Yeah, I was thinking about complimentary products, but scale here is like expand other marketing channels.
01:12:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, add channels. Okay, got it.
01:12:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I totally agree with that.
01:12:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay. So how can we replicate our marketing across channels? You know what, if we map this out really well, and then we go get Maui or somebody to make this into a beautiful PDF or slideshows, and then you're presenting this to your clients. Oh my gosh, like a pitch deck. Girl, kind of like just close it.
01:13:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah, like, because, you know, ages ago, when I worked as a strategy, chief strategy person for the, we see what's her name, Emily Hirsch. I actually created for her because she just had a document like that. I said, you know, if you want to close more clients, because I learned that from work for the big consulting firms, we need graphics, right? So we would, I'm just showing you, we would make of these kind of sales projection graphics. See that within sense, they send conversions. And then we would make, let's see.
01:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know what I want now. What do you want? I want to work in companies like you with you. All the things that I've been doing. I want you to be the CMO. I want to be the COO. But I just want to have the teams. only want to have one or two meetings a week.
01:14:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Everybody do their stuff.
01:14:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I love using my brain.
01:14:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So I created this on paper and then I hired someone on fiber to put it in digital format. But like, so we could mimic this because it's so beautiful. Mimic this with what you just talked about. Yes. Three phases.
01:14:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, we are magic together.
01:14:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We are. thing is, he's expecting the proposal today, though. So I think I need to give it to him word format, just so he has it because I told him I'd give it to him. And he really wants to know what's out of scope. But I think I have enough from you right now, but I agree.
01:15:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think eventually we make a pitch deck like this That's what this is right.
01:15:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, this is actually the guy that does the guy her Lee So let's use the guy that on the MacGyver show. He's the writer for MacGyver. That's amazing. This guy.
01:15:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah Here's what I think I know you have to go in a few minutes if you close this guy Yes, then and I'm happy to spend any of our time during the week just helping you Mm-hmm. you don't need help But if we can speed it up so that we can get to some of this stuff together then then again I'm always looking out for me. I'll be honest But what I would love then to do is is take what's happening there because so You know how to go make all the money But what you can see is a light outline the operation and it immediately comes out of my brain like it doesn't take any time Next step, next step, next step, I can go hire the people, I can bring them in, train, insert, whatever. But anyway, if we take all of this stuff in our, in whatever free time is available, and now you've got enough money and you'll be okay, then let's go pitch a client or two max. But they got to be doing 50,000, I would rather see them doing 100,000 a month with roughly 40% profit margins, and they want a COO and a CMO who work together, who will take everything top to bottom and execute it. And we put out killer, like we just put out a few skills that show what we do, and we just wait until somebody takes us up on it, because your money's coming in enough, mine's coming in enough, and we'll wait until the perfect match comes in, and then we get to play together and build this, and then get testimonials from that. So it's a slow pace, but it means we're not For you mean or replicate to other nope, so I call it face so face three and beyond The face three and you're kind of always in face three every product or Like I don't know what you would call it offer every Product offer type Once you get to phase three, is no additional phase. That's it's to infinity because that's scale Unless base four would be selling mean exit the business.
01:18:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
mean yes, God, got Well, did you say before like what was initially face three and Replicate based on it's just scaling and until you can't scale anymore or you want to sell and exit So for for this, that's it For one product market offer type whatever that's this is it It's just continuing
01:19:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
no optimization, sell the offer, sell the business, it both they're there, they can be separate because sometimes, you know, you, you can sell something off piece by piece. So, but then, so what I would do beyond this is go, um, uh, so that's step one of getting towards the Brooke business, right? After phase three, step two, so this is not a phase, but this is, this is a step on the mission, right? Um, um, is launch the next product. And I don't know how that fits into her model, because I don't know anything about her.
01:19:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Does she have all these different types of products? Does have now and she has lot of coaches underneath her and stuff, so she has a 25 case certification, but she stopped it all that. I won't go into detail now because I think I'm ready to send this to him because I know he's expecting it. Um, I have to go for massage and
01:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like 20 minutes.
01:20:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
terrible. I know, yeah. So, so, but, um, so in scope, I can just keep us assets. creating for you assets.
01:20:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I really like bullets too.
01:20:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think bullets just help the eyes. My problem is that I don't know Google sheets that well, so you want to do bullets to ads?
01:20:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so it's just line breaks and then highlighting it. What do you mean? Let's do this under assets. Yeah, essentially. I was gonna say, if you could share it, I'll just do it for you real quick. But, um, okay.
01:20:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm happy to help. It is. Copy link.
01:20:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, um, can you do T net profit drivers? That's my main. That's what I'm always in.
01:20:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Either one without profit drivers.
01:20:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll leave them. Actually, I'll leave them both of them, but, okay.
01:21:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then I could also put the link in the chat.
01:21:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's probably fast. Then I'll go do it super quick. Okay. That way it helps with this eyeballs and, um, okay. So where are we at?
01:21:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Uh, right. Then I can see what you're doing too.
01:21:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I. Should be able to work. Okay. if that doesn't work, here's what we do. We just go up here. There.
01:21:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I am. I'm seeing what you're doing. I was just like, screw it. either take it into Canva or hire someone to fix it.
01:21:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. But so that just, and sometimes I will do things like, um, uh, like, I'm not telling you to do this for this one. But anyway, just the little bit of color pop. On things that are really important. Oh, so actually what I would do is do it right here. Oh, shoot.
01:21:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That is not a good color. Sorry.
01:21:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Amazon color. Yeah. It's just, it's. Just a little bit of yeah. Anyway.
01:22:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
01:22:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anything I can do to help energize them immediately and help them focus. And when I'm talking to them, keep them, because everybody's distracted by the phones where you're talking to them, they're looking at all these alerts and notifications or whatever. So if I want them to pay attention to the value I'm bringing and I'm trying to make a sale, or I'm trying to persuade them to say yes and do the thing they need to do, everything I can do to keep their attention focused is for their benefit, but also my clients. I won't drag people. little things to psychologically help them stay focused means that we get there going faster. because I know most entrepreneurs have ADD of some sort or another have focus attention. I'm always trying to be like focus on what I'm having to focus focus. Anyway, I know you got to go.
01:22:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I hope this is helpful. This is really helpful. So, so. the rest of document, though, we didn't finish what's out of scope, though, right?
01:23:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, anything beyond this is out of scope. So, um, like, if you want to write a brand new sales letter, are you doing it? Or are you hiring our copywriter?
01:23:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, well, in the existing funnel of specific upsell one, upsell two, yes, that's in scope.
01:23:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. that's the type of thing I'm thinking. So like you already put graphics out there, a VA is out of scope. So for like following up with customers, that's out of scope. Customer support is out of scope.
01:23:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Hiring and paying a VA. I want to customer support.
01:23:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. would include help desk, FAQs, et cetera. Chatbot, is that in scope of support or out of scope of support?
01:23:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think I can help strategize to chatbot.
01:24:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But actually creating it, I think that someone else should. So chatbot creation and then in parentheses, I will create the strategy. Somebody else must implement or execute, or that's an additional fee. So like, if you want to do it and manage it, even if you outsource it, you need to be paid for that. Yeah, most contracts are not this detailed.
01:24:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know, yeah.
01:24:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then something you might put in parentheses is to improve the beautifying, improve customer content consumption, and execution. Maybe parentheses at the end of it.
01:24:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, or should I just take that out for now? Just graphic design? Yeah, maybe he's really proud of the playbook when I
01:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's awesome.
01:25:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, that's smart.
01:25:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, I'll end up later.
01:25:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oops.
01:25:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like one idea.
01:25:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anything else on a screen?
01:25:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Well, I mean, um, weekends? Yes.
01:25:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, so like I'm not available via text.
01:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not available after this hours unless there's a fire. I always put a fire. So the only thing that, um, a fire is orders are broken and they don't work. But I would still say, um, if you want somebody to fix that type of thing, we have a developer on call.
01:25:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm not your developer. Yeah. Oh, the list is a fire.
01:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In which case you're only available for consulting, not operating or something, whatever.
01:25:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You just say unless there's a fire and then elaborate on a call what that is. Yeah, how about you say weekends? I'm not an electrified balance. So there's fire. That's fine. I think that's, um, I was going to say one more thing that I just thought of. It's important. Oh, cost of the ads.
01:26:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
01:26:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, it's the actual. That's been spent is in your account. On the credit card. I know that's very detailed, but.
01:26:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I should put my half these pink migraine glasses. I should put them over here because they really do help with I string to.
01:26:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would scope would be a brand new low ticket offer. How about that? A brand new low ticket. Well, as that would be an additional.
01:26:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I would say anything outside of what is on this document is out of scope of support.
01:27:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, that's kind of what is on, I would say, what is on this document is out of scope. Oh, sorry.
01:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You like what? What is on this document? What is on the scope of this document? Because then it's kind of like redundant.
01:27:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you think I'm sorry what is on this document? Okay.
01:27:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would make these bullets. And highlight the required 90 day contract. And I would use the brighter yellow for that one, bold bullet. Okay. Thank
01:28:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was going to take out, if you look at the biggest brands, the moans use blue because he uses blue and his branding, but I think we'll just leave it as optimizing the emotions.
01:28:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. going to do this really. What the heck?
01:28:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. I know. don't.
01:28:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's what I hate Google Docs for. Did you copy and paste anything into here?
01:28:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No.
01:28:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's weird. It's not that bad. Okay. Cool. Um, out of scope and then we'll do, you know, there we go up on do, okay.
01:28:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I say contract, but really it's not really contract to say required 90 day commitment.
01:28:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What about? Yeah. There we go. Out of scope. And I would actually make this like, well, that's harsh. Hold on. That's what I'll do. This is. That's. That's. That's. And that.
01:29:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Graphics Designer, as far as telling them what to do, because graphics designer, I'm saying the outsourcing graphic designer.
01:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Graphics creation. Because you'll direct what graphics are needed to be creative and not create them yourself.
01:29:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Director, how's that?
01:29:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
01:29:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Graphics design direction. To increase. I guess I would scope as cost of software is right as well.
01:29:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, for sure.
01:29:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think that sums it up.
01:29:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Awesome. I'm excited for you to have that call. can't wait to hear about it. I'll be like, tell me you got the sale, tell me you got the sale, and you get paid before any other conversations happen paid up front, not after the fact upfront.
01:30:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes, yeah, because it's just the stock and the loan gives in the plan.
01:30:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and yes, and that has lots of value. Okay, so you're amazing. You

> 00:00:02 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Hey, yeah, I can hear you.
00:00:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How was vacation?
00:00:05 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
It was good. Just got home really late last night. But other than that, it was fun.
00:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I had a good time. Yeah. Was it like a family thing or you just like hanging out?
00:00:18 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Nice. Nice.
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel? Well, you probably feel too tired to be refreshed, but. Yeah. Do you feel refreshed at all?
00:00:30 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah. Because my friends like, we like to really chill out. So we weren't doing too many activities.
00:00:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice.
00:00:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
We had a lot of time to relax and stuff. So I didn't think I needed a vacation. But after I came back, was like, yeah, needed that.
00:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's funny sometimes how you don't know what you need until you get it.
00:00:53 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
And then you're like, oh, It's like sometimes getting a massage and like the masseuse gets in there. like, I did not know that. I heard that bad and then exactly you did that and I was like, oh, I think I needed that.
00:01:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good though. I'm glad that you got it and I'm glad you got that perspective and hopefully you'll remember both that it was useful but also that you weren't aware of how much you needed it. So in the future just kind of think about your time and your energy and maybe there are other things that are day to day like you can't have a vacation all the time but like maybe there are other kinds of things that you could do with your time and your energy that would be helpful that you didn't really know would be like that impactful.
00:01:42 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
You know what I mean?
00:01:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So you've been gone a while so I have no idea if you've thought about any of the conversations we've been talking about like it's been a while a couple weeks since we've chatted. Any, any thoughts where you were gone or just preparing for the call today?
00:02:10 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Um, probably, but I don't really remember the last meeting.
00:02:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:02:18 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
know most of it was with Lorenz and, you know, how he structures his team and everything like that. But I mean, some good news is, you know, I was gone for a week and I would still check my computer and stuff, but I'm proud of the team because it's all the work that they were doing and, you know, how they were handling everything and, you know, obviously I wasn't there working full time, but it looks like they were able to hold things down, which makes me comfortable knowing that they were working and able to kind of handle the caselope without me being there. Um, so that was good to see that's that's awesome.
00:03:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Actually, so let me go because I was looking at the numbers for one. Um, which one is. Okay, July so for. So what I was finding interesting. And this month is definitely going to be skewed a little bit because you're out. Hold on a second. I'm still reviewing it. Um, so first of all, let's just kind of recap. Well, I'm taking it. I lost my notes. I don't have too many windows, but I need a few of them to be able to do this. So some of the things that we had talked about was just. Um, the leadership that you were already working on and employing in your team, things like noticing that. at Patsy needed a little bit more clarity and direction and like do this and you don't need to be asked to do it just you know here's your job here's what we expect and and get that done which probably went into you know how things went when you were gone and then I never really I don't know but I haven't memorized who you have I feel like it's Elsie I'm Cynthia Elsie and Cynthia yeah wait did I say Patsy what did I say yeah Patsy sorry I meant Cynthia oh my gosh I don't know what there's some names it just makes up in my head but I did know the difference sorry um although I don't have bases for either one of them so that that kind of happens but Patsy's are in Take Lady and Cynthia is yours and she's been bounced around a few people I remember um anyway so just kind of thinking about That those leadership roles, thinking about the kind of person that you are for your team, that you can be a safe space, which means that you actually have the ability to ask of your team things that other people couldn't. And I don't mean, you know, exceeding boundaries or anything, but meaning that they wouldn't get the same kind of results that you would because you're a safe person, because you'll ask and rather than make somebody feel afraid to mess up or do something wrong or get in trouble, they'll be like, oh, yeah, I totally could do that. And they feel empowered to be able to try to do their best job, because when people are afraid of making mistakes, they don't actually do their best at all. They just do just enough to get bias so that they don't cause problems, which is actually counterproductive, because they end up not, you know, giving their all, but it makes them feel a little bit safer to stay safe. smaller if that makes sense.
00:06:02 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Right.
00:06:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But because you have an energy that is not that is like you are intentionally looking out for how they feel and not wanting to overwhelm or intimidate or scare them off or make them feel bad, you can ask for say, you know, let's just just for example what you did with Cynthia say these are the things that I need you to do and then have compliance and have a work on it. So one of the things to try to look for is what are the other things that might be able to improve a little bit in terms of have follow up maybe with cases and making making calls in a timely manner, making sure that the cases that have the greatest potential for higher attorney fees are handled, or if one is at risk for whatever reason of sub-out or drop-out, well, not sub-out, but yeah, sub-out, not drop-out. That's being prioritized so that we don't lose the case, things like that. So that's one thing. I'm thinking I forgot what I was going to ask you. I should have wrote that down. Oh, oh proud. Okay, so we're looking at stats. me just provide some real quick. And I'm going to share my screen and don't think I'm sharing anything I'm not supposed to, and then I'll just get yelled at if I am just kidding because Mark doesn't yell, but not me anyway. Does Mark yell?
00:07:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Never.
00:07:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That sounds not right. I mean, I can see him having it, especially the conversations we had in the beginning. I think he told me about having a temper and I think I yelled at him a few times and said stop it. So, but I don't know how he is now. Anyway, okay, so I'm looking at cases this year and obviously I know that the thing to keep in mind is that you, your cases are throttled. You get a lot of Mark's cases. they're not just your own and everything hasn't been opened up to you like it has to the other attorneys. So, this is not apples to apples by any means. But I still think that it's impressive in the resolutions. So, in June, Tyler had 19, Samantha had 21, and you had 21. And to me, and I could be wrong about this, but that's kind of a good indicator. So, there was this, but it's not enough data, right? So, Look how small this one. There's only three for the month so far compared to 13 and seven and I almost don't even want to compare Tyler. I'd rather compare just Samantha. And then Lauren's isn't even on the board for this month. So You know what resolutions mean, like, is that Is it isn't that when you are paid out? Which one is the one that's your paid out? Which one is the one that it's done done?
00:09:30 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Done done is money and attorney's fees.
00:09:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but there's And then there's cases settled. Yes, and that's which one I'm trying to figure out cases closed or resolution.
00:09:44 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
That's one of these two. Okay, because whichever Okay, yeah, cases closed would mean money and And then resolution is like any sort of settlement.
00:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, so that that's what I was looking at. And that's the thing, this is what you guys have the most control over, not when you get paid, right?
00:10:05 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
How much do I have for resolutions?
00:10:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For this month?
00:10:10 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
00:10:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Three.
00:10:12 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah, that's not accurate.
00:10:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and that's the other thing, this is a new report. So I don't know if you remember, I was looking at it and saying I didn't know if I want to show it yet.
00:10:21 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah, my list is 10, so.
00:10:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and what about last month?
00:10:27 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
So I can compare. Last month was 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 2, 14, 15, 16, 18. 18? And those were all my cases, were any mark crossovers.
00:10:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and then let's compare cases closed, so paid, is I want to see what these numbers are and then all.
00:10:55 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
So last month I had 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
00:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, Okay. And the month before. One, two, three, four, five, six, eight. Okay. Oh, what did I click on? I'm gonna do that. Okay, so then I need to send a note off just a second. Mark.
00:12:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
You Okay.
00:12:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, I sent that off. Hopefully we can get that figured out. Oh, let's see. Policy limit. Okay, I'm not going to look at this anymore right now, whoops, because I want to make sure that it's accurate. So we'll dig into that. That report's only actually few days old, a few days, a few weeks old, and it usually takes us a few iterations, actually, let me go, let's see, reports, oh, that's why report reports. Let's see matters closed, we'll just type in matters, matters by team, or by principal attorney active matters, and I want that, I want that much by team. Let's see if I can edit this. No filter. I. Attorney. No, not as fun to be. Owner. So would the attorney be the owner?
00:14:29 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Probably. Yeah, that would be accurate. Sometimes it'll change and the owner will be the old attorney, but I don't have too many of those.
00:14:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so we'll just say. See if that will. Well. Save and run. And then. right. right. right. All right.
00:15:21 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
That means we take our fee and hold like a certain amount in a trust account until I'll hold in trust.
00:15:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, let's see but there's 141. So does that sound right? 141 records that you think that you've gone through? Let's see if I can create a status. I do want already. All right. So part of this process, though, is learning how to get better reports so that we can have, first of all, accurate data and then, well, accurate data that matters and really review it so that you can know exactly where you stand and also how you're ranking within the team. So since I don't have something reliable, how about you tell me what your team did while you were gone is as much detail as possible because that will also help me with the reporting stuff and then also help us with next questions and what we're going to work on.
00:16:46 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
You said how they did when were gone. would have to be choked.
00:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, let's just do this. Let's kind of take inventory of last week. So we'll look at how many new cases were there. How many got settled. Just any, any issues, any calls, if there was any disbursements that happened. Yeah.
00:17:23 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Okay, let me see. We got one, two, four, five new cases last week. We did two settlements last week. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. And then for fees, we got two as well.
00:18:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what percentage of. So you're going, your max is 40% right for attorney fees. Yeah. What, what, what were each of those two cases?
00:18:25 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
40%.
00:18:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
00:18:29 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah. One of them was a big, big case or fee was 68,000.
00:18:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And who handled that conversation?
00:18:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
I did that one. Oh, you did that.
00:18:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, good job. Okay. So you handled the conversation about distributions, not disbursements.
00:18:54 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah. Actually, for all my cases, I do once it gets to like closing it out, getting the district. patient sign, I do all that.
00:19:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, for all the cases, so what I'm trying to dig into is when you came back and you said your team did really well, how do you measure that? How do you quantify that? Like, what did you look at and go? That's they did that well.
00:19:25 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
I noticed I got multiple emails on certain cases where we were waiting one medical bill in order for me to send a demand and they would let me know that it came in and that it's ready to be demanded. The new cases that come in, I know that's all mostly LC, reaching out to the clients, setting them up with treatment. That was getting done. I can see that certain things that were coming in, Cynthia was saving them in the case files, know, notating how much the chiropractor. it was, we use this internal thing on Lidify, it's called Chatter. That's where they kind of let me know, you know, this on updates on cases. We had one case, it was like a weird sub out, it's one of Mark's cases, I guess the guy had another firm for like a while, and then he signed on with us. But I wasn't there to, you know, handle that, and Cynthia was able to send all the documents, the case file, so that got handled. And I would see the notifications on slide, like a call would come in, and you know, I'll see what, you know, take it. So I keep eye on those things, which lets me know that, you know, if they're not really on top of things that they'll either be slow to respond, or they won't take the call. Um, so that lets me know that, you know, they were on top of everything. Um, was sending me requests for authorized treatment for certain clients, um, is important because we need to make sure that, you know, the policy limits are adequate enough to authorize certain treatment, for example, Um, so she was asking me, you know, she was sending me emails and saying, can you please, you know, authorize X for this client?
00:21:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, and you, you know, you were on vacation. You responded to all of that?
00:21:39 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah. Yeah. had my computer out there. So, um, when I had time, I would go through and see what, you know, what was urgent and respond to those.
00:21:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think your average response time was during that time.
00:21:51 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
I was pretty slow because we're three hours behind over there. So. I was working like. I was. eight PM our time.
00:22:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you were so they never waited longer than a day. Yeah, that's awesome. I mean, you're you're so that kind of speaks to the leadership skills too. And now I know that it comes with the territory that stuff still has to get handled and has to be done timely.
00:22:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
But that doesn't mean everybody does their job. You know that, right? Yeah, I know.
00:22:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So one of the things that that probably had a huge impact on the fact that your team was staying on top of it was that you were also staying on top of it, even when on vacation. So that's really important. And you gave them a very clear signal that work matters and that we will we will get things done. And so even while not being physically present, although are you guys all remote? Who's in the office?
00:22:50 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Um, they're both in the office every now and then I'll see what we'll come home. Um, that's for the most part. She's she's in the office.
00:22:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So that's great. Now, if you were to go and look for things that maybe weren't handled well, first of all, did it occur to you to do that? Did you think about doing that? Did you do that? Look to see if anything slipped while you were on it.
00:23:20 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah, because what happens is on like, at some point we'll get like our clients policy limits or the other, you know, full parties policy limits. And I noticed like on two cases, like, because we get a lot of documents from this and team, it's like a lot. And I already told the team, like, I have like a CD, so I'll double check to make sure certain things get notated. And naturally like things, even when I'm there, like, I'll see we'll get to it, but for me, like knowing the policy limits is like one of the key parts of the case, because it's so easy to like authorize an injection. or we don't know what the limits are and it can get really bad, so I just like to know and it's just like a piece of mine for everybody, even Mark, when he's looking through the case to know, it's like our baseline for how the case is going to go. So I just noticed like we would get a declaration page which shows policy limits and then just wasn't notated in the file. So there were a few cases where I went and I did that myself, which I do when I'm in the office anyways. But other than that, nothing where I was like, hey, like keep an eye on this, can't make this mistake again type of thing. I just honestly felt like I was just another week.
00:24:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so that kind of stuff happens anyway, right?
00:24:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Is that what you're saying? it gets done, but like I'm just like when I see those like two letters PL, which means policy limits like I'm just like really quick on it just because I don't want to miss it.
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you've communicated that I'm sure you have to them that that that's the thing that like that has to be on every single case.
00:25:07 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
00:25:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how is that received? you feel like? I mean, this is the job and nobody's perfect all the time. Right. There's got to be a margin of error. But what we can do, what we can work on is focus on the big rocks. So what. What are the things that matter the most knowing what the policy limits are definitely right up there.
00:25:36 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Right.
00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if something else slips, that's maybe less important. And I don't even know what that would be. But, but let's say that there are non-negotiable like these always need to get done. matter what. Don't everyone see this. There's not a threat implied that there are anything. It's just that this is non-negotiable. Make sure this happens on every case. Do not finish or no. until you've checked yourself, are the policy limits notated, that type of thing. Have you had a conversation to that degree? Now, I can sound very kind of like hostile forcehole. So I'm not talking about with my energy, right? I'm talking about with that kind of clarity and emphasis on this has to be done every time.
00:26:26 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah, that's one of them. Because even they know like, if we don't know what type of insurance we're dealing with because Elsie sets up the treatment. So once she goes to do that, she'll naturally have a tendency to look and see how much room we have money-wise, you know, for treatment. Now there are times where we know the other party's insurance or our insurance has like a lot of money, then it's not as important to figure out everybody's coverage because if it's like half a million, like, there's... definitely plenty of money, so we don't need to know exactly how much everybody has right now, because the case probably won't go that far. But on cases where she's going to set up treatment a week or two has gone by and we don't have any insurance yet, then it's like they know to make sure we figure out or else if you're authorizing treatment without any insurance because there may not even be any insurance. That's when that gets like expedited, so they'll figure out how much money we have to work with. That's one. Another one is client calls when we get a new case, not to let it like more than one day go by without any client contact. I'm trying to think of other non-negotiables. like if a client's like kind of threatening to sub out like any type of like text or anything like that to call them right away or well sometimes I'll call right away just to kind of calm the client down because if you know say we get that text and no one reached out then it's you know pretty bad mistake so that's another one. Certain things like if we have a $15,000 limit never authorized more than one MRI because we don't have the money to. The teams are pretty good at that. I would say those are like the main like none of those triple things it's just like basic case management setups.
00:28:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I know that you're not in the place where you get incentive yet. And I know that the team doesn't have an incentive plan, but right now Samantha has her own, Lorenz has his own. I did talk to Mark about trying to standardize that. That's kind of a long process. It's an ongoing conversation about modifying that anyway. But in the meantime, these are the types of things that would be generating incentive pay for you, which would then give you something to reward them with. So do you have any sets, kind of review periods with your team or just like one-on-one conversations and meetings about performance and any issues they might have and what kind of support they need as a structured set type of conversation?
00:29:58 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
We have our weekly meetings. But other than that, like anything one on one haven't really done yet. Cynthia will come in like every now and then and just, you know, to me, make sure that she's doing a good job. And then with Elsie, I haven't had a one on one with her yet. I think she's only been with us almost not even six months yet. But like on the big cases where I know like it was a pain to settle that one or get it done or like a really big one, I make sure like on our settlement channel, you know, to put their names in there too, just to make sure that they feel like they're a part of it because it's so easy for the attorney to take credit on the cases where in reality, like the team is the one who's doing a majority of the grant work that helped. I'll just get the case done. I know Cynthia appreciates that a lot. I'll see's a little bit more.
00:31:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The appreciates just being given credit for that work? Yeah.
00:31:11 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Lawrence told me that when she did come to my team. So that's been good. So I keep those things in mind. if I know there was one case, almost half a million settlement, Cynthia helped get these records that the insurance really wanted to see before they would throw out an offer and she got that done really quickly. So when we settled the case, I made sure to put her name in there too, and how she helped contribute to the case. That's like not money stuff incentive, but yeah, I know that if I was on her end, you know, I would appreciate my work being noted, you know, that way, when they come to work, it's not like, well, I'm doing all this work and the attorneys. Taking all the credit for it. They get more pay to me Because at the end of the day like I feel like everybody thinks about those type of things I want my team to know like Just because I have a degree doesn't mean like I'm on a different pedestal Now sometimes I'll request records if I really need it Just to show them that like we're all on the same They level like no one's better than anybody And I feel like those type of things when I'm gone. It's like they do their best job when I'm not there out of respect Because of the way that you know I treat them overall Ask you a question though Do Cynthia doesn't do I have any kind of college degree? I don't know to be honest or elsey I'm not sure either one does the one thing to keep in mind is
00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
on a human being level and on a showing up to work level, know, that part is equal, but the investment that you made to get to your job is not.
00:33:12 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Right.
00:33:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
of school, so that kind of time, and then also the money that goes into school, whether you paid it out of pocket or however it got funded, that's a lot of money. Yeah. that, you'll never get that time back. You invested that to be here, whereas somebody else just applied for our job. So even if they got experience on the job somewhere else, they were still getting paid for that.
00:33:41 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
You don't get paid to go to school.
00:33:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. that is one thing to keep in mind when it comes to it is that you're not all equal in the workforce when it comes to that because you've paid a price that they didn't pay. So, your return is, the other thing is they are not accountable when things go wrong, you have the liability they don't. And part of the compensation is your risk and your liability for the work that's getting done. And that's a real thing. Now the odds that something is going to go so bad that you're going to, that it's going to ever actually cost you is probably pretty low because you're managing things well. But there is real risk involved in practicing law. And they don't have that risk, they don't bear that risk. And they didn't make the investment of all that time and all that money. So it is important and I want you just to kind of stash that away in case it ever comes up. And at least just ponder it like what does that mean and how would that show up when you do get incentive and I think that that is something that you should take into account. This isn't about being better than anyone else or how you show up right now. So for example, you know, when I do my work, I've had people try to figure out how long something takes me and want to pay me an hourly rates. And I work faster than five, sometimes 10 people, depending on who it is. I, but the reason I can do that is because I've acquired a lot of skill in my practice. I've put in hours and hours and hours of work and study and repetitions to make me really good at it. I have top-of-the-line equipment all the time, all the time. I say on top of it all the time. So when somebody's paying me and I don't even do hourly work anymore, but when somebody's paying me, they're getting access to all of that. All of those scales, all that experience, the money that I spent on the technology. And so they're trying to compare me, sometimes they would, this is historical, try to compare me to somebody else or what they think is industry standard. I'm like, son, I'm not industry standard. Look at the results, that's obvious. But it's the same kind of math, right? People want to do and think that they're doing the equation and that this is what it's like in a job. We're all a team and we're all equal, but not all teams are equal. So let's say you've got the captain of the varsity team and he steps down to play with the second string and they're not all equal. The skill level is not equal, the hours probably are not equal. So it's just important. I just want you to make sure that you keep that in mind. there's a way to use that information. and not understanding without, you know, it's not a power trip or lording over. I just want to make sure that you don't undermine yourself or discount what you have brought to the table and also the burden that you bear that is invisible because liability nobody's thinking about it. You might think about it from time to time. They're probably not thinking like if this goes wrong, you know, I might lose job at Patrick could be sued. You know what I mean?
00:37:33 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
00:37:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, I know it was a long whole monologue thing. I just want to talk about these things as we're kind of going into how you're structuring and leaning. Okay, so client calls now. Okay, so I think that it would be a good idea for you to set up and they can be very short, but monthly one-on-ones with individual member. So with right, your current team is just LC and Cynthia. So with each of them, and it should have a specific agenda of things that need to be covered for sure, all the non-negotiables should be covered, things that you've noticed. Hey, Cynthia, great job. a single one of your people went more than a day without being contacted when you were here, right? Any kind of threats to sub out, you handled it immediately. You never authorized more than one MRI when somebody had a $15,000 any of those things. So first of all, they know how much you're paying attention to what they're doing, and they're getting credit for not just, hey, good job, but very specific, good job, right? Did you play sports?
00:38:52 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
don't remember if you told me that or not. Yeah, I played a waterfall and I swam in high school.
00:38:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's right. I remember I remembered it was water. I forgot about the polo, but yeah, so anyway, just really specifics about about what they're doing and what they're doing really well and maybe especially because if let's say they're not doing one thing really well, when you bring that out, no, it does not feel good. likes that and but but it still has to be said. You can soften the blow instead of just by saying, hey, you need to fix this because this isn't happening and this is this is crucial. Soften the blow, but you have been amazing at this and you've been amazing at this and you've been amazing at that and so keep doing this job also and not but right because everybody ignores everything after the blood but also let's work on improving this and then when the incentive time comes around, you have specific things that you can. pay your incentive on. So it can be these types of things. There'll probably be some other things you want to break down. Basically, anything that is a lever or a switch, you know, in the business that makes a significant impact that you can track, that you can measure for sure, all of those things that you just mentioned. There may be a little bit more detail and nuance to it. Maybe it's the reporting. Maybe it's the communication. I don't know, but these are the things that we want to look at. And so then if you have a meeting with them each month and you're letting them know, hey, I've looked at all of this stuff and really you're like, I'm so impressed. You did this. You did this. You did this. You did this. You did this. that is amazing. I did notice this. I would love to work on this. Is there any way I can support you in doing better here? And then you be quiet and see what they feel like. And generally, especially if you really have people that want to do well and care about how you feel about it. You'll either maybe get the actually I know that I kind of been dropping the ball and I could do better and just okay will you do better and then again you be quiet. Not just hey I know you can do better but very specifically an accountability question will you do better and if they say they're gonna say yes nobody's gonna say no and sometimes they may say try I'll try and then you can rephrase it and say I didn't ask you if you try I asked you well you do better and if they say well you know I'll try it okay so if you can't commit to doing better is there a reason why you can't commit to doing better is it is that is that hard for you do you need some training in that area is it you know what I mean like Is that an opportunity to either maybe shift that task to somebody else or strengthen them, give them training? But if you see something wrong and they can't say, I 100% can do better and I'm going to do better, then you want to figure out and drill down a little bit more. OK, why not? And how can we make that better? But I think that with the goals that you have for just killing it, really, and the team that you have and the way that you're leading, just so back to leverage, right? Just by picking one particular thing to work on, which would be reviews over a very specific set of topics, which I would love to see. So do you feel like you have enough time to set this up by next Monday when we all meet together?
00:42:53 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
A set of incentive things that I would like to see?
00:42:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It could be incentive. But basically, it's like, what it... What are the criteria that you want to review with each of your team monthly that eventually will be how you can, and you can modify this so this can be rough draft. But what I would like is, yeah, that structure, these are the things that matter most, so I'm going to review it with my team. But also when incentive time comes around, it would make sense that the things that matter most impact incentive. So you don't have to figure out how you would structure it and how you would weigh it and what you would pay. But what are the topics that you would review with each person, and this should be like five to ten elements that you have. And you can rank them right. Here's our five critical and five non-negotiables, and here's our five, know, this is not as important, but this definitely impacts the quality of results type of thing. You think you could have a rough draft that by Monday? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. rough draft. I love the new part to that. Awesome. Awesome. I was thinking about then, you know, let the team know that starting next month and maybe, and maybe it'll be the end of the month so maybe like end of August so you've got time to put this together. And, but then I was thinking maybe we don't want to tell them and tell that you've put something together for sure to let them know what you're going to be measuring, rather than it being like a sucker punch. Hey, I'm looking at this, which it should not be right because they should be very aware of what their duties are. There's a magical thing that happens when people know that they're being scrutinized a little bit more as they perform well, especially if they feel like it's not a negative thing, like someone's paying attention, but they're not, you know, looking for ways to screw up. And you can tell them when they're doing it, like, Hey, I'm going to be looking at these things. And I know that Elsie, you're awesome at this stuff and Cynthia, you're awesome at this stuff. And but I really want to know how to celebrate your wins and really look at where you're shining. But also look for opportunities for improvement and see if there's any kind of training maybe that we can have, because that's the whole point of it, right? We're not trying to ensnare anyone and catch them in a trap. We are trying to help everybody be better and also make sure that we're looking at what we can appreciate in what they're doing. Make sense?
00:45:56 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
00:45:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. What do you think about that? how do you feel? I mean, I basically just kind of said, you should do this.
00:46:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
And I want to know what your thoughts are on it. I think it would be good. I know for Cynthia, it would be good for her to hear that she's doing good because like sometimes we'll just like talk about a case like in my office or whatever. And then before she leaves, she's always like, am I doing good? Like, just want to make sure I'm doing good. So I know she likes to feed back. And then with LC, I mean, we can test it out and see how she likes it. I think it would be good like review every month because like, let's say we set the standard today. Everybody, you know, all the boxes and then like month two, two and a half, things start to like naturally fall off again, which is normal. So it'd be like a good thing that they know like every month. I'm gonna, you know, ask about You know, X, Y, Z Whereas right now it's kind of like we already talked about it and it's up to them how long they want to continue to Work on those things So I might be good to have like a Set date every time, you know once a month that I'm gonna ask them about You know those five to ten key things I'm definitely opening to trying it because They'll also give me an opportunity to know that, you know, we go over this every month.
00:47:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there's no reason for it to Not get done So I do think it's a good idea So couple of things I thought about why you're talking And I know that you're still kind I'm now Elsie's only six months around, Cynthia has been moved around, so really to get a good kind of gauge of things, I would like you to commit to it for a minimum of six months, are you willing to do that?
00:48:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
00:48:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and then the other thing is what I would like you to do, especially so that they feel that this is opening the lines of communication and kind of reinforcing that the fact that this is a safe space is, is there anything, when you, at the end of it, ask them, okay, is there anything that I can do better for you? Do you feel like there's a system or process that needs some improvement? Do you have recommendations about how we can better operate? So it starts with the wins, what they're doing good, a little bit of a coaching session on anything that can be improved, and then we shift the focus off of them, and what can you what can I improve? And then we take it back to the processes. now we're ending on it. It's not a personal note, and then you can just end completely on. Again, you've done an amazing job at these things. Good job, looking forward, you know, to the next one, keep up the good work, that kind of thing so that you can kind of purposely direct the energy almost like conduct, like a music conductor. Right? You purposely starting in a specific spot and ending on a specific note so that it has the the best positive income and doesn't have like any kind of negative impact on the day. Even if there's a coaching session, you kind of take the heat off with making, putting some attention on you and just the business in general. Yeah. Okay. So you have your weekly standup meetings. What is the format of those or what you didn't call them standup, but you We can team meetings. What is the format of that?
00:50:04 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Typically, if I have something that I want to like an urgent thing, I'll usually bring that up first. But most of the time, we kind of just, you know, they have any concerns about certain cases or like a question, I'll just ask them like on any specific cases you guys want to go over. Um, you know, anything that, because if it's like really urgent, obviously we talk about it like right then and there, like else you just message me or come into my office. So the meetings are more things like that come up, but they're not like super urgent. For example, I'm trying to think of an example. Like there was one, there were like denying liabilities, like a word for word to spew. So LC asked me, know, how should we, you know, approach this case? And they know, I tell her, you know, how I would do it. And then for Cynthia, typically, you know, Oscar, are there doctors that are giving you issues on, you know, record requests, are they taken too long? That way I can, you know, reach out personally and try to get it done faster. Sometimes we'll change like how we do things in those meetings. For example, like, I don't know if you know what the health insurance liens are, but Cynthia typically handled those and a few meetings ago. So typically what they'll do is they'll send a form for us to fill out. But I realized when I would do it, I would just call a number. and give them the info that they wanted over the phone and it was much quicker so like in the meeting I was you know advice and they're like hey I tried this because it served responsibly to get those in I was like you know let's try just every time we get one of those requests just call them and give them the info instead of you know filling out the paper faxing him back so in the meetings like if you want to change something how we do things you know we'll go over that in the meetings and then just like general questions like you know are you guys overwhelmed like I always ask Elsie because I know she takes like 90 percent of the phone calls I'll ask her like are you overwhelmed like are you able to are you handling everything do you need me to you know take a few calls this week to you if we get a lot of cases obviously she's gonna make a lot of calls so I Ask her if she needs any help. Typically she's she's able to handle everything. But yeah, let's typically have the meetings go.
00:53:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And are they scheduled regularly?
00:53:18 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
No, there's no set date to just kind of just I'll just let them know like are you all available for meeting like at 3pm on a certain day or something. But I don't have like a set date yet.
00:53:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So do you for sure have them every week?
00:53:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
I mean, we've missed a few weeks like sporadically. But I always talk to them like in the office like they'll talk to us in our office. Cynthia too. But I should probably have like a set date every week to do them.
00:53:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you learn this in the military, right? there is real power in structure because no way. to expect, you can anticipate it, which means you can be better prepared for it, right?
00:54:06 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
00:54:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And generally, when we're better prepared for something, the outcome is better. So my recommendation would be to go ahead and schedule that as ideal of the time as you can, where it is a set time every week, and then, you know, if somebody gets hung up on a call or whatever, then you modify it if need be, but do everything you can not to modify it. And at worst case scenario, you know, everybody stands by if they can for a little bit, or more importantly, what should happen because the only only way that that's not controllable is if there's an inbound call that took a really long time, but even still call control skills can kind of probably help with that. So, like, one of their things would be don't make a call, you know, 30 minutes or so, or don't take a call, 15 minutes or so. before the meeting so that nobody gets stuck on a call, make sure that we can show up and be prepared. then the meeting can have a similar structure to the reviews, not necessarily the same stuff, but a very specific structure. One thing I would recommend is start with the winds. It always kind of helps the mood and the energy, especially if everybody knows that's where we're starting. We're not going to dive right into stress. We're going to say, hey, because I know you're watching your team anyway, right? Hey, you did this good. You did this good. So Cynthia can now start getting her weekly kudos and you could say, Cynthia, you're killing that at this, this, this, you're doing a great job. Thank you. Even if you have to get into the issues, eventually where it comes up like, oh, also I'd like you to work on this type of thing. It started off with the wind and you can end with, you know, again, here's how I can support you kind of thing, which is something you're already doing. So start with the wind. and then you could either get two concerns or questions or the urgent thing. You might kind of play around with that a little bit and find out how that works because here's the thing, you're at the meeting, it's going to get handled. Where it falls in the meeting isn't as important to anything other than the energy of the meeting. So you kind of want to put it where where I like, again, energy sandwiches. I think we talked about these a little bit. I don't remember if we did or not. Good things, bad things, then good things, sandwich. So that's something to think about. And just because it's urgent doesn't necessarily mean it's bad and it may be top of mine and they want to get to the issue quickly. and when still, they don't have to be long winded. want to keep everything as 16th as possible because nobody loves just having meetings. for the sake of meanings. So get in, celebrate the wins, get those kudos, you can do urgent thing, or the concerns or questions, and maybe a concerns or questions specifically for Cynthia, and then concerns and questions specifically for Elsie, and then is there anything that I can do to support you, and then just wrap it up and have a set time. So 20 minutes, 15, 20 minutes, probably is all you need, maybe even less depending on how complicated it is, and also if your team is doing a great job of communicating all week long as the issues arise, you don't want to save it for the meaning. Your business doesn't work that way. So they really should be able to be pretty short. The biggest thing is those urgent things if it's on a planned schedule, right? Because you can definitely have have a we needed meeting to get on the same page. right now and so forth, and that wouldn't be the same thing. The structure would be different. That would just be simply a resolution call, right? But this call, if there's an urgent thing that gets brought to the call, then probably it's already been discussed and you're just, you know, getting to the nitty-gritty of it, and basically getting clarity. So those types of conversations, if and so that dialogue back and forth verbally is what allows for that clarity to happen. So other than that, 15, 20 minutes really should wrap it up, and then they know, especially Cynthia, because I think that she really needs that feedback and she really needs that interaction, especially from what I learned about Lorenz, and she really needs that encouragement. That can be a great time for her to do it, but she also seems to respond well to coaching, especially the way that you're doing. doing it so that gives her everything that she needs and now we start compounding that happening every week and then monthly they get one-on-ones it's a little bit more detailed about specific stats we look at this six months from now I and I don't know when you're gonna hit that incentive period where you guys really get to just kind of blow things up but I think your trajectory is gonna be amazing I think that that consistency and that structure based on what you told me about how you've already applied some structure and accountability but also just support I think I think that you'll probably have some pretty stellar results that you'll notice yeah I'm open to that and everybody else has like structured days I just it's weird like sometimes I'll notice like the beginning of the week is kind of slow
01:00:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
So, I'm like, I don't want to do my meeting on like a Monday and everything happens and then we have to wait till Monday to like have another meeting. But I'm thinking like Thursday would be good because we have our firm meetings out Wednesdays.
01:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you can also have like a Monday morning email that you send out to everyone if you want to that maybe you dropped it on Sunday night and it's just maybe kind of stayed at the union. Hey, this is where we're at. These are our priorities. We'll have our meeting on Thursday and it could just what you could do is take. So let's say you use like an AI recorder or something or use a record and then and put it in the eyes so you can get some notes, have somebody taking notes. Somebody needs to take notes for sure. Otherwise, it's kind of pointless because you want to be able to track the conversations and you want to track the results because if you don't have data, you're not tracking anything, you're giving it to. human error, which there's going to be human error anyway, but it kind of diminishes the power of those conversations when you're not really tracking what's happening from them. So, somebody taking notes really well or use a recorder, and I can show you how to give it to an AI so they can summarize for you, something like that if you want. If you're nerdy, I'm sure you figure it out yourself. So, but I would recommend doing that. And then you can take those notes, instead of sending them out after the call on Thursday or after meeting because you're in person. Monday, hey, here's a recap of our meeting notes. you know, anything that might have happened between Thursday and Sunday night or Monday morning whenever you send it, you can say, here's a quick little update on a specific case or issue or whatever. And just go team go and we'll, we'll meet on Thursday, let me know if there's anything urgent and then you deal with the urgent things as they come up, but those three structure points. So we're talking about monthly one-on-ones, weekly scheduled meetings, Monday, kind of recap of the call and just additional support, clarity, prioritization, that kind of thing. If you have then something that comes up urgent, just tell them. If something comes up urgent, into my office, let's have a call, let's do whatever, let's meet and get it worked out so that it gets moved and processed and it's not weighing heavily on you or anything like that. And if everything else is being managed well and optimized, you should have the freedom to be able to deal with those types of fires and really give it focused energy so that you can handle it. So additional meetings are totally okay. If you want them, if you need them, but the structure and the committed time just kind of helps everybody say alert and focused and accountable with them, you know? Yep. Okay, so let me know how it goes. It's always a plan to start with it. The reality is everybody's a little different, the teams are different, the feedback is different, but what we do want to do is at least give it a chance to work because week to week, everybody's going through different things, feeling different things, different things happen, that type of thing. So if we could commit to this weekly schedule for at least three months, try to be as committed and consistent as possible. If you're just like, it's really networking, this is a problem, this is not the best way to do it, then let's change it up. the odds are that the structure is definitely going to be more beneficial than not.
01:03:51 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah, I agree.
01:03:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I hope you're so glad that you're having these conversations. You didn't answer. just left. Well, you're back and I just bombarded you with a lot of things. But what I would like to know is, and maybe give you some time to think about it, is come back and let me know and you can send me an email. I'd rather not wait until the next one on one. But how you felt about this call, and I think that that's something I need to do. So I'll send you notes about what we talked about and what we're going to work on. But then I would love some feedback from you like, okay, this was useful. This isn't really what I'm looking for. That type of thing so that I can structure this for your best benefit as well. Okay. All right. Do you have any questions?
01:04:54 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
I don't. excited to go back to the office tomorrow and close out the month strong.
01:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I think you're going to do amazing. I'm oh, it's so weird to get emotional about dumb things sometimes. It's not dumb. I like seeing winners win, but I like seeing good people win, especially. And I think that you're on a great track. I think that it's you've got some amazing qualities on a personal level, on a professional level. And I'm really excited to see your career evolve with Sweet Law, because I think that you've got some special qualities that are really good.
01:05:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Well, thank you. I appreciate that. Like I said, I enjoy the meetings because I'm the type of person that'll just pull my head on work and not really talk about certain things. it's good to kind of have you as somebody I can balance ideas off or someone to tell me, know, you should try this because I'm always open to that.
01:05:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would love to be the sounding board too, because I'm sure that you have ideas like that. I know your brain is working, you're just really quiet about it, because you're one of those that like, don't talk about it, about it, you just give about it. sometimes like, you know, that's the general rule for the general population, right? But you always have like your internal people that you should and could kind of talk about and riff with. And I know you've been like the lone wolf, but I'll tell you like, I'm 47, I'm about to be 48. I was always the very lone wolf independent, I can do better by myself, whatever. But I'm learning that as you, the bigger you grow and the more you increase your stewardship, right, the bigger teams are, or the more that you have maybe leadership roles in other parts of life, whether it be parenting or coaching or heading up some type of organization or whatever starting your or whatever to do. Being able to tap into other people's strengths, having conversations, peer-to-peer, mentor-to-mentor, or peer-to-mentor that students to mentor, my brain, it's Monday, anyway, but, but getting in the practice of not talking about all things to all people, not being like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, that drives me nuts, too.
01:07:25 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
01:07:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But really, you just kind of like, I'm trying to figure out the best word to use, but just contemplating, but kind of co-consomplating, know what I mean, riffing back and forth about what you have stewardship over with somebody that has some kind of understanding about it, and it doesn't necessarily need to be the same type of industry, but leadership to leadership, right? Management to management could be law-to-law, that type of thing. So, just because you're still young and bringing these things in and you'll find that there's just a handful, like you'll be lucky if you get even five of those type of people that you can really, really, really be open with throughout your life. But when you find them, talk about what's in your head because the feedback that you'll get will be very different when you're not just listening but when you're really actively participating and sharing what you think and what even you might feel about some stuff. So anyway, that's just my encouragement to not hold back, not to change how you are quiet, had down things like that. But in small moments, just kind of engage a little bit more at a higher level from time to time and only with specific people so that you can really develop your own leadership at a higher level, because I think that, like I said, I think that you've got innate leadership qualities and that whole iron sharpened iron kind of thing. It's there something to it.
01:09:15 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
01:09:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:09:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
would you say sorry as a thankfully, Mark, you know, has you as a tool to help all of us and Yeah, really appreciate it.
01:09:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm glad to do it. I really enjoy it. So anyway, I won't take any more of any more of your time any calm down Another call. Anyway, I hope you have a great day. I'm glad you're back from vacation. I look forward to your report I will send you this email. Maybe not until tomorrow because I have some things. I want to add to it But it but it will be there and then we'll follow up next week Sounds good. All right, you have a great week. Thank you. You too. Thanks. Bye

painting so it's got my gosh you're so cute yeah yeah I just I even have a picture of me in the car we I painted an old Honda Civic in my parents garage right pink bold pink with oil based house paint and a paintbrush and put a big red vinyl sticker I got made on the sides saying pinky student painting I decided to pull pink to cover the first objection in a blue color town I was raised in of well can a woman really climb a ladder and paint the exterior of my home so I figured just go with that objection and shout to the world that yeah we are women pinky and we're pink I love that yeah yeah so I obviously saw a lot to continue but I was also realizing because you like frameworks and stuff I have a really good framework graphic that I did a while that I think you're gonna love figure out how to just model after that too and some of the stuff we're doing but basically When I sold my social media certification program, I kind of channeled some of the stuff I learned from all the business process of re-engineering and SAP consulting jobs that I did with computer sciences, all that stuff. So basically we made like a really good, say me, but Tommy got half of my ex-husband because he's, he was a consultant too, but we made this really good, what's that?
00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was the voxer thing I just got was from you, I don't know why I just sent it again.
00:01:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anyway, sorry. Oh, no, we're zeroes. So, social media, social certification methodology.
00:01:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just remembered that I made that graphic when I was like, up late.
00:01:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know it was really good, yeah, So, let me just share screen, I'm still looking for, I called it fast-track for social media, media, sort of methodology, and I, all the people that paid $2,000. to the course I got certified, I allowed them to use all of that and the white peppers I created and stuff. So I was realizing that like I gave a lot of good back then that I don't feel I'm elevating this time around that I definitely should. So that's what's good about doing this. Fast track. Let's see if this comes up. copy of Fast Track methodology. Do you see this? My social sales accelerator methodology is this?
00:02:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh it's beautiful.
00:02:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so it was blues. I actually looked like I did for maybe my social sales thing because I just modified it. But the original one is through a loop. So let me see if that comes up. If not, it's in my other Gmail account because I had an old Gmail account that I was using. Oh, that's actually really social.
00:02:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the yellow and gray is the other combination that works really well and you can think of of Amazon. Amazon uses those colors. are some like, yes, yeah, yeah, gray brown, you know, UPS, brown, brown gold, but gold and blue and often they're used together, but those are powerful colors and the gray and black are kind of elite level, right? Which is why Amazon, I mean, in the beginning, um, and even so, they, they've got so much to them, Brown, but UPS, corporate, corporate kind of thing.
00:03:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So here it is. Like, this is the whole webinar presentation at the end of a challenge. I like someone coaching room and, you know, um, that was a review.
00:03:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
love to do a webinar together.
00:03:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We have to get some offers and this is what we're working towards.
00:03:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. I was thinking about it last night and I was, you know, in my prayers and stuff and after, especially after you were consulting and I'm not consulting. I'm asking about the scaling question, I'm just talking to Heavenly Father and I'm like, know, because here's the thing, Maria, like, I'm not trying to build a legacy business, I never have my love is always like, can you protect your brand? got to this? I'm like, babe, this is not my calling forever. This is what I'm doing now, like, I'm, I'm running a book called the prosperity complex. And it talks about, and it's very much the same premise as give a man a fish versus feed a man. feed a manifesting, teach him how to fish, that kind of thing. But it's that you don't solve poverty by giving money. You don't solve poverty by redirecting money or donating or things like that. solve poverty by making self-provident people. And when my babies are grown, all I want to do is go visit my family and my friends, my loves. And I want to strengthen them and I want to teach them skills. I would love to go to Africa. I'd love to go to that any country even do it here, but teach people the same way that I serve my clients just every day people that would never have a chance to learn it because there are so many skills. We figured out lemonade stands where we're kids, know, and mowing lawns like kids can do it. So there are grown people who could completely change their communities if they have somebody just say, number one, you can do it. Here's how you can do it and here's the simplest way to do it because most people don't teach that part, right? that's what I want. So in the meantime, what I'm doing now, I just want to serve God through my people, through my kids, my business, by helping them do that right be self-provident. The money that I need to help people because I have to teach how to fish, but also feed fish until they can
00:06:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
learn, right?
00:06:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so I've got that responsibility and the income that I need and want to generate. But I want to have joy in it and I want to bring joy in. I was just thinking in terms of that scalable, I still think that us spending our time with a few high level clients, and this is the diversification that I've been saying about from the beginning, right? that you don't have just one offer, you have a few offers, you have one that's like really high level that pays well but also gives you the experience of keeping your soft, super sharp and really understanding the businesses inside and out. also because it's a high level client, having higher level expansive mind expanding conversations, right? And then you take it back to the lower levels and just showing up in a community. and me teaching people, nurturing them, loving them and helping them make money. I'm like, that's so like joy for a few years while I finished raising my baby and we making plans with whatever extra money we're doing because one of the things I wanted to do is have my money work for me. And like I imagine the compounding effect of us working together for a few years if you were interested in it and building an off ramp where you do whatever you wanted to do because you've got the money that you do whatever you want to do you can do it because of purpose or and likewise and not that I would just like disappear because when I keep people I keep people forever so there's that but anyway I just thought how much joy would it be to just share community and serve them and love them and teach them the marketing and the business and but also to feed off of their thoughts it's not like we're there are going to be people that are smarter than us in some ways you know sorry did you say something?
00:08:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I had to say Alexa stop. had an alarm for an hour, but I already did it. It was to put the rice back in the fridge. Sometimes I pre-cook rice for dinner.
00:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've gotten lazy and I buy the ones you can just steam in 90 seconds.
00:08:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I have those too. I have lots of those too, but I got a rice cooker.

Nice. Montreal chicken season.

But the kiddos are gone. Amanda's on Thomas. He's doing his master's in speech pathology, and yeah, and he His girlfriend, he just started dating about eight months ago, so this is like the third week and they've come down now So it's kind of really fun having them here So we had a dinner with them on Sunday Just us and then to my family my mom and my brother and sister all and her brother stuff We had a big family and yesterday at their house It was not a good and it was funny because me and a man were talking about our eyes are always so much bigger than everything Because we went to the liquor store thinking oh we're gonna have all this booze for everyone and stuff But all this wine really nice bottles of wine like god will be ever heard of decoy that red.

00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the weekend and I was like, when I was 18, I got blackout drunk a couple of times and the fact that I could drink so much, probably also had some marijuana, but drink so much that I first of all, I thought my body was explode and I peed all over myself.
00:10:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So there was that.
00:10:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I didn't remember what I did and when I was told what I did and the way that I behaved was just rude. And I was like, I need to not, and I'm not, I don't do anything by halves. So if I'm on drink, I'm on. So religion or not, I just need to not be a drinker.
00:10:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, it's funny. Um, yeah. So, so it was, yeah, it was really good. So, so yeah. So, but when I, right, I almost like was going to vox you the few hours later saying, Oh, wait, no, disregard the message about these offers and scaling because I realized the first step is you need the pedigree and all my courses use that and then we'll figure out from there. so anyways, that's why. I backed off unboxing you because I'm like, oh, I got to get this done for you.
00:11:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For us. Yeah. Because I really, what I think it's just going to do is make attracting people and make our marketing so much easier.
00:11:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:11:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's not just what you've accomplished, but it's your path of evolution. And so you're not just showing somebody that, look, this is where I am. And this is the success I have now. Like, I got here in steps because everybody has to get where they're going in steps. You don't leapfrog for the most part. So the other thing is I specifically for you is I think that you had forgotten how great you were. Like you knew it, but the details of it every time you would tell the story, you'd be like, I forgot that. And I had paid attention to the fact that you kept saying you forgot that. And so I wanted you to really remember, but also because you've attracted these people and they start to got a connection with you and low ticket and in their mind, maybe lower value, that needs to be corrected. The second part of it was what's your library of content, like what have you created because from that, and you have way more than me to bring to the table, as far as I'm concerned. Way more experience, in terms of volume, the thing that I think that I do the best is that mine has always been leveraged. My effective hourly rate has stayed high for a long time. I've worked very, very little and still done really, really well, but in terms of volume of clients, because I work so little, I don't have a vast experience and I didn't make as much money myself. So I have earned over a million dollars over a few years of coaching, which is you. But I'm less impressive, between your library and your pedigree, that will help convert people a lot. I'm more impressive when you talk to me, more impressive than you. mean, more impressive as a person, but I don't really feel like mine. There are some accomplishments that people go, wow, I think, but I think I just have less of them.
00:13:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, and the thing is what you'll find about all my stuff, you look at it all, that probably if I stuck to one of those, I would be in a far different position right now. Because I totally realized that, look at Amy Portafield, like she had, I remember when she first, like I used to be a search term on Google, like people, like I'm sorry on Facebook ads, you know, interest. So back in the day. So, so, and that was before Amy Portafield even existed. And then she came out with her podcast and all this stuff. And then she, but she stuck with it. Like, yeah, she had webinars that convert. That was her. first thing, but then she converted to Digital Course Academy, and she stuck with it. Like all this time, or look at Brooke Castillo, the life coach school, like she stuck with it. Yeah, she's going through whatever changes she's going through right now, but she like, so I think that was my biggest downfall because probably if I stuck with just the social media certification, because that social media is still hot now, then it was like years ago, but this whole webinar, after the challenge selling this, because you know, they even got a certificate.
00:14:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This was back in 2000.
00:14:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Wow. Yeah, this back in 2011 for social media was huge. So I could have been like the, what's that other gal? The blonde here that wears the turquoise blue all the time.
00:14:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mary, Mary, she's glazer.
00:14:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I like her too. No, she's the Facebook queen, Facebook loves her, and got her to speak a lot on the Facebook stages. Mary, I forget. Anyway, so I'll come to my mind, but But this whole thing took a hell of a lot of work to create.
00:15:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How do I have stesses, lot of testimonials.
00:15:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I think it was probably just because with divorcing Rudy and everything since I felt he helped me create behind the scenes this. Maybe, so he was sort of like that Tony Robbins on my shoulder and a really motivational. Yeah, maybe I just felt. now. Yeah, yeah, so maybe with that I just felt I didn't really want. Well, so something I'm a shiny object. want new technology. Everyone's doing social media now. So let me do something different, but like this, you know, this is all really good graphics and stuff.
00:15:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
know we can update it to 2000, you know, 24 terms, but still this was like really damn good. So think about though is that because I've beaten myself up for the jumping around and things that I do, but I'm a generalist. I'm not a specialist. I do have specialized skills and to me, that is leverage and it is simplicity. But it's even those are general type terms, right? They can be applied universally with benefit. But the value that you have in having all of that experience is that the nuance of your knowledge and understanding, one of the greatest assets I have brought to companies that I manage their operations and the way that one of the reasons I was able to get them to grow so well wasn't just my structure. It was my liaising between the different departments because I knew them because I'd done their jobs. I've done copy, I've done graphics, I've done development, not to the same level, but I knew enough to know your program lying to you about how hard this is or how long this takes or how much it costs. fire him. them or fire me because I'm not going to keep putting up with this attitude and him holding everybody else back and things got fixed. But because I understood every aspect of the business, top to bottom, left to right, diagonally, my ability to manage it really well, that's where it came from because I done the jobs. So you understand like multi-channel marketing in a whole new kind of way. You understand the ins and outs of the channels. You know how to leverage a single channel, but you know so many things. Now at this season in life, it may behoove you to stay more focused in a particular realm. the realm can be a realm of slightly ambiguous generality so that still explore nuance. So, for example, with business systems, teams operations, these are the things I talk about. I get to play with technology because systems and technology go hand in hand.
00:18:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, that's a whole lot of shiny that I get to play with.
00:18:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And yeah, I mean, that's the biggest thing, technology in terms of project management in terms of automations for customer in terms knowledge and connection and even customer nurturing with the automation, right? So not just acquiring, but nurturing and extracting everything you can out of each customer and increasing the lifetime value, but making that reciprocal and creating the nurturing that gives everything you can back into the customer. That's a lot of shiny for me. That's fun because there's so many different, you know, like AI, all. these different things. But also the psychology of how to do that. So I get to study marketing psychology and I get to study leadership, which is more shiny to me because I love like Adam Grant and I love Robert Chaldini. And those are shiny for me because there's a new thing and I'm like, ooh, what happens if I apply here? But it's still like I've been doing systems. Everybody knows me as a systems person, which has kind of been detrimental to me because I'm way more than that, but that's where put their heads around.
00:19:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
your copy, your marketing, adult productivity as well.
00:19:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, everything. Yeah, mindset. Yeah. So anyway, I do also have to leave at like 1145 because my daughter is home and she needs me to take her to school.
00:19:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I've got a hard stop in 20 minutes. And I'm really sad because I don't want to talk about all these things. That's okay. Hey, we'll have tomorrow, too. Well, let me update you couple of things. I haven't said anything to Joe, but I can. I can just kind of respond and say, look, Joe, oh, yeah, we've been, sorry, we've also been swamped with other people that want to hire our services for kind of what we have. So we're going to, we don't have a bandwidth right now to help you, but just, you know, and just leave it like that, you know, nice.
00:20:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you can say whatever. I still think that like it's not even necessary, that you do have other people interested in talking to you, but just the, the message I said might be too blunt for you. I don't know if you remember it on boxers.
00:20:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
was long. I thought it was quite long. That's the only thing I thought.
00:20:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's totally possible to you.
00:20:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But it's so funny. It's totally possible. Let's see. Let's see. Boxer. I thought it left an opening for her to actually still hire us.
00:21:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, yes, she wanted to do the pocket CMOC.
00:21:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, but I know she won't. No, she won't because she's asked us a lot more of free.
00:21:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Exactly.
00:21:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Uh.
00:21:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You just do search hi, Joe, but it's to be right above that.
00:21:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know how to search in Boxer.
00:21:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right up there.
00:21:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Where?
00:21:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where's the search? Search chat title titles. It's just as titles.
00:21:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Never mind. Yeah.
00:21:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You should do control F though.
00:21:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Uh, just Joe.
00:21:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi, Joe, maybe there it is for Joe.
00:21:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
At least that. Not think about it or apply. might send him this. We have to have all that we said that you want to call your man. I just mentioned we have managed on this one to test where you get it with this offer. Yeah, that's why I thought no, because I think she's still going to be unhappy. Don't you think, if she buys the CMO, pocket CMO, COO, don't you think she's going to be there?
00:22:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
won't buy it.
00:22:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, so just leave it like this then, because you know she's not going to buy it? because she won't buy it, because you still gave her the window, but she's not going to buy it. Okay, okay. Okay. Go through all your . for a of I know I laughed little bit when she said, well, plus the percentages, that's $250,000. thinking, it's $250,000 and nothing, because it doesn't have it's too risky whether we'll get it.
00:22:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was one of the other causes of mine in Rudy's divorce. the other part of this being long is it's tedious, guess what she's been, tedious.
00:22:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes. All right. Oh. So it's from you, the software that Marie and I put out. So did you want to respond to her with this?
00:23:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
can do that.
00:23:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I can be the .
00:23:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:23:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. you do that, yeah, because I've got good news. I got three strong candidates in the pipeline for, yeah. So remember that one guy that we drafted the scope for Grant Mueller? He did pay $1,000. He actually said send me the pay public. So then he said, I'm looking to start this Friday. I know it's your Canadian Thanksgiving. So I said, OK, well, let's all get together with all to send you some information after Thanksgiving. And so by Friday, he gives me access to his account. Is that then I'll send him the other invoice for $4,000? So that's $5,000 a month. So that's good. And then you know who came out of the blue. And again, there's a lot of lurkers, I guess, in the NHB board stuff was I don't know you know. But he's a pretty big player in the manifestation niche. Um, oh my god. He does affirmations Let me go to Facebook get you know us Noah St.
00:24:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is that it that's when you said Noah that was the name of pop to my head that I don't know him I just know the name.
00:24:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah Ditto I think ages ago one of my colleagues did some work for him before he was famous And I know I think I may have consulted him like I'm talking 15 years ago Off for an hour about social media strategy, but that was way back in the day So he so I don't think he knows Recognize that was me because I think it was through a colleague, but um, yeah, that was when he was nothing now look at him So yeah, so he's interested So I'm gonna talk to him tomorrow afternoon. We arrange a call for tomorrow afternoon So nothing's determined yet or anything and then there's another guy that wants to do He also is from NHB Allen's group. He used to have a yoga, the modern yoga.com brand. He sold it off, so it sailed and go that well because the urnout that I was supposed to be paid by the new owners never really came. And that's typical. That's happened to me too when I sold one, something before. And so he said, but he did with that company, he helped yoga instructors establish courses online and sell stuff online and basically do webinar funnels. He said, so I have funnels that really work and I'd really like to get into recurring revenue of Go High Level. So he wants to create a low ticket product that can then put people into Go High Level. Basically giving away that $10,000 course that he used to have. Basically it was given away. So I've been talking him back and forth and I said, I'm simply giving away. You should just create a little take a funnel with that, right? then it blah blah blah. So anyway, he actually is pretty serious as well, but he's in Thailand right now on vacation or something. So we're going to chat tomorrow morning briefly and see if there's any legs. for him, I did tell him $20,000. So yeah.
00:26:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:26:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So we'll have to figure this all out if this all comes fruition because remember, we haven't got an agreement yet, but there are certain aspects where I think initially, I don't mind getting the money coming into me for cash flow of the one client, Brett Mueller. But for the others, if we want to take them, I'd rather see maybe the money going to you in the US, because in Canada, well, they're not Canadian, so it's not an issue. If a Canadian pays me, it's paying me because you got to pay HST because I have an HST license, which is harmonized sales tax, then you got to charge them GST. like GST is like 13%. So if they buy 20,000 from you, you have to add an extra 30% tax or else the government's going to come to me for it. So it's way better for you also taking the money into your US entity and all that jazz.
00:26:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I do not know enough about anything in structure, but so how Um, do you get, um, like, is there a different type of payment? So, so like we have employment, self employment tax, and then we have personal tax. So like if the company gets paid a certain amount, that's one thing. And if I as a person get paid a certain amount, that's a different thing, they're taxed differently. So like, how would that work for you? is it just that, um, I would take it and then pay you, and just because you're getting reduced amount, you're not having to pay that initial 13%. So it stays the tax.
00:27:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
how does that work? No, well, well, first of all, like I was mentioning this so that you get money as well. Like this is part of the joint venture because you're helping, you know, with those other clients, like if that's why I would say that, um, those, these warm clients, it doesn't really matter if they're not living in Canada.
00:27:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't charge only if they're in Canada.
00:27:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Do you have to charge 30% like as long as they're anywhere else in the world, it's not an issue. So that's why like 99% of my clients are outside of Canada. I really don't like having Canadian clients don't really, they take too long to make a decision. First of all, they're very conservative, add the Canadian dollar, I want to get paid in the U.S.
00:28:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like what I did with Creed is like I would just invoice her, you make money and then whatever the amount, I'll just invoice her.
00:28:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And so I'm like a consultant to you that you're, you're paying, but it's sort of, I'm just thinking down the road because I don't, you know, let's just say if like 20k comes in in the next like 30 days, I want you to have some of that. So that's kind of where that's coming from too.
00:28:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're good to team.
00:28:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That are going to get emotional. Yeah.
00:28:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like you making everybody else money, but like it's good to be able to take care of my people too, you know? Yeah. I, it would be great. And I got to tell you like the gratitude that you do marketing because that's the thing. I don't, I don't whatever. We've had these conversations before. It's just not, I'm ambivert and I really withdraw a lot. Now, to serve is a whole different thing, the marketing aspect of it just drains me. I love the service and I love the work and showing up and getting to do that. And if we could bring in a few high level clients that we could serve really well together. And then if we could siphon off enough time to work on a smaller offer that's scalable, I really think it would be joyful to serve a community together and just to teach people and to love them and to serve them. I think that we'd feel blessed. think we're much as given much as required, know, and God has blessed us with really strong personalities and minds and hearts. And I just know that the world needs it and all the good people. that are out there, there's not enough of them serving. So anyway, I just, I feel happy borrowing joy from the future in the hope knowing that we're building this and just getting to talk to you every day to makes me happy.
00:30:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm really good.
00:30:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm borrowed joy from the future. So to me, when you worry, you borrow pain from the past.
00:30:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But when you hope you borrow joy from the future. Wow. When you worry, you borrow pain from the past.
00:30:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. Yeah. I heard a phrase once that is don't go borrowing troubles. I think it's a, you know, a black thing that I heard. But then I realized that one of my powers has always been even as a kid is, I live in the present, but I always borrow energy from the future that I'm creating. I live in that moment, as though it's the reality. you know, as I got older, it's the kind of a law of attraction, you know, things like, like, it's already happened. And that was never a concept to me, but if actually it had, because I felt it. And I felt the reality of it strongly enough that it brought me joy and energy. So that's what I think about. Like, I can literally borrow energy from a future that doesn't even exist right now of all the infinite possibilities with hope. And it makes me happy in the now.
00:31:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love it.
00:31:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get to talk to you.
00:31:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
just, every time I'm saying my present, it's just so hey, what trellible. board are you thinking of that that would be part of the scope? said, we'll make them a trellibor so they're responsible for their own data, which I love because as an agency with Emily Hirsch, like we'd always provide them Friday stats, but very few clients I've read it, they'd have no clue still and then you know what I mean? Like I loved your whole thought process of they know what the heck we're doing so they get the value of what they've invested in.
00:32:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yay, let me see if I can find the template that I used to use for base camp because we can start with that. Course creator template bundle? is that? Oh no, that's campa. But I could even create one from scratch because I've done it so many times. I feel like I found it and showed it to you and drive. was a, I think I probably have a few of them, but we, it would be fresh because I don't have anything in Trello. But basically, So, you know, and we can do most of this in our sleep probably, and as we've had conversations and talking about implementation, I rattle off this step, this step, this step, this step, that's what we've done. So basically what you do is you, we could put multiple boards in Trello. So let's say you're launching a new digital offer. And so in there, you would have a copy section and a graphic section and a development section, and then a marketing section, because these are all the pieces that go together. So the first thing that has to happen is the offer has to be created, and then market research has to be done before you can give it to a copywriter or the copywriter is doing it.
00:33:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's an assignment.
00:33:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So, and then you define does that offer match, right? market research and offer creation. kind of it's kind of a circle like chicken and egg kind of thing one can happen before the other but then you need to go reiterate based based on what you find. So then it goes to copy and then the graphic designer really needs the copy before he can put you know graphics together because there's the verbiage that goes on to the e-books or the ad graphics or whatever. The developer needs the copy and the graphic to landing page, opt-in, So then you've got the developmental operations on that side but then you also add the copy if there's a you know abandoned cart sequence. there's a nurturing sequence after they opt in to send them to a sale where they purchase the sale and then there's a you know follow up or they're upset like all of these things have to be mapped out so all of that could be put into a project management suite and so not only do they wrap their whole heads around it but they could literally just change the title slightly assign a person put a due date and one of the things we can do and talk about is like you know you should expect about this much time for this process to happen if you're doing it well and if you've hired it well you can get this accomplished for roughly this amount of time and money and then we could also pair that up with the PTE maximizer right profit time energy maximizer and go like look make your decisions based off of what you already know here if you're going to hire somebody you know we one of the things we did was your effective hourly rate so who are we hiring or are you doing it Are you writing the copy? you doing the development? Are you putting your name in there? That may be the case because sometimes we've got more time than we have money. Even if we have almost no time, you might be dear money. Anyway, so no matter who we're serving, even when I go on to people who have made millions of dollars, most of them don't have project management suites and they don't have that. So people, so your lurkers, if we do some screenshots of some of this stuff, and it doesn't matter if people steal it, so what? There's enough for us, we don't need everybody to buy from us. We just need enough people to buy from us. We'll make sure that happens if we're out there surfing, so we don't need to worry about who steals and he tries to whatever. You can't take with mine. He won't let you, so whatever. Yeah, so as people, and there will be lurkers who will sometimes, especially if we don't have a high ticket cost where they can come in and check out everything, they'll go on to be like. like Dan does that all the time, Dan Ryan, he goes and buys people stuff and then he goes and hires them for a very long time and gives them a lot of money because he's like, yeah, all your stuff.
00:37:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You're super smart. How do I get you?
00:37:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, I think that that could be a massive value, especially if on top of that they get access to being able to show up on our weekly calls or ask questions in a group or whatever. And then they start to the questions inspire more questions and more answers. So one person asked the questions that somebody else didn't even know to think and ask about. And then they're all like, oh, and I'm like, well, yeah, I didn't think about teaching you about that. But I could teach you about that. you know, like it all just feeds and builds upon itself. And it could be very lucrative, very quickly, because you don't find a pair like you and me just in there.
00:37:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, I agree. So but this is specific for like say Grant, right? Like he's probably We're going to want to see some thing happening in Trello.
00:38:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if you put it up, we would just have one of our conversations, you and me, or even them. And I've just set it up and build it, build it, manage it, run it, do like just do operations, plus support you in marketing, basically, whatever is needed to show up, because the faster we do it, and I, there's also the saying many hands make light work. Like, it'll just be easier.
00:38:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. And what's cool is that he's probably out of the three. He's the best guy to start with, because he's already got a low ticket funnel started. He just doesn't have a good order bump. He doesn't have enough cell one, doesn't have enough cell two. So he really just needs the refinement versus the other two will be starting something from scratch and a little bit harder to get momentum. But yeah, this would be good.
00:38:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if you sell anybody and we work together and I get paid, here's what you should know about me.
00:38:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Everybody's business like it's own.
00:39:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to come in and nurture the crap out of it and offer it to serve. also mindful of not stepping on toes. don't need to be the star of the show. I don't need to be ego. Like, we had the conversation with Joe. Like, I talked, I'll lead, but I'm not trying, but I don't need to dominate. I don't need it. You know what I mean? And it's important to know that because sometimes you work with people and you're like, they just, you know, like they got it to go and they want to make it about them.
00:39:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't care. I care about you.
00:39:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I care about how you feel at the end of everything more than I'll care about them.
00:39:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. And I'm kind of the same. you know, I've probably give too much to their company, right? yeah. so, I hope I had to be ego more 12 years ago, but I think my ego sort of more humbled out. I was a jerk.
00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was.
00:40:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Okay. So, uh, yeah. So let's just play by your about the other ones. Um, the other two, but I think Grant's in if he made the pause unless he chickens out, we'll see. And then we'll go from there.
00:40:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know you got to go soon. I do. I wanted to. I was so excited. I'm a nerd about like I'm a five year old about this graphic that I made.
00:40:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes.
00:40:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I made it. I'm like, it kind of actually reminds me of one of my client's images. I'm like, did I mentally steal something that we've used before?
00:40:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, because it's, no, because it's, it's very similar to the Emily Hirsch one and I'm the intellectual property creator of that.
00:40:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, I'm excited. can exist still for a while. As we had, oh, so the colors are blue and orange. That still exists. Am I on that page still? I'm still on there.
00:40:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, my gosh.
00:40:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What?
00:41:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Show me.
00:41:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, sure, sure.
00:41:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You'll learn.
00:41:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sure screen, sure screen. I went to LA for this photo shoot.
00:41:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, sure.
00:41:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not the right thing.
00:41:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's the website.
00:41:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
D4Ybrandbuilder.com. D4Y. Yeah, I turned that into a seven figure agency within month. And then he just destroyed it by taking our too many clients too fast.
00:41:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:41:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that's it.
00:41:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Are you in the about? No, so on the home page, there's D4Y and there's a laptop. There's Arthur and I'm to the left of him. Oh, yeah, there you go. And there's .com secrets. Why did he show .com secrets just for the branding?
00:41:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's just for what he calls them. Arthur is something else. Oh, brand recognition. see that. like, yeah, he didn't work with them or anything, but he follows that stuff. Competitive analysis, value letter design, strategic evolution, community build-outs, social media management, email marketing, and I ran everything in that company.
00:42:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, well.
00:42:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Services, let's see what they have for clients. Oh, nature select. I forgot about that. Our rows forgot about them too. Gymnast, whatever. Anyway, we had, we had a graphic and it was kind of like the value letter design. And I feel like after I saw this, I'm like, it seems similar to some D for Y stuff, but I don't remember. Anyway, but Yeah, but it was inspired with the Emily, her stuff, but also for sure.
00:43:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've created other graphics and had graphics.
00:43:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where's the Canva thing? But, um, what, what I actually liked and what I kept like reiterating is the right thing. Nope, that's not the right thing. Canva design. I'll just go home. Oh my gosh. I just made my thing go away. My daughter don't reply to me.
00:43:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
She's probably like passed out.
00:43:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It takes lunch anyway at school. She doesn't have to be there right now. But what I kept working on is, and it seems like it wouldn't be that much because there's not actually that much here. But this, whatever we put into here. This is what I think is unique is replicating the will determine maintainable cost and pace of scaling.
00:43:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't think people really think about that much and I don't think.
00:44:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if I in implementing complimentary or supplementary offers based on customer feedback, and so that's all the more looking at data, but, but I think that so like this could be a whole kind of PDF and then the next one like break down day zero through 90 and much more detail and 90 through 80 and much more detail, like each of the faces in more detail. So people go like, that's a lot to be giving to me to walk me through to help me do. Um, like I think that we can make amazing webinar slides out of this. Yeah, agree. Easy on the eyes. think it looks professional. I was kind of proud of this.
00:44:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think it looks amazing. Can you share that with me? Yeah. Yeah.
00:44:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't share the link.
00:44:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You, you know, it says only you could. Yeah. I think I was going to say. You probably thought of Oh, is this like the done for you brand builder only because it's the blue and the Orange gold. Yeah, I think that's the only similarities So and if you're unsure about that we could change growth Nope, I'm not changing nothing. I've built most that anyway. Yeah, got it Yeah, no, love all this because also this can just be repeatable to sell to other people who want to start an Agency and then that's how we could make recurring revenue. think from go high level because then we can Give them a snapshot of the website that includes the methodology things. Maybe we create some white papers for them Share some case studies they could use It's taking what I did for social media certification, but doing it for like Agencies or entrepreneurs or something.
00:45:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yes So the snapshots can match up with the projects all set in a way in the in the template Mm-hmm Yeah, anyway, and I do think I think that so the thing that I was thinking is that the visual representation, and I think I sent that in the message, but you know, I'll go do a quick search marketing campaign, low chart, there's tons of these.
00:46:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
How come your computer just got really small mobile sized.
00:46:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Yeah, there. So, like, we could make versions of this with our colors and branding. Oh, yeah. But we can make variations of this. what it would look like to launch a main product or relaunch or add an order bump into the mix or upsell or whatever or turn it into a recurring revenue. you had a one off at all, you had this high ticket, like, yeah, how you, you know, so anyway.
00:46:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, no, I get it, Ravi Abubala was good at that using Lucidchart. He, I think, sold a lot of his initial class. Science because he showed a damn good flow chart of stuff. Um, yeah, I have an account for them but I never really used it a lot.
00:47:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I never use it, but I have it and I'm like, you know what? Ryan?
00:47:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Did you buy it way back in the days when it was like, yeah, me too.
00:47:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:47:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. I think that produces great flow charts.
00:47:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Some people use Miro now too, M-I-R Mind. Yeah. Mindjet. Um, what's another one? Yeah, there's one to the man. There's flowy something like that.
00:47:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's right. Yeah.
00:47:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
then the Giffy even G-I-O. Giffy. Giffy. That's the one that Dan has built our org charts with. Yeah. yeah, org charts, like some super basic org charts, like two team org charts and like really show what they're doing. Yeah. How it evolves into three, five, 10, 20 and how You know, you can have a multi seven figure business with a five person team and it's not that difficult. If you do it, right?
00:48:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You can have a multi what business seven figure seven figure. They're right down to maybe that's our slogan Multi seven figure business no one says that Yeah, well, that's my ears perked up because everyone's like here's how to have a six figure business six figure six months I know sounds people like it. They're good hooks, but that's unique You can have a multi seven figure business with a five person team like it's very specific.
00:48:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like that Yeah, I mean, I've worked to them There are lots of them, but they're not Vanking noise on social media.
00:48:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They're just living their lives. Well, we can also say you can have a multi six figure business with a three person team or two Yeah, two person team.
00:48:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, three or or 1.5 right and One is a two point five and the other one's a two point five because and so yeah We can have a whole webinar of team structure and what you could do with that and talking about Operations and teams and going through my profit time energy maximizing go. This is this is what this looks like when when everything is leveraged So I should go wake up my daughter.
00:49:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think she probably passed.
00:49:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm feeling good But she's trying to keep up with school, so okay, I'll let you make let me um, so we'll meet tomorrow I would love to have an agenda for calls as often as we can if we can start getting that slow with that Yeah, I think we're always productive and really good, but as we're tightening it into specific Yeah, um things that we want to accomplish so you're working on the the pedigree and Putting stuff together, and I think we're kind of mentally I think if we put the main focus towards getting a couple of high high-end clients that we
00:50:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
can work on serving together.
00:50:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there's money to build things with and then the time there we will be spending time actually fulfilling that and the rest of it we can be like okay now we've got some assets to work with. Let's build a simple funnel with what we have and that's where our previous trainings will come in and then maybe we just do some live webinar trainings and build content out of that. Something to think about but anyway. So tomorrow let's just pick it up from where we're at right now and then put the intention out that within the next couple weeks try to create agendas for each of our

Hello.
00:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hello. How are you guys saying? Good.
00:00:17 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
How are you?
00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Theotic but good. It's pretty much always chaos. I kind of like it that way though. My daughter's got me a hat that says Boss of the Chaos.
00:00:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You're one of those people that tries in chaos?
00:00:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Not really but I do take some joy in it from time to time and then I like 15% chaos and the rest of it is recovering from the chaos. But it's like a battery pack for me. I'm just like I don't want people. I don't want people. people. And then I get to my people and I'm like, Oh, like the sun and, and then I go home, I'm like, what did I say? What did I do? I just want to like relax and what to be or read or do like whatever work out. I have to get the physical energy out of me. Where's my Patrick? got my Lorenz. Where's my Patrick? Beyond Tom being anti social. This is not okay. Yeah, he might be on a call. I suppose we could tolerate that.
00:01:33 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Let's see.
00:01:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sweet. Oh, what's been well, actually, how, how, how is everybody recovering at home?

Yeah.
00:01:55 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And my wife, she's starting a steroid injections this week.
00:02:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, hopefully that will help. mean, they're powerful. Let's see. Why is my windows not open? she is she mentally coming out of it a little bit? Like, that's a lot to go through again and Yeah.
00:02:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
She's strange.
00:02:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. Good. Adversity is like that. It doesn't matter what it is. It's always this. It's a fog and it's almost like a echo chamber of misery like this. Give you a ribbon in the house of mirrors.
00:02:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:02:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Everything is reflected back to and it's like nothing else exists. But then you get out of it and you're in the real world again. I feel like adversity can be like that sometimes and trauma can be like that. We're like, everything that's in you is what's reflected back to you constantly. if everything that's in you is hurting. That's, that's all. your experiences and then all of sudden you come out of it and yeah so um what's up Patrick hello how you doing you get to fade on yeah I get it every week yeah what do you think I look like with a fade I'm already annoyed by how short my hair is right now all right okay um wait Lorenz remind me how old your kids are uh fourteen twelve nine and five are they excited for Trunka treating you guys do that well yeah we do Trunka treat then we do the our our neighborhood goes all out on Halloween's and yes my we do it we're doing a chili cook off next Wednesday and my kids are fourteen and seventeen but they're still hooking it up and dressing up and yeah yeah my wife told my fourteen-year-old that he was two
00:04:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
to, uh, to dress up and I was like, don't you dare, right?
00:04:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, no, no, there's, there's no such thing.
00:04:09 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Maybe this might be the last one for him.
00:04:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, it wasn't that one. No, it a Viking. I was like, what?
00:04:17 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Last, last year he dressed up as Maverick from Top Gun.
00:04:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice.
00:04:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Got a lot of girls looking out and I'm pretty excited about that.
00:04:27 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
That'd be the cost.
00:04:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Smooth, right? It has me like, what? That takes that out. That's funny. All right. So anybody been thinking about what we were talking about last week? Do you remember what we were talking about last week? I'm like, you paused Lorenz because it was your idea you brought us a table. Patrick, what were we talking about last week?
00:04:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Using Slack to find a way to organize tasks and checklists for the teams to go through. Only get cases.
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So did you happen to have any thoughts about that after the fact?
00:05:07 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I think it would be helpful, but I would try to keep it as basic as possible. Because I feel like everybody has their own little thing that you can add. If we created an Excel spreadsheet and send it around the firm, I feel like it would just get very, very long as far as what everyone thinks should be on there. But I think a general checklist is good because we just get so many cases, or if somebody needs to step up, maybe they're not used to doing certain roles. And they can just kind of see what needs to be done at a certain stage. Yeah.
00:05:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How about you to run any thoughts about it since last week?
00:05:52 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, so actually Slack does have a function task manager function. That's built-in, it's called lists. And you can use the project manager template. And it allows you to assign tasks to people, track the progress, can be working comments on it. It's pretty neat. I've been using it, rolling it out is going to take a little bit of time just because I have to create a new list, essentially, for each client. And I tried to do it during our review meetings. That's taking a little bit too long to do that, to do that live. So I'm going to make some time, I already scheduled some time during soccer practice on Thursday night to get going on those. But yeah, I agree with Patrick. Pretty simple. Otherwise, it just becomes another Mesh like we had with little I when I first came where every time You know a new a new case came on we have 22 emails and 22 tasks and It's just oh no one looked at him. So and The good thing with that is that you can Schedule tasks out So it's not all due today. It's not like and so And you can Grade the importance of the task so that if they don't get to it they can Get to it tomorrow Good.
00:07:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I talked to Mark about it and he said that Lidify has workflow automation also and so we are gonna get on a meeting only I'm going to get to be able to be there too and we want to talk to somebody there about slack and see because the remember I told you this is going to be an iterative process. It'll be for the same reason that you talked about Patrick and also Lorenz is that we don't want to create more problems than it solves.
00:08:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
We don't want to create a bottleneck that wasn't there before.
00:08:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, or just overwhelm. The whole point is to improve efficiencies, not to create more more tasks, more issues, more noise. So it will probably be wrong the first time to three or four. So that's where we need your leadership and having conversations with the team in working through it and be like just use it, tell me what's wrong, what doesn't work, so that we can fix it. This isn't, we are going to do something and you're going to do it. like it or not. Like we're exploring growth and innovation to improve and the specific goal is to improve efficiency but mentally as well. So we've got this entire lag time of task switching, right? And we have this list of basically 20 tasks that have to be accomplished across hundreds of cases. Your volume isn't quite there yet, Patrick, but it will be. And the goal is to increase the volume for everyone. So that scale, you know, there's a ceiling somewhere as to how much we can accomplish and how much we can do well, as well as what's the quality of life day to day for us doing the business. know, our human resources are everything. There is no business without human beings. And we all have emotions and we have limitations and things like that. So just a reminder, the goal of the system is to optimize for the human resources, right? It isn't prioritizing the task so much as the person who is completing the task and kind of building the Iron Man suit around them so it has to be compatible. Now, it is not going to be equally compatible with all people on the team. That's just the way it is because we're all different but we do need to be fairly consistent. Where we can make alterations per person without breaking a system, we will look for those opportunities and I want you to always be thinking about that and working with people. the alteration is just your approach. in getting them to use it, understanding what their intrinsic drivers and motivators are and how you can align what already drives them with the system and how the system can support what is driving them. Does that make sense? So you can keep exploring if you want to right now but maybe don't go whole hog on it right now till we have the conversation with the litify experts. Right, want to invest a ton of time into this if it's going to be a different system anyway. Yes, because so there's a couple of things that are going on. So we've been talking about reports this is kind of an ongoing process mostly due to the fact that we have a lack of frequency and conversations. So which reminds me, I got to follow up. So A lot of it goes through email. have infrequent touches throughout the week trying to work with a guy who works on the little by reports, and then we need to have a same page meeting, but also Mark was a lot like there's just a lot going on. So the pace of this is kind of slow, and I want to come back to that in a minute to talk about what you guys need to do in order to create and maintain and potentially increase momentum. In the meantime, but so we've got the person who creates reports who is not litify, he actually works his brothers and attorney, and they have a firm and so he's nerdy and was figuring it out for himself because litify is not great at reporting. They build this infrastructure, but it doesn't work well. It's very clunky. I don't expect them to be a whole lot better when it comes to the automations, but because Mark pays a ton of money. That's where he wants to start is having conversation with them. And if I get to be there, then I'm going to probe a whole lot and see what we can do. And then the other thing I'll do is take that back to our reporting guy who's also been digging into Letify and see what we can do. So this is probably going to take a couple of months to even get to one like version one that is any kind of really useful. So I want you to kind of put that in perspective. And then additionally, we're going to have a conversation with Slack and because Slack knows Slack really well, Letify knows Letify really well. The two of them know each other a little bit probably, but being able to talk to the experts on each one and then come back and come back to you guys and create that version. The way that the conversations are spread out, we're probably looking at a couple of months as a time frame, essentially 90 days. Roughly, the first iteration of every type of project happens between 60 and 90 days, almost consistently across the board. So keep that in mind. In the meantime, I always like a quick and dirty version of the system and it starts with just awareness. So we have the one spreadsheet that we created, which is all the types of tasks that have to be done per case, and who works on them, right? And then just touching the cases and looking at it and making sure we are on track. So that mostly comes down to file review and scanning quickly. So this is what I want to talk to you guys about. How has that been going for you? love to hear from kind of forensically, like low level forensically. that in terms of what's been happening, what's the anatomy of the case, like our list is basically the anatomy of the case, right? so we know that there is kind of an order of operations, something can happen simultaneously, and that we decided on a particular amount of frequency that for sure nobody should be going even a week without at least getting a text message like, hey, just checking in with you. How is all of that going for you?
00:15:28 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
That's good. mean, basically when you do the file review, it's like our list, but you're just doing it kind of in your head or you have something that's basically what you're doing. You're making sure that, you know, based on how long we've had the case, certain things have been done or are pending to be done. So that's what I do. I go through and say, okay, this case, we just got it and so called done, okay, insurance request, liver, insurance, set up a treatment. basically what it's going to be for like the newer cases, middle of the case, usually it's about treatment if they're going to continue or if it's been done and it's a negotiation and I already know about that. And then the really old ones, it's more so usually me just negotiating, it's just taking a while or that's to go to litigation or something. So it's good, I still have to remind the team. Like if I see they haven't been contacted for a while, I'll just send a text message. I'm not like coming, send a task to the team and then wait for them to get it when I'm already in there. I can just send a quick text as the attorney and maybe that'll give the client a little bit more, you know, peace of mind. But it's good. Obviously things fall and get missed but that's why we're doing file reviews. don't think it's an optional task for the attorneys. I think Did we mandatory for everybody to do it? Because these are our cases at the end of the day. I personally like just a piece of mind knowing what's going on with each case.
00:17:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And do you feel like you have a better hold on your job and your team since looking at it that way?
00:17:24 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Looking at it, how?
00:17:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see, looking at all the cases with that kind of frequency, looking at it with a list you've come up with knowing that these are all the things that have to happen, and then looking at the timeline of these things happening. So if I understand correctly, the pace for both of you have improved, and that level of detail didn't exist to the way that it does at the moment, even a couple of months ago. Am I right about that?
00:18:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I'm sure more so for me because the more experience you get, the quicker you are knowing what needs to be done at a certain stage.
00:18:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the question is, how do you feel like do you feel like you have a better understanding and grasp of your team, which is basically a business within a business, business? Do you feel like that's improving because of the way that you are forerenzically looking at everything?
00:18:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
If I just think, let's say I didn't do any file reviews, it would probably be a nightmare on these cases because if no one's poking and saying, hey, what's going on with this is likely just going to keep going the way it is, if there hasn't been contact for three months, it's likely going to go on for five months, six months. So, yeah, I think now that, I mean, the team knows, like, I mess up. to lc daily cases hey where's this where's that so they know that it's being monitored i think that's another um kind of like way to remind them to do what they're supposed to do because eventually i'm going to go look and ask them hey what happened here um because you know when i started to mark a screen in my cases that's kind of how he would do it to me so um i was like well let me make sure like knowing somebody's looking over here it's older huh yeah i mean it's for the better right i mean these are all our cases and you know i'm not going to sit here and just delegate tasks and not do anything like so negotiate so well especially not if you want to be topped up right yeah like can't like give up control like i still write my own demands there's a difference between delegation and abdication that's the to you if you fail
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's still on me. I'm coming for you Education so application is I'm giving you all the power and It happens in business all the time. So for like in the world that I have a lot of times I'm working with very small companies. They work from home. They've been multi-million dollar A big deal but marketing is the life and blood of the business if there are no customers. There is no business So it doesn't matter how great your fulfillment is it doesn't matter how great your team is it doesn't matter how great your product is If nobody's buying there is no business if everybody's buying and you suck at fulfillment They're still some business. So What will happen though is a person, you know who's been just exhausted with having to do it all for so long hire some and they're like, oh, you're smart, just do it. Like, I'm throwing money at you, lots and lots of money, do a good job, that's not how that works. Money is not generally enough of a motivator for most people to do excellence. comes intrinsically, it comes internally, it comes from something that drives a person. The person who is driven to excellence will be driven to excellence, even if there's no external reward. That's the thing about intrinsic motivation. They're driven by something inside of them that requires them to show up and be the best they can. They're competing, even if there's no prize for competing and just knowing that they're the best, that intrinsic motivation keeps them going. You know what I'm saying? So when we have teams that we manage, getting somebody to do the job in order to help us reach the goal. whether it's a team goal or the internal goal, but generally it's gonna be an alignment of both, right? You have your own drive. It's probably not everybody else's goal to the level that it is yours to be top part in the company. They might be like, yeah, that sounds cool, but they're probably not thinking about it as much as you're thinking about it. They're probably not hungry for it the way that you're hungry for it, right? get a paycheck, I'm not the attorney. So to give somebody a task and expect them to be thinking about it and prioritize it and organize and structure their day and to be disciplined about it to the level that you would doesn't make any sense. And so you wanna make sure that you don't abdicate, give them full responsibility and ownership over everything. You hope that they will rise to the occasion and you hope that they will want that as much as you do but the reason. ideas people generally don't show up like that. So you do have to always keep your eye on all the things all the time. You are going to be the leader. There will be one leader. Now there can be co-leaders, right? But at the end of the day, only one person is accountable for all things. That will be you, each of you. So looking at that and being able to break it down, Lorenz, how do you feel like your just kind of grasp of things, the traction, how the team is behaving, like just what are what's the thing that you might have observed as we've been going into this? going to keep using the word forensically more because it's, you see, I think of forensics, think of looking at the like the anatomy, what's the makeup, like, what do you call it though? Magnifying the last like really Inspecting every detail rather than you know 30,000 foot view to like microscopic view, right? Um, that's how we've been really digging into stuff. How do you feel like that is having an impact? Um, mentoring day to day operations all that.
00:24:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, uh, You know, I'm the kind of person that's never happy. Uh, I always want more.
00:24:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Never happy or never satisfied.
00:24:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
They're too very different. Never, never satisfied. I always, I always want more, always demand more of myself and my team. But, and so I have to kind of force myself to look at the 10,000 foot view and see which direction we're going. You know, we are going upward. momentum is upward and forwards. And so that's, I like to see that. I like to see that there's improvements every week. It's not, we're not leveling out, we're not plateauing. But yeah, of course I want to speed things up. I want to do more. I want bigger settlements. want to go from 20 demands a month to 40 demands a month. I want to, I want all my clients to, I want to figure out a way for all my clients to do their recommended injections, because that's what's going to help them feel better and get better settlement numbers for them. So I'm always, I'm always looking, I can't, when my wife and I sit down to watch TV at night, I have my laptop on my lap, trying to figure out new solutions and new ways to look at things. So, I don't You got some competitor in you, I see, I see you. I don't really worry about.
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What other people are doing because I can't control that but yeah, that's I mean really that's the only competitor you actually have cuz You're the only person that is made with the same skills and the same stuff like Improving and beating your best is I mean like I said, it's it's the only true like experiment Because everything if you're looking at a scientific method right then you isolate the variables that means only one variable is Only one thing is actually variable everything else is fixed So but when you're competing against else there's infinite variables you you can't there's nothing else. So You would be That's anyway, that's it. I gotta capture this real quick. So you need to Need to remember that this report is wrong. It's not gonna work is it? Hold on The average resolution speed by team Is that that? Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm an integration, capture, you can see it. There we go. Because I'm looking at this again and it's weird because it has average resolution speed is less than Yeah, that doesn't make any sense. For your team, your average days to close is higher than your average days to resolution, but for everyone else, go away. The average day to close is higher. And wait a you see this? So, like, we were looking at this before. Whatever this is, be the same ratio for everyone, this number, or is it? It is higher. Hold on. There's 64. Okay. Okay. This is the right thing. So, this is total close, and this is resolved. So, this is probably paid, and this is, we came to. It got settled. Resolution's probably settled. All right. That proportion is correct. That's interesting. This disparity is pretty big. It's not a month roughly, not quite a month, but then. The speed to act. actually closed. Now it's only really a week difference. Anyway, these are the targets. So this is last 90 days. Let's do the first quarter. Or for the gimme, let's see, equals last quarter is roughly the last 90 days. I don't want that. We'll just do this here. I feel like that number was higher, so, too many one. All right, Lorenz, keep track of your number and Sam's number, 319, 291, Patrick, keep track of your number. Even though we know that that's skewed and Tyler's number 301. So I'm gonna switch it back to 90 days real quick It's got it Yeah That's weird I would not expect that to go up, but it did for everybody I think In the last 90 days, I wonder how that report pulls data Hmm any thoughts guys Maybe like increasing cases Yeah, that's a significant jump though, so for Lorenz it was 346 versus what? three twenty three nineteen three nineteen so twenty seven days so less than a month but still that's a month and then Samantha's number change to you remember what her the number one I feel like it was like 200 something yeah hers was like two ninety something okay and then Tyler let's go switch that back again one more time and it was this year so let's everything up till now so three nineteen yep and then hers was two ninety one so she's roughly 20 day difference higher which is about what yours is right friends yeah and then Tyler's what was Tyler's is he's went down No, that should probably do. It's just an easy, different window side by side. Real one, watch out, 281. Okay, yeah, so here's one up. Here's one. Oh yeah, he did the opposite. So this actually went down. This is 90 days. Well, and where's the volume?
00:32:25 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Although I don't think that would be such a bad thing because it's across the board, we're all getting clients to get more procedures than they normally would have before. It will naturally extend the time it takes to resolve.
00:32:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is definitely true. Do you feel like that's happening?
00:32:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
It is for my team. I remember getting like two injections was like, were aired for my case book, but now like happens very frequently.
00:32:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How about you, Lorenz? Is that happening for you?
00:33:01 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I'm getting good value out of my cases higher higher policy limits the Still struggling with my Hispanic clients, but actually I've been digging down with with Mike and Karen who's kind of a newcomer to the team and We're we parents been able to cases that are in negotiations right now She's been able to convince the clients to go back and do the injection so it can get more value out of the cases Yeah, we've had it for 10 days and she's already been able to change three clients minds a I'm wondering if Jessica just just because he's a little bit more shy and I'm not it's not the right word, but like she's not very like assertive when she's talking to clients. I wonder if she's not able to kind of like make them see the light, make them see that this is in their best interest.
00:34:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So and that comes down to training in the same way that it's adjacent anyway to the same kind of conversation you had with Viri helping her to feel more confident and open up to you.
00:34:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's just kind of interesting because Jessica used to be kind of the superstar on the team. She used to be like the the CM where you know she just runs with it and now I'm like okay I think we have to do a little bit a little bit of retraining because it's kind of throwing me off a little bit and management.
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is so important, because again, human resources, things happen. People can go through traumatic experiences that can shake them. They could just have a really bad experience with a call. They can become apathetic. There's multiple reasons why somebody would pull back professionally or professionally in certain arenas. And so these are things that you want to try to discover in your monthly meetings with your team. You're one on one, right, where you can dig a little bit deeper. But also you always want to be paying attention to what people are talking about. You want to be paying attention to their tone and to their body language and be aware of what kind of day you're having. Mark, when we're on our calls, it's almost never on video. I can tell instantly what kind of day he's having, by the way that he says hello. Not everybody is going to pick up all those things. That is a particular skill set. But just being intentional about watching and observing how your team is doing is going to be helpful and impactful. The other thing is training, but knowing that you're watching things, knowing that you're measuring things, all of these things have an impact on how people perform as well as things that are happening in their outside lives, you know, at home and other things that they're going through. So even though traumatic things can happen, difficult things can happen, sometimes even mental disorders and struggles, just anxiety. to me, it's odd to call that disorder because that's just life for the majority of people. And whether or not debilitating, still can feel like disability. and disorder, you know, makes it seem like it's a disability, whereas reduced is all it takes to create a quality of life issue and a satisfaction issue and stress and not being able to sleep, which then has a compounding effect of all the problems because we're not sleeping good. It's so easy for like everything is related, you know, so as you're observing these things and looking at who's doing what and how and you might notice in this contrast that this person used to do better, used to do worse, whatever, you just want to address that as as a leader, as a manager, but more specifically as a leader, managers, know, manage, leaving is a whole different kind of thing. It's being interested in in the person and caring about the outcome for the company, but also for the person. anyway, I would love every week if you guys are noticing things, you know, about about your teams, about performance, bring that stuff so you can kind of brainstorm about it. what now that you have this awareness, Lorenz, what is your timeline? is your plan for doing something about what you've observed?
00:38:26 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, well, I've got a couple of things cooking. Number one, Jessica was she was preparing and playing her own wedding for the last couple of months. And so she just got back, she took two weeks to go on her honeymoon and she just got back yesterday. So I'm gonna, you know, kind of meet with her probably at the end of the week to kind of see how she's done, how she's doing. The second thing is, I'm gonna be, as soon as John is going on a paternity leave, well, any day now, whenever the baby comes. And so that's gonna be for two weeks, so she's gonna be subbing in for John as a CM. when John comes back, I'm gonna put her back in with Jessica. Heron is a very experienced CM. She did nine errors at Sweet James. And she knows her stuff really, really well. And so she can help, she already helped. She helped me go through Jessica's cases and kind of bring them up to date. And she's gonna help Jessica shoulder some of the load and get her back on track if there's any burnout or anything like that. Trying to get her, you know, I think it's... If there is burnout, if this is a burnout situation, it might be good to like give her a little bit more, give her some confidence by offering some help from an experienced CM who can shoulder some of that load that she might feel overwhelmed by.
00:40:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that awareness. So I have lots of different thoughts about that. The first thing I'll say is that it's important to be aware when somebody shifts into a box ticking scenario, okay? Box ticking is, I did it, right? It's not how good I did it, how well I did it, it's just I did it. So somebody went through a divorce on the team and was definitely not showing up for a while and the numbers were showing on that team for a while and then all of a sudden that person noticed the dip in the paycheck and they're like, I got to fix this. There are different things that people can be aware of when they're going through stuff. So again, human resources, some of it has to be tolerated, but not without effort. So you can know that you're going to give somebody space for what they're going through in their life, but that doesn't mean that you don't call them up to be aware of the fact that they're not operating at the same level. So one of the things that you can do is be like, when you're here, I need you to be here. That doesn't mean you're not still giving them space for the fact that they may not be able to be fully there. So it's almost that you're doing two things that are at odds with each other. It's not. It's that you're doing your best. to pull them up in the middle of what they're going through, but knowing that it's a request, it's not a demand and a punishment. So the approach is what makes the difference. So sometimes we simply just need to be conscious of the fact that we're not being present and be told that we need to be present. Sometimes really that's all it takes. You'd be like, Jessica, you know, we really should be pushing for this. You used to do that, you're not doing it. I know that you're getting married. know your best stuff in your mind. While you're on these types of phone calls, can you try to be conscious of not taking the box and just being like, I had this call, but make that call be what it's supposed to be. And knowing that that phone call is actually the outcome of the case and how much we get paid, which is the whole purpose of this business, but also it's your job. for that person to make sure that they're getting the best care and the most care that they need to because once the case is closed even if they have any residual issues they're probably not getting taken care of and now it's out of pocket so you have duty to that person sometimes just helping people be aware like hey we're slipping a little bit I know you got stuff going on but I need you to try to do better that's different than you're slipping fix it or else you know what I mean you're still giving them space for being human and also saying do be conscious and try so just keep that tuck that under your hat the other thing is burnout okay so once you get to burnout burnout can be very difficult to recover from it's different for everybody so the first thing that you try to do is proactively avoid it one of those things is really about how we spend our time during the day. I think I talked to you guys about energy services, right? Right, doing the hard things, doing the good thing, doing the good things, hard things, the good things, right? So that's one of the things to being able to talk to people about how they manage their energy and making sure that your team members are energy conscious, right? Because so many of us have, we have people in our lives that are energy vampires, we have things in our lives that are energy vampires, they just drain us, right? But if we're on autopilot, which when people are stressed out and overwhelmed, autopilot kind of kicks in, there's actually a psychological term for it. And it's like called default, default system, I can't remember what it's called Lawrence, you started study psychology, didn't you?
00:44:55 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, like 20 years ago.
00:45:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is the auto-pilot machine psychology, automatic processing? Yeah, automatic processing. rushing a T-thread. it's like, have you ever just, like, faded out and you're like, I don't even know what just happened over the last five minutes because you were zoning out, but you actually were doing something, you can be driving. That's called automatic processing, what most of us would refer to as auto-pilot. It can happen. A person can be on a call talking to a client and be in the automatic processing mode because they're not being conscious about what they're doing. So, when they're overwhelmed and stressed, that is what happened. It's kind of a defense mechanism also to deal with stress and anxiety and overwhelm. But it also happens when we're doing things monotonously. So, if you are not, this comes back to the motivation and the entrance. motivation. If when you show up, you're like, I got things to accomplish. I'm not just taking boxes, but like, I'm trying to be top dog around here. I'm trying to not get fired. I'm trying to not be stressed out. I'm trying to whatever it is, right? There's something driving you that is important that you're thinking about, not just like, this is the next task I got to do. Okay, did that? You know what I mean? So you'll be able to observe that you may go through those things. I'm sure you do. We all do it at some point. And your people will go through it. But just because it's the inclination doesn't need to mean that it's what actually is allowed to happen. So like, so I noticed, it kind of feels like you're taking boxes. And I know you're going through up but can we try to do better? Here is how you could do better. Don't have somebody to do better who's stressed out and overwhelmed and not give them a way to do it because if they're stressed out and overwhelmed, the mental load is what's overwhelming them as much as the physical load. So if you're asking them to try to figure out how to fix things when they're like, I'm mush, planning a wedding, going through divorce, somebody in the family being in a wreck, your brain shuts down and so even the thing that you used to be able to do on autopilot can be difficult. Your job as a leader first of all is to manage your energy the best that you can to manage your your mentality the best that you can and then to check your people and look at them and like how are they doing? How do they feel? Like what's their mood? Like get a read on them, look at their stuff. Are they On autopilot are they taking boxes or they is something meaningful to them? You know I'm saying That makes sense you guys so That is kind of that that is that is the reward of going through everything Forensics is your level of awareness becomes greater. So imagine that You're going into class for the first time and you remember those like times Like multiplication test that you would get they give you a sheet of all these different multiplication things And you and they were timed and you had to get as many down as you could before the time was up you guys both had that experience Okay At the beginning of the year and the end of the year what was the difference between those?
00:48:52 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
All right speed speed but also stress, right?
00:49:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, the first time you looked at that, palm sweating, mom spaghetti.
00:49:05 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Just kidding.
00:49:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, they're exciting.
00:49:09 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
It's like a challenge.
00:49:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. anxiety. Like, holy crap. Okay. So what's the difference at the end is experience, but it's also awareness, because what you went through that year was you learned the times tables. You learned one through 10, 11, 12, probably, and you memorize them so that the mental load was diminished because it was wrote practice. You did it on repeat so much that you didn't have to think about it. You just knew what to do. But you were thinking about it every time you went to class, you were practicing it, and you were thinking about it so much that it just became easy. So what you're doing right now is you're basically learning the times tables of your business. right? You came into it and you're looking at it and there's this overwhelm and like I got all the stuff to do. How am I going to get it done? Well, stress, anxiety, and then the end of the year is going to come where you've been like looking at one through one times two, two times three, nine times nine, eleven times eleven, all these things show up and you're like, well, I know how to solve that. I know how to make that better. I know that's going wrong. I know who's dropping the ball there. I know how to fix the fact that they're dropping the ball there. Your level of awareness has just increased exponentially. So your ability to get the work done, the same exact work at the beginning of the year versus the end of the year, right? A sheet full of all these multiplication problems and you're going to get through the end of the year and be like, I got this. My team's got this. That's what we're doing right now. So, but it doesn't happen overnight. You know, some people did really well with maybe the twos and the fours, but not so good with the sevens, right? There will be those aspects in your business, where you're like, okay, I got intro calls, but I've got distributions, where are my sevens? You know what I mean? Like, there's different aspects, your teammates are going to have different things over different types of things. But because you're looking at it, top to bottom, left to right,,000 foot, you down to the microscopic view, and because you're taking accountability and ownership and leadership, not just over the results of the business and the company, but over your people, you guys are going to get some amazing results, but you have to, once you get that awareness, you have to go solve the problem. So if you see somebody slipping, whether it be yourself or somebody else, You have to address it, and you have to teach the solution. Don't just go say fix this, do better. Let me give you some ideas and suggestions about how you could do it better. also before you even do that, ask questions. Anything going on that I'm not aware of? Because I noticed this, and I think that you're this kind of quality person. And you've had this kind of quality work, but you work. Right now it was not up to what I know you can do or have done in the past. first of all, what's going on? Is there anything you want to talk about? Anything I can help you with? And whether they do or not, at the end of the day regardless, we still have to do better because this business requires it. This is what the job is, and the job is a privilege. It is not an entitled thing, right? to earn the job to get it. You got to earn the job to keep it. So here's how you could do this and always put an emphasis on this probably be the process that will take the least amount of mental effort. Like always look for the optimized version of how they can do better without being so stressed out. So that's where our automations and workflow come in. That's where the checklist comes in and really like hey if you are struggling to even figure out like what should I be doing today which by the way guys know I was talking about earlier a quick and dirty version until we get to the automations workflow. I cannot think of a better solution. Feel free to tell me if you have better idea. But I think just a spreadsheet where we have so let me go through this real quick and it would be a big old spreadsheet and it could take a long time to go through so I don't know that maybe it's one sheet, maybe it's multiple sheets and you go by the status that the case is in, right, like the first I feel like it's roughly three months months where there's like the most of the flurry and then there's you know they're going through treatment and so we're not closed yet and then there's closed end to resolution where we're waiting for the payment. So maybe we have a tab for or open and active and then we have a tab for in treatment and then we have a tab for close but not settled or wait settled but not closed but what I think would be awesome is if we had a spreadsheet for each of you and here's all the things right and instead of who does this there's a checkbox or a status of like whether it's being done now I know you have litify and you can go through all of that here's the difference and so like I'll give you example and litify I've got reports and one of the ports gives me all the data that I want, but the way that it's laid out is linear and I can't wrap my head around the 30,000 foot view, which is what I really, really need. And so we put that into bar charts, graphs, pie charts, things like that, and in charts, so I can see what I need to see. The information is there, but if I can't mentally process it because of the way that it's laid out, if I can't process it like this, if I have to look at it, every time I have to look at it, I have to do some calculations. It's not laid out in the best way possible. So all of this is already laid out and litified. But if you can't go, scatter it and be like, very quickly, this was the last day that was touched, and this is the phase that it's in, and that lines up with what I know it should be, which you cannot do and let it by right now very well, I think. Do you think I'm wrong? Do you think you can do this and let it by well? you guys do it day to day so I sort them by category okay the case status I feel like yeah I think you can actually because I don't want to create more work but what I want to make sure that we're doing is really being able to as quickly as possible and and I feel like being able to just look at it room across the board like on track off track kind of thing which also that's something that I want to identify people about it with the workflow automations on track off track if we can have a red toggle button or green toggle button like you know Excel has conditional formatting where like if a number falls between a certain amount it'll turn red like it's a negative number You know what I'm talking about Lawrence? Okay, so like, what if let if I had this condition to where basically, let's say the last comment was longer than a week ago, red flag. So all you're doing now is looking for red or a particular status. That would be really helpful too. I want to make sure I make a note for myself to talk to a little bit about that, to see if we can have an on track, off track, on on pace, off pace, and maybe what would be cool too is if each of these could be a sub status. What do you guys think about that? Would that be helpful? But I don't know if it would be because some of them are overlapped. So maybe we punk them into groups, the ones that overlap. This. is where this kind of thinking guys is where we create the system that doesn't create more work. So really thinking about what that structure could look like, where it doesn't create more work. That takes a lot of mental effort, but it will save it in the end and it will keep us from overwhelming everybody while we're trying to figure out the system. The other thing that I'm working with, founders and CEOs. quite often we have seven and even eight bigger businesses with teams of just five. If somebody, this is phrase and one of my mentors gave me was like, happens if you get hit by a bus tomorrow? I'm like, that's terrible. I just got a shock at myself. Just even thinking about that. But when you think about the impact to the business, it's significant. For now, imagine it's you, like something happens to you and you are unable to do your job for weeks at a time, for some reason, um, you're going to have if you're conscious, you're going to have anxiety be able about what's happening. If your system is so tight that another attorney can come in and if you guys are following a relatively similar system, another attorney and your case managers, and honestly for the most part, the case managers and the assistant should be able to do pretty much everything. The biggest issue is that attorneys have liability and so you you perform at a higher level. We've had this conversation before, right? You are liable to the state, to the government for the actions that happen. Your case managers legally and your assistant legally are not liable for anything that happens in the case. have to like actually break a law. But you in terms of like just obeying the law and being compliant, you have liability. So anyway, not everybody can do everything, but for the most part, because you're pre-lit, most of this can be done by anybody else. So let's say one of you gets hit by a bus or one of your team members get hit by a bus. If running this system is so well documented and organized, and you can see where everything is at, at all times, and you know where it's at, and also you're following the same type of system to know where everything's at. God forbid anything bad happens to somebody, but life happens. Somebody else would be able to step in and go like, I know exactly where we're at, and we can all handle it. Imagine the piece that will give the person who's not able to work for a while, as well as everybody that has to work. Now nobody wants to think in such morbid terms, but... it's reality as things happen. I mean, we went through a pandemic, the whole world shut down and changed the way that it operated. This type of structure, anything that was structured like this was barely phased. So keep that in mind, we're over time, and I yacked your ears off already, you're probably like bleeding on the inside, like, okay, already, Tina, the same as alone, but whatever. I ain't apologize. I appreciate you, Tina. I love you, quiet guys. You don't have to be so quiet, but keep working on it. Keep thinking about it and bring your ideas. I don't really have any ways how you could use these processes and Or if you look at it and go, know, it would be great if I could do this, but I don't know how I could do that. Because I am going to, we are going to have that meeting. I would love to take your feature requests or functionality requests. So maybe it does exist and we just don't know how to use it to that conversation. And please be thinking about how we can use the tools that we have to go from, if we could zoom in and out from 30,000 foot view to the microscopic view, you would have a full understanding of everything all the time and the more that you understand it, the better you can manage it. And also the better that you can teach your people to use it, right? So just be thinking about what kind of structure and functions in your tools would help you to manage it more efficiently. and help your team to manage it more efficiently and bring any ideas to the table. Other than that, just keep doing the best you can and think about the kind of leader that you want to be and notice your people and take good care of them.

I'm doing great.
00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you doing? I'm good. Time like flies. feels like forever. And also yesterday that I talked to you. Like, it's always the weirdest thing to me that time just is like that.
00:00:18 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The summer going fast for the kids.
00:00:21 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh, yeah. Madeline a lake day tomorrow.
00:00:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. We always go to the beach.
00:00:34 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Pontune. Pontune? Yeah.
00:00:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And so we always go to the beach at the end. And we used to rent a boat on the lake several times, but our lake has been volcanic, I think. So there's a volcano nearby. There is lava rock all around, but it's so purec right now and the fish are dead and the lake is hot. So that map to me is as I'm not going there.
00:01:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So. Wow. Yeah. Let's say that's a new, a new one. It's a new thing to deal with volcanic.
00:01:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not for my area. I mean, because we've got Mount Rainier, Mount St. Helens, Shasta, all, you know, is Shasta is visible to me. And then the mountain by this lake is called Mount McLaughlin. So yeah, we're in the Ring of Fire.
00:01:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's right. And Mount Hood too, right?
00:01:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:01:35 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:01:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. My brother has gone snowboarding there many times. Yeah.
00:01:40 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. That was where I skied for the first time. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
00:01:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How long ago was that?
00:01:47 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh, God.
00:01:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was in college.
00:01:50 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:01:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like 99 or something.
00:01:53 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Hanging out in Oregon. Yeah. Had a buddy who moved out there. Wow. his wife and before they had a kid. No. No, they had a baby and I went and stayed with them for a week and Took me skiing, which I didn't know how to do and it was all ice So yeah, I made a I mean one run where I didn't fall Yeah, it's not as easy as it looks Now there is this business where do you own but you're kind of killing it right now Yeah, um I'm really like accepting or accepting is that the worry. Yeah, excepting we'll go with it like Getting comfortable with the idea of like Like what I like I'm good at writing. I Can I can go in to? know a legit business and I can make an impact with What I do with copywriting and I was just thinking like I always had this mentality growing up of like you know, go get a job, go work. And I was like, working is just what I know how to do. And so I, you know, I'm looking at the stuff I'm doing with Tim and the Jim and getting five grand there. And then I've got another potential client in the, that I mentioned in the conservative political space that I think it'd be a lot of fun to work with. And they're interested in meeting with me. I know them really well through Brian. So, you know, I have no idea what that budget is, but whatever if it's not them, I feel like, well, somebody else I could find to do another five grand a month. And I was just thinking like, you know, I kind of like just going in, having a really defined scope of what I'm doing, focusing on that, and getting paid, you know, feels like a really attainable at least for now, like, putting together, like, like being the face of a product, or putting something out there that I'm, that I'm selling, for, at this point, in my life, like, I feel, I feel really just comfortable selling other other people's stuff for them, like, I'll admit, like, I probably have a, a block on selling. My own stuff, especially if I'm the face of it, and I'm open to moving past that, but at the same time it's like this other skill set of just doing copywriting for people can make me get money and I enjoy it. And yeah, the idea that I was thinking, the term was like, I know how to work like a blue collar person, and you know, because that's what I grew up around, and I was like, what if I just start taking more of that mentality, like an elevated blue collar type of approach where I go and I'm a workhorse, I can still set my hours, I work, you know, five or six hours a day, and it's a manageable schedule, I still set my own hours, and So, yeah, I'm just kind of like, that feels like in the strike zone for me, um, no.
00:06:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have a hard stop at 1230 or whatever time it is for you to 30?
00:06:16 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
No, it's, no, it's 142 for me. I've got to take my dogs to the groomers at three. So, I've got, I've got like an hour. Okay.
00:06:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just want to make sure that we can go through everything, but I just want to maybe think about the language a little bit because all, all words have connotations to them. Yeah. One with blue collar is kind of grunt worker and low value. Yeah. It depends on who you're talking to, right? Amongst the blue collar people, they're like, you know, I'm innocent to work early. you know, and anybody that pays attention to the economy knows that there's a shortage of laborers, skilled laborers. But you're, so there's a couple of things to it. One is that you just, you get things done. So what I would say, and again, there's so many parallels with us in how you serve and how I serve. What I've been called, I think before I even called myself that, then it was Ryan Maran pointed it out, and it's driving. I'm a driver. get things done. I can be driving myself, driving the project, but it's the energy and the momentum behind that word, but it connotation to it.
00:07:56 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Do you know what I mean?
00:07:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. The other thing that, And I think that this is something we could probably start to help you put some meat on and create a framework, which is something I never really did well because I really kind of custom tailored around people. But now that I've been doing it for so long, I realize that there is a plan, there is a strategy like semi modules. For example, to give you is I've got principles and priorities, know, I have to go even look them up. That's how I know what they are and we go through them, but thinking about them chronologically. So principles and priorities, and then it goes into finances, and then it goes to time tracking, and then we go into project management, and then we go into teams. And then we go into hiring teams, and then it's sharp in your saw and kind of mindset and things like that. And then it's iterative, constantly, right? But the reason we kind of start there is because principles informally, priority, priority informs what gets done. And the reason we go to our finances next is because finances let you know what you need to be gunning for, what you can do, what you can't do. Then we get into time because money had to dictate what our resources are before we even think about how we spend our time. But also priorities had to be dictated before we could even think about our times, you know what I mean? So then we get into project management. Okay, now we know what's important to us, we know what we can afford, we know what we need to set as a target so that we can get to the team that we want to work on. And now we know where we're going to spend our time, let's structure it, let's get it into a project management suite. Okay, now that we've got that, who are we hiring, what's our dream team? And it could just be one person that we're starting anyway, but I do kind of have a systematic approach now. Not everybody is at the same place in that conversation has nuance of. looks a little different but really it's not and the reason that it looks different is because of values and priorities and things like that so budgets you know and things like working in front of the screen working behind the scene kind of thing you know things like what's your conversion right right how many eyeballs you're getting on your offer what is your offer how big is your audience list how many offers have you even made to them how long have they been sitting there not getting an offer um you know did you did you just give them one offer and it was way up here did you try down here did you ascend them like there's a whole lot of things that can happen kind of chronologically and so you go through that going oh you missed this spot let's come back here you missed this you know what i mean or you did this but it was we don't have clear data we have data but it wasn't well or you made this change since the last time you did this this. So systematically approaching all the things that you know how to do. Now, if you built that into a written down framework of these are all the things that I'm going to look at because you just do it automatically.
00:11:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's in your head.
00:11:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do the same things. But I haven't really up until now, which is what I'm working on. sat there and documented these are all the levers I'm always looking for in the business.
00:11:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I've been doing it in my head.
00:11:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many times that I tell you, Chris, get it out of your head. You need the document in it. So taking my own advice. But that's where your power is. So back to kind of blue collar.
00:11:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's not blue collar work.
00:11:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's power. And one of the other types of descriptions I've given is I'm a surgeon. I make surgical because I'm not going in there and like, you know, blowing everything up or I'm not pumping you full of drugs that are systemic, right? I'm going to the pain points. We are only going to fix the pain point. We're going to make the least. of damage to the body possible, right? So, and that's where, what is the word? Freedom and cash fastest path, the tip of the time, okay? Fastest path to cash and fastest path to freedom, where they intersect is where we make the most of money in the least amount of time, that's a precision cut. So, you kind of do the same thing because offers our precision cuts.
00:12:26 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:12:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We are not changing your whole business. We're not overhauling the website that you're on. We're not overhauling your tech stack. We're not overhauling your team. We're not overhauling the products that you've created. We're taking everything that you have as existing assets, if possible, and improving the offers made with the existing assets or looking for how can we repurpose the asset into, switch it, or what's a supplementary or complement. entry offer that you can make. From everything that you've ever done with Brian and everything I've seen you do for yourself and other people, those are the precision cuts that you make. So that offers, what I would love to do is just kind of go through your paragraphs section by section and kind of try to do that for you, right? Precision cuts, what can we do to improve that? I would like to talk mostly about your opportunities to make sure that because one thing I think that you can still have help with is you're an offer king except for when it comes to making your own offer as a consultant. What I would like you to do is pretend you are somebody else, okay? So you're not pitching yourself. No, like write it down and you can give him an avatar or something else if you need to mentally disconnect so that you don't. getting that ego thing. Yeah, like, I know everything about this guy. This is what he does. This is what he brings to the table. This is this business. This is how this guy is gonna just help it. And this is what it's worth. And now you're gonna make that pitch on behalf of him, which is you, right? be like, this, this is a no brainer. So if you don't have a brain and you don't So you go and look at the odds that I'm going to be able to get you a 5% lift. If I do this and you support me doing this, I mean, the odds are very small that that fails. You know, if you want to give a guarantee, you don't or in the guarantee could be, I'll say until I get that lift provided, you show up, you provide whatever you're supposed to provide that how confident I am. so I'm not going to give you a money back guarantee because that's my time. But I'll commit my time until we win because I see your stuff is that good, so I'm I'm believing in you and I'm not just asking you to believe in me, but that's how much I'm believing in your stuff is that I'll commit my time guaranteed until we get X results, right, right.
00:15:17 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
People are going to know that most people won't. Yeah, that that's a interesting mental exercise to create a software for for somebody else because I I was reading about people are doing these they call it they call it product highest services basically like design joy is the one who who really the first place I came across it is just a designer that that sells his design services for flat flat fees got a very like clear process before you buy, how it works, like, you know, I'm going to work on one thing for you at time. So that it's not like stacking up, like this is how we're going to work together type of thing. And it's like, you know, I think he's five grand a month. And then and then there are a got a list of other companies that are doing this similar model of productizing their services. I've got some copywriters who are doing that as well. And I was thinking about that around because the thing that I'm I think the thing that I'm best at is email copy. I do long form. I mean, I've written two sales letters for 10, like in really short, short order, one of them. did really well. other one, the offer wasn't as good. He's gonna end up doing a little over 10 grand on that one. But the first one, you know, he did 75 grand and that was a much stronger offer. And so yeah, I'm following what you're saying and I'm thinking about like a way to sell consulting services because I mean really like what I what I really want is to be at place where I'm investing the money that that comes in into cash flowing investments that that pay me you know eventually we'll be able to replace the income that I want to make. make. that's always been sort of what I've had in my mind of like, this is what I want to do. And the way that I've always tried to go about doing that is by trying to put myself in the role of, you know, a specific way to do business, like launching and releasing products. And which, you know, is not out of the realm of possibility for me, but just like right now in the near term, I'm, you know, Brian talks about, like, you got to follow the anecdotal evidence. And right now, the anecdotal evidence is, you know, doing these consulting gigs is bringing in cash. And so it's just got my mind thinking that maybe I need to rethink that whole The whole idea of consulting, whereas for so long, I've seen it as a time for money treadmill. But if I think in terms of a decade, like 10 years, if I were to do this for 10 years, I'm you know, after 10 years, like that's, how old is Grady? Grady's 13.
00:19:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How? How's he that old?
00:19:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:19:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's an eighth grade. Oh my gosh.
00:19:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
This year.
00:19:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, something just along those lines of what you're thinking about, and obviously everybody's different, but I find that my resistance to being out in front is shifting now that I'm getting
00:20:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
getting near the emptying nesting.
00:20:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I wonder how much of that was self-preservation was also family protection. There's a different amount of pressure, and also there's such a thing as internet famous. mean, going into a marketing conference and being recognized, that was a very long time. That was 11 years ago, 12 years ago. And I was barely online. And now, you know, the world is much smaller, and we get there faster with TikTok and YouTube. if you're going to create new content, it's going to go everywhere. So if you're a face, you're a face. And that brings a whole new level of theme that I think naturally, protectively, we don't want our families to deal with. And it does take focus away because we feel. extra level of responsibility to our fans, our audience, our customers, whatever. And they feel an entitlement to the people that they engage with like, where are you? What's going on? Like, that's a whole nother of emotional estimate that I think maybe we don't consciously think about as much as we subconsciously go. You have no, no, no needed, don't want it. And I think that we have both kind of observed that there tends to be a little bit of an ego thing that goes on with a lot of people that are faces that maybe we're trying to protect ourselves against not wanting to be that person. And that, but that has a correlation to the same thing with money. Like, when you don't have money, you tell yourself that having money is bad. And that you don't want to do it because you'll be bad. but money doesn't change people. just amplifies what they are and they get, you know, they reveal it faster. So, Anyway, the thing about the 10 years thing, Grady will be grown, Madeleine will be grown, and into college, that's a whole exit runway there, giving you guys time to, because of course you could always shorten that if you wanted to, with that plan, you're now getting them set up in new houses, going to college, that stuff's expensive, and they in a different kind of way, like really being physically present when they're little, you know, they can go off and play for a little while, but now they're like, they know if you're paying attention to them, they know if you're really invested and available and all that stuff. So anyway, here's what I love about that plan for you. That's what I love about it, but the other thing is, it comes down to the boundaries, which is the conversation we've been having a lot, right? So you used to have a habit, which I think that you're very much getting out of, which is... If I'm here, I have to take care of everything because if I see a problem, I got to fix the problem and If I see the problem I'm accountable for the problem and it should probably come out of my own pocket And because I'm a partner or you know what I mean?
00:23:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Like you took a lot of things on you that didn't belong on you.
00:23:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, sure Yes, but not just Brian. It happened in it with the lease stuff. Um, I think it happened with I want to say Tim It it one of your first consulting jobs.
00:23:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom.
00:23:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, um, yeah because I I You are prone to feel a sense of obligation to something that isn't yours and I think partly out of fear of Maybe just just because you saw it. Maybe it's just because you saw it. So you feel accountable for it Side to comprehend the value and know that you're there to help. And so I think I'm the one that has to help with everything. Anyway, I think that that's what really bogged you down the most is because you can't do all of that. You were getting paid to do all of that. And now because you've created two things, really powerful things that I don't think really existed for you before, like when we first met with Brian and anything since, until around this year, last, last whole year, not just calendar year, and that is boundaries and leverage. So a very more defined scope of support that you both expressed and kept to that that's the important part kept to you. And then the leverage was in that scope of support that also it was that I'm doing this thing specifically. That's all I'm doing. This is the power of it. this is the value of it, this is what it's supposed to bring to the table for you, for me, that like you and the business and your partners. And so, as long as you not only keep doing that but improve that, if you continue to optimize that, your capacity to consult and have an impact and continue to be paid, the other factor is that lever is only as powerful as the way it can lift and the reward it can bring. So, if the person you're working for right now that you did those sales letters, the gym, I can't think of this, that's Tim. And Tom 10, that's how I get it. impact was able to be made because of his resources, because of his instruction. So you were able to plug into something powerful. So that's the other thing is, If you're going to try to help somebody that has almost nothing as a business, it doesn't matter how powerful your step is, they don't have powerful stuff to plug into, know, a 2% increase to $200, 2% increase to $2 million is, you know what I mean? So if you take all of those things into account when you are making those offers, you know, the leverage power, the reward, and also the risk for the drain and everything, that gets mitigated and the reward gets maximized. Yeah, probably all the things you're already thinking about, but I just want to add the support to it and say yes to it.
00:26:43 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I mean, I think like I'm comfortable now with like the idea of like my minimum is, you know, at least 5 grand a month, so that, and I get there, there are a lot of ways to get But for me, I get there just mentally of like, I'm involved in, you know, a couple other things. so if I'm going to take my time to focus on something else, like it's got to be paying me this amount of money. And, and that'll serve as a, that'll serve as a nice filter for people too. But, yeah, I mean, I think, I think adding another consulting client in the other, the other unknown is with this, this tea thing. I spoke to, to Jim yesterday, and he owes me, I'll say he owes me an update by tomorrow. Apparently, the issue there is like, there's, They've got this Microsoft server that their pages are built on and the pages are not loading because of some server area, server error, so they've got this IT guy that they work with. So he's like, I'm going to get these pages up and loading this week and then I'm going to move everything over to Linux server, he's like I'm done with Microsoft. So I mean, it's a technical issue that I like that's more technical than I know what to do with when you're talking about server performance and issues.
00:28:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you said Microsoft server and I was like, what are pages, you've heard said pages, but now I'm thinking more like Windows NT or something like that. Anyway, totally irrelevant.
00:29:03 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Definitely out of Got it. Yeah. and that's, so I don't fully understand the issue, but I believe Jim, like I don't get the sense that, like he's, I don't get the sense like there's anything nefarious going on here, and it's not like they have any leverage to do anything anyway, but.
00:29:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What, now what does he do?
00:29:42 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
What's his business? So, Jim is John's son and.
00:29:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, oh, this, these are the tea. These are the tea.
00:29:53 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay. Okay.
00:29:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's something else in his business is having issues. Like, how does it, does this affect you or just says something keeping him busy?
00:30:05 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, it affects me in the sense of like these, these pages, these sales pages that John wrote. And I'm more or less copy chief, but John wrote the upsell pages. Because of whatever server issue is happening, like they're not, they're not loading. Um, so they're hosting? It, they keep using the word server. Um, it's, it sounds like, it sounds like a hosting issue.
00:30:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, okay, but, um, originally you had the T domain, you had all of that stack. Oh, well now it's on click bank, right? So can you give me the tech stack real quick? Just kind of like where it was before, where it is now, what changed?
00:30:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Um, the offer will be on click bank. So, clipping handles the payment processing, but the actual pages are your pages that you host on your own.
00:31:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you used to host your own staff, so he took over all of that now?
00:31:21 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, they, so they're not using any of the hosting that I had on the, for the tea before, because the way that we're selling the tea is, is with an existing offer that they have on, on click bank, and it's, it's called a new, new body, it's a, it's like a health and wellness fitness offer for people, loose fat, build muscle like anything, because that's John's back. ground. And so the upsell for the T is going to be shown to those buyers initially to solve the traffic issue of not having to go out and build an ad campaign to start so we can get cash flowing in that then we can reinvest back into coal traffic and that type of thing. So the click bank is handling the payment processing and then I guess the pages, the pages are not loading or they're not floating quickly enough for whatever technical reason is going on with this, they keep using the word Microsoft server. So maybe it's a server inside their hosting. I don't know what they're using.
00:33:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, or the other way around hosting on a server because every site that we have is on a server somewhere.
00:33:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right, right. So. Okay, then the. So those are the main two pieces attack the clipping payment processing in their hosting slash server that are in place and there's an issue with the hosting server. then after after the purchase happens, we're using ship station to handle the fulfillment. to, uh, to the folks up in, in Rochester.
00:34:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, just to adjust an upsell to their stuff. Mm hmm. Okay.
00:34:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. I'm click bank and they, and they have, um, you know, five to 7,000 people come through that funnel every month. So it's a, it's a good. Um, you know, it's not a huge, but it's a decent stream of traffic to put this offer in front of, and, uh, for the purposes of testing and acquiring customers, you know.
00:34:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, it depends on how much you want to be involved in, and what you want to know because your bottlenecked by this. It's not your primary business. Um, I were going to be involved at all, I would want I know, where is it hosted? Why are you using, like, is this a personal server? Is this, I mean, because there are, you know, mom and pop shop servers and hosting services. And, but you didn't specify that in a contract. And any of that type of stuff, and it behooves them to get their stuff figured out, but maybe just asking questions and making sure they're not operating in dinosaur ways, they've got optimized. And having a, you know, not a, I'm demanding things, but let's have a talk and see if you can do some better things, choose a better hosting provider, whatever, I don't know. But yeah, I mean, server issues are real, especially when you're not using a streamlined one that has a huge team that has lots of different servers that you can go to.
00:35:58 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Well, I mean, I spoke to him yesterday, spoke to Jim yesterday and, you know, I mean, I could tell he's in it like he sounded just like just done with the whole thing and ready to to move and get it fixed. he he promised me an update by Thursday, by tomorrow, and I'll I'll text him if I don't want hear from him. You know, I I just have been, I've kind of given a longer leash to them, I guess.
00:36:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
pacing comes in because there's just something you can't predict. and there was a big learning curve and then it's that's where priority comes into because if this isn't your bread and butter yeah but you got this existing asset and your priority was don't lose the asset but don't be buried by it don't have to do the marketing basically you tap into my existing resources and I get paid there's no reason not to let it take a pace that is chill as long as you can tell it's being moved along stuff is getting done maybe it's not the way you would have wanted to but 80-20 is you're barely touching it it should still end up paying you you just have to get set up but the advising you know I don't know how old they are but if you're dealing with a man and his grown son it's been around for a while probably little bit up there um yeah yeah and also I think yeah John's in his 60s and Jim is like early
00:38:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
really for you. So he's, he's around my age and, you know, they, uh, Jim is like his, um, his operations person basically. So he works with his dad on his office. Hey, who's dad?
00:38:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who's son?
00:38:21 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Uh, John, John is the dad.
00:38:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Jim is the son.
00:38:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, it's definitely moving, uh, slower than I expected, but I also, I do, I do feel like it's going to get solved here real soon. Like I talked to him yesterday about, you know, I'd really like to get this off for a live next month. Uh, do you have to knew anything? Is, well, I, I purchased, um, bunch of tea for inventory. So, you know, that's a cost I've already made and invested in, and I brought that up like 10 days ago to them when reached out, like, let's get a timeline, like, I've done so much I've invested, and that really got their attention and a lot of apologies and that kind of thing.
00:39:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are costs split, do they have to pay for half of that also?
00:39:37 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
They don't have any cash, so I took that on and I get, like, all the profit goes to pay me back off the top from the first sales.
00:39:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A couple more things real quick. Can you, so something to maybe think about is use this as an exclusive offer. Hey, we had some tech issues and we just bought inventory, so we got to move this stuff to make sure whatever. Use that because that's real. Tap into that, maybe offer a special discount, but maybe it's not really like it's the price is built into it. So it's framed that way. Maybe ask them to email offer a little bit more aggressively than they would.
00:40:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's a potential thing.
00:40:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or if that tea goes bad and it doesn't get used, it comes out of their cuts when the money does come. Just some things to think about.
00:40:45 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Yeah, mean, we we all went into like in when I agreed to. To make that investment in John was up front from the very beginning from the very first call of like. He doesn't have any money to put into this, and he's had some financial struggles. Well, that's another reason to double check on the server issue, because maybe he's cutting corners, he shouldn't be cutting and being foresighted about it. That's true.
00:41:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because especially with an older school guy, that's possible. So, you know, and that's kind of affect you, something to think about.
00:41:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, for sure.
00:41:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think it figured out there's a huge dynamic difference, though, between that and how you started with other people, especially an older gentleman, that, you know, the dynamic should be your ultimately the boss. And it started with, you know, I want this 33, no.
00:41:54 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I've got 50, they each have 25.
00:41:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's probably not really anything else to talk about that particular thing, right?
00:42:11 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I don't think so. It's just moving slowly and about connected with Jim tomorrow to get an update.
00:42:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll let you go. So with this guy working with the lead company in political conservative space, that, did we talk about that? Was that part of the, you were talking about a consulting job and making an offer? And was that what you were referencing?
00:42:45 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, this is, the company is American Target advertising. Been around for decades. Found a by guy named Richard Bigory who back in the. late 60s like he's an older dude and he is like he invented like a new category of political fundraising and that's back in the late 60s raising money for Nixon and people like that and and it's it's really kind of burst a lot of the way that political fundraising is is done today I know him through through Brian because he was in Brian's the mastermind and his right hand is a lady named Kathleen Patton who I know really well but they they recently hired a like a director of digital marketing or something like that and she her name's Marcy she's in she went through the over-delivered boot camp And that we just finished yesterday. And I just heard her mention on a call that they were gonna be hiring, looking to hire an email, a copywriter. So I just sent her an email. was like, hey, I heard you say this, are you looking for full time, time? She said, part time. So I just said, I just basically told her I'd love to put my hat in the ring, told her I knew all the people she knows. And also just shared like, I do personally feel compelled to, like I do want the Republicans to win in November. And I want to, I would love to make a contribution to that. And that's all genuine and legit. shared that with her. Cause that's stuff I usually don't share with anybody. Yeah. so in Kathleen and I have talked politics a whole lot, and so I center a whole bunch of writing samples of stuff that I've done, and they're going to reach out to schedule a call heard from her yesterday that they were going to be reviewing everything and getting it to me.
00:45:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a few things I want to point out. Think about, ask about whatever. Yeah. Number one, it's while, but we talked about the power of network and how feeding that and nurturing that brings things around when, whether it be political and having those types of allies, there's going to be a day where we're all going to have their band arms one way or another. First, we physically, whatever it's going to happen, who we know, and the the level of relationships we have when that happens for people, whether it's large scale or small community scale, something is inevitable. Some type of civil upheaval is gonna happen. So that's one thing. To just getting to have a contribution in the way things do, we have no right to complain about anything when we won't do what's in front of us, you know. So there's that, you having the agora experience, just having an awareness of how agora emails, how they market, things like that, and how that impacts politics, because there's definitely a lot of involving there, is useful and beneficial. one thing I would do is change the way you ask the question about it and frame it. And now I'll take you back to blue collar worker full time of hard time, irrelevant surgeon. What are the results that you want? What are the results that you're looking for? Now we're talking about value, but when you say full-time part-time, you're automatically putting yourself in an hourly type position, evaluating your value per hour. You don't want that ever. You want to be evaluated based on your results. So we have an existing email list, we bring about $x in sales, we're looking to make this list. This is how often we email. This is our attrition rate on the email list. Like get data, don't ask about full-time part-time, just ask about what is your current email situation.
00:47:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Can I ask you some questions first?
00:47:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'd love to have a conversation with you about this. Email is something that I have a proven truck record of and making a significant lift in sales. Bye. multiples, you know, speaking in language like that, which, you know, people, people can use and use and they do, but that's true for you. And as you dig into it and ask the numbers, you can get that. But start positioning yourself immediately. Start leveraging the words and the conversation that you use immediately. You are not the hourly worker, you are not the employee, you are not the grunt worker, you are always consultants and experts, even if you're doing the labor.
00:48:37 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I take that point. I think my, my counter to that would be that this is not like a, I mean, small company in the sense of like, it doesn't have thousands of employees, but I know it's been around for a long time. It's kind of a corporate mentality. quality. And I will showcase all the things that you're talking about on a call with them. And at the same time, I know that if I feel like if I led with that with them, that it would be skipping, I'm trying to get my foot in the door. So I know they're thinking in terms of full-time or part-time. They say we want a full-time person. would have, I would know that like, well that I can't commit to that because what they're thinking is I want somebody 40 hours a week. so knowing that they're just looking for a part-time freelancer, that's helpful because I know that and what I said is like I'd love to have a conversation with you about what you're looking for and see if I can help. So I'm just trying to get the conversation in that conversation. Once I get it, then, you know, I can shift their understanding of what this is and what the potential is by the questions I asked. I take your point like I see what you're saying.
00:50:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I see what you're saying with the foot and the door. I still think that you may be reframing it in terms of what kind of volume are you looking for? Because that answers your full-time part-time and maybe they don't know it, which in and of itself is a signal because even if it's a good cause, you only have so much energy and time bandwidth. So if it's a poorly managed business or if the arrangement is not leveraged, even if it's a good cause, you might be signing up for or more than you really want to give and can give at this time so that's just something to think about not so and this goes back to you and it's been a while i don't know actually if you and i have ever talked about it but good better best i'm familiar with the concepts so the thing is you have finite yeses if you say yes to good things that's good if you say yes to great things that's great but here's the deal if you fill up with good and great you don't or good better best good and better you don't have room for best so you know do you want the best and and here's the other thing is sometimes we get these things that put something on our radar that never was on our radar before and sometimes that's all we needed so maybe it's all right this isn't really what I've got the bandwidth for right now but now I know I want to put my skills towards helping the Republicans win or or you know what I'm just going to volunteer this or I will do this which isn't everything you want but here's what I'll do here's the price that I'll charge you and here's why I think it's a no-brainer and you could take it or leave it but still put it inside of your terms don't worry about foot in the door because either they're going to vibe with your energy and the mission and the fact that you're not taking advantage of them but that you're also compartmentalizing and going okay but this is this is what I can this is the limit to what I can bring today um but then just and the other the other part of the pitch is but once I get inside and see what you're doing what I'll offer for free is a consultation for optimization and and just what I
00:53:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
see about improvement.
00:53:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you can find where in the conversation to have that or not have that. But remember that even in these things, when you want to get in your foot in the door, remember your level of expertise, that's all. And that there's finite time and energy.
00:53:22 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, for sure. Yeah, I see that.
00:53:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But then go chase the right thing that serves that purpose if you want it because it is an election year. And you do have major skills. So anyway, okay. You still have time.
00:53:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay.
00:53:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would really love to know about the boot camp, how that went.
00:53:47 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know, this is over the boot camp. This the only second time we've done it. I don't love it. Yeah. And it went only at 30. people sign up. so I was emailing with Brian yesterday because he was like, on the next boot camp, I want to add more of his ads to the slides and things like that because they're just basic slides. our response to him was like, yeah, we can do that. But I think the bigger challenge is like figuring out how to sell this. So because we had 60 people sign up on the first one. And, you know, like, if I, if I'm not the target market for the real, real boot camp, like if I had bought that and gone through it, I wouldn't be happy because it's, I mean, it's really kind of about principles. like Brian, Brian's thing is not teaching the, the nitty-gritty pretty stuff. Like he's big picture and he talks in terms of like, you know, like the closest to like a tactical thing he talks about is like when you're developing your first order, always have the second order in mind. And that's a helpful like concept that he can riff on. But that's like an example of like the most tactical that he gets. His wheelhouse is just not in really getting into things that you walk away and you're like, oh man, that's amazing. But at the same time, the reason I say I'm not the target market is because there are people in the boot camp who will say, wow, that was amazing. And they loved it.
00:55:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so, I mean, that's like listening to Socrates or Marcus Aurelius you know there's philosophy and some people's brains don't think like that and they haven't had those teachers so that value is huge because the tactics mean nothing if you don't understand the philosophy behind it and I'm with you I want tactics I'm full of philosophy you know but so segmentation first of all of the list and just kind of being able to figure out who is philosophical and who's tactile tactical and being able to serve them more because whoever's you know soaking up the philosophy more that serves a purpose and you can correlate a monetary benefit to that because it changes how you operate because it You know, like you said, principles, um, so, but, but if there's a person who's looking for tactics, that's going to be so annoying and frustrating because there's nothing super actionable or clearly defined. so, um, something to think about is, is there a way and it could be really short and you could use AI for this. So, have AI just go through all the transcripts and say pull out all the principles. Okay. um, do you have suggestions for tactics, for executing these principles inside of a business? Give an example for this type of business, this type of business, this size of business, this financial, you know, monetary thing type of business, and use it to put maybe a little bit more on it. So, um, And then maybe you can just sell that with what was there plus the outline and maybe some supplemental videos that you do as a not a live thing, but a prerecorded course. See what kind of feedback you get on it, maybe drive traffic just to that and not make it super expensive. But now you've captured all of your existing stuff, your repurposing and not doing good. This is what wasn't. Get some reviews on it. then if you only do a live one once or twice a year, then it gets more energy. You kind of bottleneck it so people have to build up and like look forward to it. And it's kind of a launch style instead, which I think would energize Brian. And you know, that's the whole kind of thing, which also reduces how many times you even have to think about doing it. It just starts like that.
00:59:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, the AI thing is a good idea to be able to see what opportunity might be there to make it a little more tactical because that also helps with selling it and being able to talk about what they're going to get. I was about this today during my workout, it's like for Titans, I'm both the visionary and the integrator and I see, like with Tim, like if I were to propose an idea to Tim, it's like hey, I'm going to do this bootcamp and it's going to, because Tim's got a book coming out, right? So, hey, we're going to do this bootcamp around your book. like, Tim would, would put the thing, an outline of the whole thing together. And, and we would get on a call and we would go through that and we would refine it. And Brian is not going to do that. So if anything is going to happen, it's going to be needed to create it. And so in my mind, I think like, well, break through advertising is one thing, because it's, it's an investment, like it's a brand that's going to outlive Brian. And I've created, so I'm motivated to like, to create around that brand.
01:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's tactical by design.
01:00:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
And it's tactical. Yeah. to liver. You know, that's, that's going to be a, that's not our brand beyond Brian and, and he's, it's, I just always felt like I'm pulling Brian. to, you know, whatever you want to call success after his career in boardroom. And he would tell you that too. So, there's a little bit of a, I feel like I want to protect my time with the over-delivered boot camp of like, in and knock this thing out of the park.
01:01:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you get any conversions yet?
01:01:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, yeah. We've added four people into TXL from the 38. The deadline is Sunday. I think we'll probably end up with 15. So, like, that right there is, that's my motivation is like, okay, if this is a good way to get people into TXL.
01:01:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, let's put a number on that. Yeah. you. Let's say you got. 15 people in.
01:02:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
What does that work to you? Uh, 15 people, you know, tell you. Uh, people.
01:02:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Calculate it right in front of you if you want it.
01:02:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
What's that?
01:02:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
there's a calculator right in front of you if you want it on that computer.
01:02:19 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I'm doing it right now.
01:02:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got my calculator up. My brain would go, uh, I can't do math on the band when somebody's looking at me.
01:02:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So that, if we get 15, that's, uh, 5,400 to me.
01:02:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now roughly how much time do you think it spends on it?
01:02:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Uh, the, the, uh, there were six calls, hour and a half.
01:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Include promotions and anything else.
01:02:56 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, this time I just, I just ran the same email. We did on the first one.
01:03:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:03:02 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I didn't rewrite those. I mean, I want to have calls six of them, so six times. So nine, nine hours for the calls and probably another five hours.
01:03:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Want to know that hourly rate roughly? Three hundred and eighty five dollars an hour.
01:03:31 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
01:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, for everything else that I know that you do, I don't think that you average a lot higher than that. Even with your consulting.
01:03:42 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right.
01:03:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So now the other thing is how much you enjoy the time and how tedious it is and that type of thing. Now that's a big factor. And if you can do things that you enjoy more for roughly the equivalent, you know. amount of time so but that's another reason too and and because you know Ryan has help issues that come up that sometimes things have to get rescheduled he's definitely got a lot of things that that can that come up every year there's something he just had another surgery on his heart oh last month lesson so anyway so taking that and figuring out what you can do to optimize it and then making it an evergreen just pre-recording thing and then if you want to having maybe it's once a year over delivered bootcamp and you pre-sell you know and it's like embedded into everything else like at the bottom of the email p s p s that type of thing offering everything hey we're doing this later and then closer to it do a ramp up advertising thing and now that changes everything the energy should be really hot You can have the tactics, can have all the pretty graphics that make Brian excited about it and really make it a big production, which helps with the brand, which I think matters to Brian. And it's over delivering like it's built to over deliver. He can have other gifts like because you guys can kind of, if you're pre selling it and people are buying it. And you can tell him like if you can't make it live, here's the recordings and you get all of these bonuses. Plus here's the best action bonuses if you sign up between this month and this month because we're going to build up for a whole year, that kind of thing. You can really make it a production that helps him feel like he's keeping his brand live and he's feeding his brand. This isn't Jean's stuff, this is his. And so it's kind of an homage. It mitigizes how much work you put into it. You get to build the engine which you love to do, right? engine is the thing. The demo comes duplicatable. for be a bootcamp if you wanted to do it so you can have be a live versus not but since we know that that really is where most of accelerator members come from and they got to play with that a little bit but anyway you are primed to optimize all of this for multiple reasons brian's health yeah um you're you're just simply doing this everywhere and you've got other options so you don't have to be you know he he doesn't have you over a barrel so to speak you know um there's there's so much that's evolved and on top of that AI can really help take existing content that you've gotten over and over again and go what are the best parts of this and really give you some some tools so that even if you're doing it yourself you're not really you know what i mean i get chatgbt4o changed everything
01:07:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know, actually, I think what I would do, because I'm pretty sure, can't you, you can upload videos into chat GPT. I haven't done it yet.
01:07:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've taken video transcripts, but I wouldn't be surprised if you can now.
01:07:15 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you can't, if not, can get a transcript of it, but I think I would take the recordings from this bootcamp and say, listen to this lesson. And, and they help me come up with, you know, specific tactics that, that would go along with it. That I think would be, because when I think about over-delivered, because I've read the book and it's like, like, it, it just, it's, it requires, for me, just a lot of mental energy, like, to make the connection from the philosophical to, like, how do we make this real?
01:07:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you know what else you could do? Is you could build a couple of avatars Say so chat tpt first of all here's all kinds of my Kent called content. Here's my call recordings Here are things that I've written okay learn me First of all profile me. What do you know about me? Okay? me tell you some other things about how I feel about business what annoys me what I like when I'm looking for help This is what I'm looking for here We're gonna build an avatar around me and people like me so that if I'm serving people like me I know how to talk to them and then we're gonna profile Brian's type of person that likes a philosophy. So profile both of them okay, so then you give them the Him it the the over-delivered PDF okay Tell it what you love about it What was good? But tell them what's tedious for you why it's tedious how it's tedious if you could fix it how you would fix it and give an Example like this is written blah blah blah blah blah blah blah all I wanted to say is
01:09:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
this.
01:09:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want a tactical executable thing. For example, this. Okay, now I want you to go through the whole rest of the book. And I want you to pull out five specific tactics that you think are the most leverageable for any business owner. Okay, first, tell me what they are. Let me approve them. Okay, I approve these. Now, I want you to give me the simplest while also being understandable, comprehensible suggestion for tactical implementation in a business. And I want you to give me three examples and turn them into anecdotes starting with one of those tactics. You could probably improve it, but most of that will be actionable all by itself. You can make the over-deliver, you know, basically what, um, BAM is, you know, for BA, something like that, but it it's for you, but guaranteed other people want that. So the pitch to Brian is like, look, not everybody thinks the same way, but the value is still there. Their brains just operate differently. Let's give them this. And so yeah, take all the videos, take the PDF, and then direct it on a mental process, you know, type of vibe avatar.
01:10:34 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
01:10:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think about even exciting too, and take the tediousness out of it, because it's happening so fast, and you get to watch happen and you get to watch it go, I didn't do that. I just directed it, and you whip it all out there. So that could put some energy back into you around something that I felt like it's been draining.
01:10:58 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I mean, the nice thing about the bootcamp is like, I don't have to teach it, and you know, it's like it's a low-ask of me in terms of delivery. I also think that part of, and I share this with Brian's, do think a contributing factor to the number of signups is that we held it in July, because the last time we held it in April. And so I suggested to him, it's like, I think that we should just plan out a bootcamp cadence for the year. So Q1, we do a BA bootcamp, Q2, we do an over-delivered bootcamp, then Q4, we do another BA bootcamp. And we just have those on the calendar.
01:11:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or end of Q3, like, so end of September, where people have been in school, all the college kids are in school, everybody's in school now, and they've had a little time to, you know, because you've got an end. In the country, a huge amount of people start school in August and then September and then the colleges. by the end of September, 1st week of October, you're not in holiday mode and everybody has settled down and starting to fall into their fall routine and I don't think people take enough advantage of that particular time of the year of availability mentally and energetically financially, we recovered the, you know, working during the summer, spending all the expenses there, kind of thing.
01:12:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So anyway, something to take into account. That's true. All right.
01:12:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

I'm sleepy, I got up at 5.30, but I'm good.
00:00:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It breaks your throat behind me, I was gonna think, oh yeah, that's funny because you know what honestly I'm just waking up like I woke up early but I feel kind of groggy too but I know I'm getting better and I wrote out instead of reading the Bible this morning I actually just wrote out one of my favorite ones is I can she I just wrote it right but what I'm loving I have this for like seven years I've barely used it I use it for videos for posting videos online and stuff but I have this big it's not it's not your your smaller size I've got I'm just gonna bring it just so you can see the size of it.
00:00:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like yeah, so I'm using Notability and I'm he's not even bigger than mine I've got the iPad Pro and I thought I had the bigger one but maybe they go there.
00:00:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is like the 12.9 inch on a second. Okay, maybe it's my head small.
00:01:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know. No, I mean, I'm Hold on. No, yours looks way bigger.
00:01:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And a little for comparison.
00:01:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This was a pretty big Bible. That's yeah, I mean, this is this is mine with the magic case and stuff. I didn't know they go.
00:01:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They've got that big double point. No, let's see. This is my iPhone.
00:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's 15. See, Jesus, maybe yours is the same size. It's just kind of the optical illusion of me.
00:01:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
When we show you this alert, this is my this is my lock screen.
00:01:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, cool. I love him.
00:01:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know.
00:01:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are you doing on your big old iPad?
00:01:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, yeah, so I have this app called Notability.
00:01:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You ever heard it?
00:01:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm not sure I have actually. Okay. So it's just an app where, like besides just knows the stuff, he didn't get right on it. But what I've been journaling on it, right? So you saw the picture of it from my yesterday, so that's what I was using, you know, I was writing on it. So, and I just grabbed like a template, so it was right, and then what I do is I used to do marketing videos on it, that's kind of what I have it, like yesterday's thing, like I make it in Canva, but then, you know, I put it here, see, and then when I come up, then I might have a graph, but then I can, you know, talk to it, right? Yeah. so here, then I kind of, you know, draw it. So it kind of keeps people's attention, right, when you're drawing on it. And ages ago, I used to use it, I have a stand for it, so I used to put it up here and then just record my videos, and then upload it to Facebook or Facebook ads, whatever. So, of course, video ads made easy, and I was trying to people how to record the iPad or their phone. It's I like drawing. I guess that's why I got the bigger screen probably QA is that way you got the bigger?
00:03:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and that and my older lady eyes. Yeah Yeah, this stage where I wear glasses all the time except for when I'm working on a screen cuz I have to go like this. Yeah, I had coke bottles losses from age seven till 20 Six maybe and I got LASIK But now they're they're starting to disintegrate again and So what happens now do you have to get LASIK together? What do they say to freedom? I would probably really just have to deal with it because what happens when we get older is the muscles start to weaken and So the distance from near and far becomes more difficult But I'm like there's got to be an exercise and everybody's like nope There's no exercise and then I finally saw a video And someone's like, yeah, you just go focus out here, focus in here, focus out there, and keep doing it.
00:04:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
like, that makes sense. So I need to try that. I don't have good eye genes. I'm a little bit the same. look at Lasik, but I've been wearing context, gosh, since I was like 13. And for every step, I don't have to get it. And then now, you know, not only my 50s, I'm like, maybe I'll just wait. But yeah, this is interesting.
00:04:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If there's a surgery I can get, I will do it. I mean, Lasik was really painful, but it's still tolerable. it in the hours later, I had perfect vision, which was amazing because the peripheral, like I get a little vertigo and just oriented with the rims of my glasses. And then my hair and like, there's all this stuff. So I don't have my full peripheral access because of that. And yeah, I think if there's a surgery and also technology keeps evolving so quickly and we will. But because I have a stigmatism, I can't really where contacts, a stigmatism and the bifocal view issues, so it has to be some significant improvement in technology to really help me a lot, or basically get a new cornea.
00:05:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. So that's a high level surgery, and I'm not sure I'm going to go there, and that's not going to go there. don't You're right with technology. Who knows? Five years from now, yeah.
00:05:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So you are, you got a process to try to work on finding your compass, yeah. So sorry, I got a hair in my mouth. Um, we get to talk longer, tomorrow I'd love to just kind of like, hammer you with some questions and go deep, whatever, but for today what I would love to know is, do you feel like, um, you have enough to just keep you focused on
00:06:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
getting more clarity and I like to break things down by the week like if you have an idea like I know what I want to do today I know why I want to do it today my day is full if I get done at the end of the day and these things are done I will have felt like I was on track even if I don't know the big picture I have steps for my now yeah I feel I feel that like I feel more calm or comfortable that I think it's just more about also just taking the action as well to kind of just figure out what what the final kind of compass is right now so so direct answer your question yeah yes I have on my schedule like what I know I need to done today actually want to get your opinion on the power graphic I've started on your your stuff so it's a balance between my own stuff and then also client-like, but I'm really excited about the whole YouTube channel and helping women over in their 40s and 50s kind of reinvent themselves how to start making money online. It's very basic, but I think that's needed and I vacillate between working with beginners versus people for CEOs and already doing really well because I can do both, but I think by doing especially if we've probably come across this a lot for you, a lot of people are scared of getting laid off their executive job, and then how do they do consulting or coaching or do they do a digital offer? That's what I'm sort of playing with and I've got already laid out out of 10 YouTube videos that I want to do, so it's more just starting it and yeah, just kind of going with that. I did have another person reach out to me since yesterday's video. So I said, hey, I once bought left for I kind of thought I could use one more consulting client. So I'm going to probably just quote on something not like huge amount of per month because I don't want. I don't want the responsibility. I love creating. You asked me what brings you joy. I love creating. love low ticket funnels. And I thought, oh my god, I like, yeah, start focusing on that and help me with that. But also maybe make some in advance and flip it, right? Hey, I got a converting offer here. Try some ads for it. already converting. If you have a good back end that this works perfectly for your offer, know, buy this for me for life 15 or 25k, right? So it's done because a lot of people pay 20k to get something done, like, and they don't know if it's going to work, you know? or they're announced as paralysis because I don't to, know, to case really low compared to what, you know, but. uh he's like changed his topic for me three times the last you know 30 days so that's why I haven't started on his because like right when my meet and then we're gonna go with this literally few days later oh no I decided to change my offer I'm gonna do this so best how about we do front in here so I didn't even respond to him he's in front of my dude I didn't even respond to his last text when he said oh I'd rather do this of like I'm gonna come full service and no we decided on this you need to stick with it because you're going or you can pay a new price because I've already started this so if that's that important to you we're renegotiating that's a new contract that's a new price yeah your indecision is not my obligation is not my responsibility is is not anything we had an agreement you renegotiating opens my renegotiating so either we're done and I'm paid by or if you want help the price that you pay for your uncertainty is your
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
delay, but also my fee, because your uncertainty is not my burden.
00:10:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I like that. That's good. Yeah. Oh, and then other things besides business, like, because I know a lot of it's about self-love, self-care, my nails done here straight. So, oh, you're both red. Yeah, I noticed that. And next week, I'm going to go get my hair highlighted, because I just, you know, everyone will feel good when we're doing that.
00:10:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:10:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I just have to figure out some of my office space since, like, I sprained my knee, and it's kind of hard to go up and down stairs when my office was. So, I'm right here, my living room, and I did bring my soft box lighting down to record part of the video yesterday. So, I'm kind of getting settled in on that. So, I think I'm making movements on that too.
00:10:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah. Yeah, it's the environment makes a big deal. When I go into the bathroom and I see myself and my hair looks dull and my energy. my color looks dull. I don't really wear jewelry because I can't.
00:11:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would. I love sparkly.
00:11:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love sparkly beauty. The beauty of the earth, the beauty anywhere, energizes me. I think it does that to everybody. look at beauty and you just, whether it's the ocean or the sunset or whatever, beauty is powerful. Sometimes people use it really superficially, but I think that there's something to be said for like even in Adam and Eve, we're in the garden of Eden and it was perfect and God said, go dress this garden.
00:11:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, you made it perfect.
00:11:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You want me to go do something to improve it? Like, improvements upon what we have is part of the plan to always, you know, all of these things. so if we are continually improving our environment, I'm adding more light, light. or color, for me, lights a big deal.
00:12:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't have enough windows, I'm depressed.
00:12:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If everything is really dark, I'm depressed. Yeah, so it's a big deal. So you going and doing that, creating the content, just pondering on your compass. For me, I call it an anchor because my compass is more a moral compass, it's my values.
00:12:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And that can't be somebody else or something else.
00:12:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is my own personal values, but my anchor that everything is attached to is God. It's that I have a Father and a Heavenly Mother. And I want to be like my Heavenly Mother and I want to be like them. And I love them and I want to honor them and I don't want to hurt their children, even if their children are really mean and horrible to me, I have to remember that hurting them is hurting him. And so I have, you know what I mean? Like I just thinking about those things. um actually creates my values and my compass comes from that but I don't I personally just don't think of it as my compass I think of it as my my center um maybe like the pole which my compass operates like it's my north pole kind of thing yeah yeah so but additionally you're you agreed to show up to talk to me every day so yeah for me I did this with you I got two other women that I will speak with weekly nobody else daily yeah but but I put that into my life um the exercising my mission and just all these little things and I draw a little bit of energy from it but the social part of it though especially the women yeah because we tend to encourage each other and also we catch each other if we're playing small yeah or you know if we're dealing with somebody who's a using us. And then, you know, that word gets thrown around very loosely, but tab using just means using poorly. It doesn't mean that you're baiting us. It doesn't mean that you're a terrible horrible man. But to pay for your time and to make an agreement and then to add more work on it because somebody changed their mind is abusing. It's not using you as a grade-upon outside of, you know. So I built things like that into my life so that I don't keep having it. You're building that. One way or another, things are going to just improve because of the compounding effect of the environment that you're creating and the energy that you're improving. So it's awesome. love how simple it is. And again, that's like a fundamental principle, right? It's just improve your environment. It's what you're having showing up in your life consistently and things just get better.
00:14:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh yeah, yeah, exactly. yeah, so like I yeah, so Oh, feeling good. You know, I know, um, as part of, uh, sort of into searching around my mom as well. And, uh, There's a little bit of codependency between us, right? You know, so, so even though I love spending time for, I can't spend every single minute of like a lunch or dinner with her because then I'm the crutch to her and she needs to start socializing on her own. So I kind of had that realization, like even like she's funny, called this morning. My brother was there on, can you stop by? was way to work. And so he picked up and said, I'm glad you're there. And they said, yeah, I brought my Macapuccino. So cool. And then, and then, and then, and then when I talk to my mom, So will I see you today? And I'm like, well, no pause there. And then you also have, we have one girl a week that comes and takes her shopping to her favorite grocery store and all this stuff, like the three hours spent time with her. And, uh, I said, no, you're seeing Lisa today. And will I see you tomorrow? Like she wants every day. And I said, well, we'll see, mom. But, um, you know, so, so that was a big, I mean, sort of realized that a while ago, too, because I know my sister even said she lives in five hour flight, but she said, you two really could pet her on each other, like she's come to, like, like literally, if I don't call her for a couple days, when I was sick about a while ago, I love five voicemails from her. But yeah, where are you? But yeah, when you come by, or if we could bring some orange juice to you, like, so it's adorable. But at the same time, I know that she's got a fly on her wings, too, and not just depend on me. So, because she's got a lot of friends, does art tomorrow afternoon for art friends. Like, got a lot of activities. I just don't want her, um, I guess what I'm saying is it was just a good realization and me encouraging her, because when she called me, why don't you call so-and-so your friend? Why don't you call, you know, this person, like, so I'm, you know, it's just, it's just a place that I'm co-hosting her, you know, it's that ever, it's that question of what's, what does she want? I still feel she'll be better socializing in a retirement home, but I also have to let go of the wheel and let her decide that, you know, that's the thing, yeah.
00:17:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Really tough. The one thing, especially working on my psychology classes is studying the difference between individualistic cultures and collectivist cultures, like Japan, China, Eastern cultures, African cultures, they're collectivist. They are more about the collective group and the community rather than the individual. The individual isn't lost though. It's just that we all are part of each other and we have, you know, Latinas are multi-generational houses and nobody calls that codependent because it's called family. And the thing about this individualistic culture I feel like there's a lot of the adversary of Satan, darkness that tries to pull families apart and cause it pop culture and psychology and says dependency. And so I would say trust your heart and your feelings. I do think we all need to work on our socializing. I think that our happiness is attached to a single other person, whether it's a spouse or a child or a friend or whatever. I think that's too much burden. I think that we're supposed to have bigger communities. But I do think that it is really a dark and poor thing that we have called it individualistic and independent and separated ourselves from each other. The happiest and the most, the longest living cultures have three or four generations in their house. They don't lock their doors, their windows are always open, nobody calls that codependency, they live the longest. I don't think it's Italy, but it's in that area. Yeah, so I would say that you have a very strong heart, and I think that that is what your compass is, your love and your heart. I think your love is. I think the reason you thought it was your dad was because you loved him so much, because he had so much of your heart. But really, I think it's your heart. I think your heart tells you what is true, I think that when we feel lost, we look for guidance, and I think we have to be very careful to not just who we look at, but what is the why behind it. solid are they in their compass? how happy are they? How happy have their decisions made them? Do they have a lot of love in their lives? Do they have really loving relationships? Are they complaining about other relationships a lot?
00:20:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do they feel bitter and angry?
00:20:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you're going to take advice, take it from advice from people who are happy, who are centered, who are peaceful. Yeah. But yeah, so it's a hard thing. for sure need to be able to have our own identity that just is us. But part of us is part of other people. Your mom still has your cells in her body. She is attached to you. It's tethered. It's not, she's not a friend. She's not, um, yeah. Anyway, just, just something I've considered, you know, my mom was really, really abusive to me. We aren't close, but I a thing about her every day, I want to get to the point where I can buy her as she wants a traveling van or an RV and just to be free and go wherever she wants to go. She'll never be able to do that for herself. And so my goal is that in five years, I can make that happen for her.
00:21:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:21:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Along with the ability to help her sustain that and but I'll only do it if she will agree to join groups where she can travel into other people. Because we don't have a kind of relationship where we can live together. Although I would and I don't plan on having a set house, plan being portable, mobile and going out anywhere. Otherwise I would make a place for her that was close to me even though we don't get along well because I think that that's how important it is. And God told us honor your mother and father that they days may be long upon the earth. And here's the thing that people never quote this by the way, but they also say parents provoke not nice children. and unto wrath lest he esteem thee as thine enemy. Always talk about honor your parents, but they don't talk about the parents role, too, honor their children. Anyway, some sort of thought as you're going through this, think adding the friends and the community is great, but if you just love being with your mom and it brings you, she's not gonna be here forever.
00:22:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, I know, yeah, yeah. So I'm not gonna live in my house here, but with the dog and the cat, the dog's 85 pounds, and I'm scared. Yeah, knock your mom over. Yeah, yeah, it's little dangerous for her. Yeah. And she does like her own place. She likes her own solace. And then she's an artist, too, so she likes, yeah, that's why she was no, like, she even freaked out us hiring Lisa to spend three hours of her every Tuesday, who's a retired nurse and perfect for her, right?
00:22:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My mom's a retired nurse, you know? Strong woman, huh?
00:22:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So yeah, no, thank you for that. That's that's that's And also, because yeah, Lithuanian is the sense is my mom and dad were born Lithuania, even though they met in Canada when they were, you know, in their 20s. But like our East European heritage, like typically, yeah, the parents live with the kids, you know, like, like my dad's sister had my dad's, actually they live side by side, they had two little houses side by side, you know. And so, but no, my mom's funny.
00:23:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's like, no, I love that. I'm really excited about tomorrow, because I want to ask lots of questions, but I'm also really excited.
00:23:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
would love to see the power wrap right that you started. Yeah, I mean, it's, it's, it's not like, what do you call a, it's important just to be very simple about it, but I like it like the start of it. That's, that's kind of it. Oh, did I send you what Maui made? You sent me the Canva presentations.
00:24:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. I get to send this to you because I have a graphic sky. You're going to be annoyed that I've worked with for like 10 years. He's from the Philippines and I was like, I told him I was going to have it and want it. But I wasn't ready for it yet. But he's like, here, man, I already got to start it. I was like, Maui, I didn't even give you instructions yet.
00:24:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But this is what he made.
00:24:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I sent you on Facebook because I don't know how to download it from here. Oh, you sent me on Facebook? Hold on. Hold on. I will screen share with you. You're going to laugh. I think you're going to laugh. Watch this.
00:24:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's good too.
00:24:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's beautiful.
00:24:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I like it. Yeah.
00:24:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Why is there an iced tea? either. No, he is a goofball. I don't know.
00:25:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And he's generous. She got a dick in it. It could be coffee too. But yeah, he's really good.
00:25:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
By the way, you're graphic. he's he's wonderful. Um, he's got three daughters and a wife there in the Philippines. And he's respectful, so kind, works quickly. Very humble. Yeah, I love, I love the Filipino people.
00:25:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They're very good people. Well, I love it.
00:25:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, God. So any updated this spreadsheet for me too? Is this the right one? No, that's not the right one. Let's see if I can get animation of open client stuff.
00:25:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:25:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I was like, Maui, can you go take, you know, put it in a spreadsheet? So like, I want to improve how this looks a little bit better. So I was working on that. The other thing, is this the right thing? Did you happen to take a look at this?
00:26:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, I know you told me about it this morning, but I haven't had a chance yet, but I will this afternoon.
00:26:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Um, I wondered if it might be helpful.
00:26:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It would take a whole, probably five minutes. I don't want to, but if I just read it to you.
00:26:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. how it flows because the difference of the text versus like my voice is the difference, right?
00:26:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, yeah. Yeah.
00:26:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. I'm gonna get my water.
00:26:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I got.
00:26:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Um, probably needs to work on this, but anyway. All right. Hey there, genius. I know you're a genius because you just chose a path of working so much smarter. You don't know me yet, but you're going to learn very quickly that I am hyper excited about what I do. Part of that might just be the H and the ADHD, but I don't it. And what I can tell you is that if you're a person who's also struggled to focus, you are going to love what I teach you if you're willing to suspend your irritation.
00:27:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
about doing organizational tasks, everything I have ever done since high school has been around getting the greatest results from the least amount of effort.
00:27:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not because I'm lazy but because I despise waste and I have finite energy and only 24 hours a day and only a handful of those really spent on what matters to me. I want an amazing life and I figured out how to create that for myself. Along the way I figured out how to help people who have totally different values and mental processes do the same. The exercise you're about to go through has been life-changing for so many. It is deceptively simple. It looks like an ordinary spreadsheet but and I need you to really hear me on this. Pretend that the spreadsheet is like Clark Kent. It only looks like a nerdy news reporter but in real life it's a superhero. I first had people go through this exercise 12 years ago under another program called My Freedom Systems. I have been delighted to learn that this exercise alone own was deemed worth the price of my full course at that time. And not only that, but 12 years later, these principles are still just as useful and valuable in helping people make the most amount of money with the least amount of time and stress. I'll give you two other examples of how this exercise impacted two very different people. One, a voice coach and a musician who hated numbers and all things administrative. By the way, I have yet to meet a business owner who liked the advent and stuff, but she trusted me and so she did the exercise. When she finally finished the work, she immediately saw how she could reach her goals exponentially faster. I'll link her testimony below if you want to hear from her. She wanted to buy a ranch to foster children and teach music and she got there three years early. In fact, I just got the sweetest message from her on my birthday, a video of her on a ranch inviting me to come visit. When I tell you I'm different, but I can get two results.
00:28:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I hope that you will trust me just enough to try this for yourself.
00:29:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll also tell you got a doctor client in mind who just this week just did this exercise and how it flipped what he thought he knew about his business. He has multiple businesses with varying degrees of effort and profit margins. He was 1000% positive that one particular channel was the most profitable turns out. Another part of his business actually makes him $1,666 more per hour than the one that made him the most amount of money. So by switching five hours a week from one business to the other, he will make over 86. No, I'm actually did that math. It was like 430,000 more per year.
00:29:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
told you my math.
00:29:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, 430 half a million dollars almost more. This is why you're such a genius because you're going to learn in just a few minutes, what wasn't taught in medical school and isn't taught how to be anywhere else, including business schools, but in tiny corners of the world where some someone nerdy like me figured out how to do some awesome math and you stumbled into one of those corners. You may not know how to make. But you may know how to make money, but if you do not know what to do to make the most amount of money in the least amount of time in your own business with your own skill sets, then you might be spending more time in low profit activities and cutting your earning power in half or more. That is what this exercise is going to reveal. I'm not going to teach you how to make money. You should not be here. If you don't already have a business that generates money. What I am going to show you is how to leverage your time according to your skills and your existing business. You will discover ways to improve things according to your own values, skills, and resources.
00:30:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
There is nothing magic here, even if it feels like it is when you're done.
00:30:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What I will help you receive is clarity. That clarity will move you like few things ever have and you will do it with so much confidence. Do the work. Tell me your mom that you can't.
00:30:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Ready to see? Let's go. I love it. Love it.
00:30:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's perfect.
00:30:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yay! I love it I love it um so like when you do that video do you um do you do do captions underneath or are you gonna just let like we can do everything what I'll do is I'll start it first I think you should have captions because the study that I read is that people are watching videos at work or they can't listen and they want to consume the content so you need to make it so that they can consume it on mute wherever they're at whenever they're at perfect I also think maybe popping up some little emojis some little like one or two pictures of what it looks like or little things just the the engagement right so it's not just my face and just the words because we do have that ADHD but also if it's done right they reinforce the message your graphic artist seems so good if you give them the script you might come up with a few things things to keep me.
00:32:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's that's a great idea. I don't have a video editor. But you know, what I should do is talk to him and see what kind of because I don't because I pay him hourly. And if he's got a slow machine and stuff, I'm not I don't I don't want him to do that. But yeah, I would love to be able to give him more consistent work. So I will see if he wants to get into some super simple video editing.
00:32:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, good idea. I'm like using CapCut or VDDIO. We have our guy. He's not as creative or didn't he doesn't listen to my instructions. So we have him back on Pinterest. But we did I did train him on these CapCut and how to do stuff. So he was able to do it for the Philippines. just though he thought he could do a lot more other things besides what I asked him to do to a video.
00:32:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, what are you doing?
00:32:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so yeah, but no, no big deal. But anyways, yeah, that could be cool. But
00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that's perfect like and that's huge about the doctor and meaning like oh my gosh I was like do yeah like this by the way is paid for my coaching for years if you actually implement what I've just taught you a five hour shift each week yeah the problem is that the business model he has has limitations to how much he can do and grow but but he had no idea he was 100% sure it was yeah I feel like it's got to be more than that I've got to do the math hold on a second that's huge no really huge what's tall well congratulations that's a big win so I get up with all the time Maria that's what these things do wait we do what sorry this activity that's what it does this happens all the time that kind of revelation that can result in millions pretty quickly if I'm working with high-level people and for low low where I don't say low level people, but lower earning people. What happens is that clarity confidence, which reduces stress. It reduces their mental friction every day. So even though they're not making as much money fast, I removed a huge burden. This, this is normal, like getting massive cause as normal anyway.
00:34:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, when I like about it, too, is that like even for me, like, even though, yeah, I still figure out the exact offer and, you know, what business I want to have over the next, you know, year, five years, even 10 years out. Um, but what do I do now? Like just doing that activity is like, regardless, like I was doing nothing to build my audience, like it was, it was like crazy and a lot of shiny object syndrome, you know, not going lie, like, oh, yeah, want to research YouTube videos and before I know it, I'm two hours into it. It's like, no, it didn't need. So it was interesting. was really good for me to go, okay, if I want to make money, I better start showing up more, period. like even if I haven't figured it all out yet, just show up more because I know that I used to teach people, hey, more lives you do the more money you make, you know.
00:35:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and you have way to capture the people that show up, like you have an offer to make because showing up doesn't do any good if you don't offer to drive them to follow up sequence to continue to nurture them to ascend them. So, you know, that's a big conversation. But yeah, for sure, I'm glad that that was insightful for you.
00:35:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, how can I just, I know we're supposed to get going because we want to keep this short, how can I help you get this low-tech offer off the ground? Because originally, typically I do the graphics, but you kind of had a guy do it, which is amazing, right? go with that. do you do you drink coffee, right? you drink coffee? Oh, you don't?
00:35:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
then keep it as the iced tea. I don't drink iced tea either.
00:35:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So yeah, but typically, like I kind of put it up on like a could funnel page or something and and the person then imports that into their click funnels, or they if they have goal level, they import there. I'm looking at system I own myself because I got pissed off at active campaign tripling the price of my service. Yeah, they do a lot changes and they change plans and it's like my bill tripled. I like what are you guys doing them? So they're because they added AI in it and they added the sales pipeline management to it, but I don't want those features. So yeah, so anyways, so a lot of people I know are starting to use the system. But yeah, what can I do to help move the little ticket offer forward?
00:36:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I got decided to use Wordpress and Elementor and funnel kit. And this is a landing page that I liked the template of and that's really too much for a this low ticket offer, but it's very easy to pick and choose a few things from here and then got everything else. And with funnel kits, they have really simple, and I didn't know she'd done this, a good job for her. Really simple stuff. mean, this looks like an onter page, really, this is the basic template for an onter page also. So really, I feel like I get the copy in my sales letter. The things that need to happen is ads follow up sequences. I don't know, you know, you've already has your offer and you know what you're do, you do, but any first of all, any just kind of directional support saying, okay, this is what we need to do next. Let's set a date, let's set a time. Giving feedback on the copy is amazing. But, you know, I haven't run ads in, I mean, 12 years.
00:38:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:38:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
still think that I could do amazing at it, but I don't want to. I want to serve my clients. I want to create the content. So whatever I can tap other people's brains for and pay for or exchange, you know, my services for. Or that's what I want to do because, and this is what I teach everybody is the more types of work you do, the more friction you create because of the, yeah, get out of flow of, you know, if it's analytical, if it's creative, if it's administrative, all those different types of things, it takes a while to shift from one to another. And so I want to minimize the shifting and the only way that I can do that will the best way for me to do that, especially with the minimal amount of time that I'm that I want to work. And so that when I do what I do, I do it at the highest level is by using other people for the other things. Now, I'll probably always tweak some copy and be like, oh, let's do this. Let's do that a little bit. So I feel like I'm pretty good at copy and psychology and persuasion. But any help in the creation or suggestions or, hey, you should probably have a seven day follow up sequence for this. And maybe these are the bullet points or these are things. Anything that reduces my mental load by zooming me into the next step a little bit closer, just because I can get there doesn't mean that it doesn't help lift my burden.
00:39:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, have a good like a typically I deliver the load ticket off where there's like a little Google slide presentation and it's like maybe some suggestions templates for the abandoned cart email series. Wait, if you're using this template, is there an Abandoned carts. Do they first click a button and enter the email to get to the order checkout page? Initially, it's not a deal breaker at by any means.
00:40:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, no funnel kit. Let me go Abandoned card to see what Google tells me Captain V. It's boost orders time. follow up some brothers. I don't know They probably your sales page example again.
00:40:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
me see what happens when they click the button to buy it That you're this one. Yeah, when they say get in there what happened? Oh, it takes right there Okay, so there's two choices You could just take them right there and we just test that out And then the next choice can be when they click that button kind of frank hernsel They enter their email not their name or anything else. They're just their email to then get to this page So then there's an automation that we can run that checks after life say 15 minutes Then they buy or not and if they didn't buy then typically a three email Series that's called a band and cart where it's like hey notice you Didn't check out finish your checkout process, you know, did like get in the way and you can include your customer testimonial, come back and buy it. But it's not critical because I just saw today, I was talking about lady that has a $77 frontend offer teaching people how to become fractional consultants. And she uses a Sam cart and she has no band cart and yet she's converting at 5%, which is really good for a $77 offer. So, you know, we could start with this first and then see what the conversion rates are and then go from there.
00:41:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I like that. And also, I've got my dev girl putting in Google Analytics on there to make sure that we can track all of that.
00:41:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, beginning. Another note, like, I think you and I talk about this. Do you, are you going to start a YouTube channel?
00:41:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I know. I mean, I know that I mean, all of my business has been a word of mouth and it's always also and the way people I've had people recommend me who've never even worked with me because of my Facebook posts. So my content is powerful and it wasn't even video. I can't even tell you how many times I've been told you should write a you should do a podcast, you should be on video, whatever. So I know that I need to do that and I know that YouTube is the king for lower cost leads. You tap into the SEO power there as well. So yeah, I would want to create the content for YouTube and repurpose elsewhere rather than the other way around.
00:42:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, and I'm kind of attacking that strategy too. So I just because Facebook's good and ads are good, but it's just it's when you turn ads off for whatever reason that all of a sudden it's nothing, right? get no more traffic. Whereas YouTube, some of my friends that have started their YouTube tube channel even a couple years ago, they're still getting traffic from something from three years ago a video they did, right?
00:43:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, what do we think about this over the other one? With the express checkout option up there versus this? I love when these things are up at the top, especially if there's Apple Pay. Should I do that?
00:43:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah, because they already saw the sales page you clicked to buy, but go back to the top then again.
00:43:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can get rid of most of the stuff.
00:43:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, that's very simplistic and yeah, that's fine. Let's see what that's there. It reminded me a little But what Shopify looks like, and that's kind of why I was thinking maybe subconsciously, that's a good thing. Yeah, anything that is familiar. Yeah, like the top part necessarily, but that part there. Right. Shopify sometimes, you know.
00:44:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but just replace this with like a purple strip. What is Shopify as a blue or purple? I don't remember.
00:44:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
think it's purple. Uh, well, it depends on if someone changed the cart, because the standard one, I think, is just white with your logo will be on the top left, right?
00:44:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I think this will probably be better. Sorry, and that's the thing, I think, too, that will be great about our short calls is that, so when we get clarity on what are the steps, be like, okay, what did you do? And then like, okay, well these are the things I have to do, but I'm not sure if I should do this or this or This or this? Yeah, I think that is going to become a very big part of the conversation, probably for both of us. I was thinking this, I was thinking this, here's my criteria, got anything to add to it to help me kind of like narrow it down. And then obviously we make our own decisions, but that feedback with somebody who understands all the nuance of the decision is super helpful. And then, okay, cool, then I'm not gonna sit with that all day going should I do that?
00:45:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Should I do that?
00:45:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that little echo is just enough. And even if it's wrong, it doesn't even matter if it's wrong. Sometimes just hearing something back gets us to take action. We learn if it's right or wrong through testing.
00:45:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:45:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're never going to guess everything correctly. Our opinions don't really mean anything. But we use them before we activate ourselves into action. Yeah. so anyway, but I think that I'll get inhabited being much faster with that kind of stuff and like.
00:46:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anyways, anyway, cool. Love it. Okay. Wow. Let's go Have an amazing day. All right. See you.

Hi, Tina.
00:00:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi, how are you?
00:00:08 - Laura L
Oh, good yourself.
00:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. of tired out from the gym, but it's good for me. okay. So I have made some decisions. Um, I do want to use my existing domain. Profit drivers, or profit drivers.
00:00:27 - Laura L
Yeah, profit drivers, right? Yeah.
00:00:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Remember everything. Okay. Um, and then, okay. So last year, I decided that I really wanted to use Buddy Boss, but I was having a hard time with it. So there's two things to that. It is, well, first of all, are you familiar with Buddy Boss at all?
00:00:48 - Laura L
And I haven't heard of it. Is it a final, I mean, bench builder?
00:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Kind of. Have you heard of Buddy Press?
00:00:59 - Laura L
I can. didn't. I mean, I didn't hear about that.
00:01:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so the Buddy Press has been a WordPress thing for a long time, and it has, it kind of is Facebook-esque. Like it has a social platform to it. You can send friend requests. It's a forum, but it was created to be more social. I don't know how old you are, when I started, well, first of all, when I started, we had dial-up internet, but we used forums and chat rooms a lot, and then Facebook came along. So this before Facebook came, we had all these forums, which I'm sure you've seen forums, they're still used, but this kind of combines all of that. So anyway, they have a WordPress theme, and then they also have a native app. So I wanted to be able to offer a native app to people. Oh, yeah. Okay, so here's a thing. Hold on. me see. Magic link. I forgot that that's what we were looking on. Buddy box magic. I don't know if they have that Magic login. The magic login link. So I don't think it has that. Okay, so that kind of changes it. I was so sorry. I was thinking about a few different things and I remember that we were going to do high level because high level could do that. But then my friend was like, are you going to want to resell it? And if so, then you should Probably get your own accounts.
00:02:49 - Laura L
So Yeah, I think I did a test with a page speed score or mobile. They don't have that impressive score. But for desktop, it is good, but most people are into mobile nowadays.
00:03:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And then there was another thing that a friend of mine told me about called system.io. It's system with an E at the end of it. .io. Let me see if they have magically log into my and all caps. Let's see. Magic thing. I want the benefits of Web3 with highly scalable, battle-tested secure. no, that's not it. Set up your magic link with system.io. Okay. Um, well, I'm sorry, but this, this, I'm very happy to pay you
00:04:00 - Laura L
You just sit here while we figure things out.
00:04:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll show my screen. So we're looking at it together.
00:04:06 - Laura L
I also have a like a spreadsheet of the other platforms that has magic link, like. Oh, you do. Yeah, the test that you delegated me last. Yes. I did a spreadsheet. And the one that has that magic link is teachable.
00:04:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's not OK.
00:04:28 - Laura L
So expensive.
00:04:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It isn't or it is.
00:04:32 - Laura L
It is not. The basic plan is $39 per month. Oh, nice. Yeah. And there's another one thing, Kiffik.
00:04:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, yeah. And I have clients that love Kiffik. And did you have any thoughts about either one of them, any anything that you found? Like you think that this would be good, bad, above your feedback.
00:04:58 - Laura L
Yeah. For most people, like I search, I mean, one of the blogs, I mean, three blogs, actually, they prefer beachable or thinkific. Let me send you the link here to this spreadsheet, because I included the cons, the pros and the beach juice.
00:05:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Again, Trello, huh? Yeah. Okay, I'm already here. Sorry. We'll definitely start to get more organized once we're out of summer and school starting, but wait, let's see. The recent maybe at OR and there go.
00:05:50 - Laura L
And then the card is in progress. Okay, that's not this one. Yeah, correct. Okay. And then you can see There are the below that. Yeah, the Google Drive link, that's it.
00:06:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, you are so sorry about this. Okay, easy to use, strong course creation tools, good student engagement features, that's great. Highly customizable limited marking tools. I don't care about that so much, sign customization, track reduction fees, lower 5% transaction fees. Oh, yeah, that's the thing that I forgot about. Like, I don't want to let's see, free plan with transaction fees. Oh, and then if I pay the pro, there's zero transaction fees. Okay, that's probably where I'd end up being anyway. And then this no transaction fees on paid plans. Course in creation. Okay. and let's see, let's just take a look at them. Do they have like, let's see, anything you want to tier, membership tiers. I like the affiliate marketing a five admin seats, the example for website. And community, although I guess that's not. as big a thing, but I do care a little bit about community. Was there anything that stood out to you about having like a forum where members can interact with each other?
00:08:15 - Laura L
That's the one in Nance, I didn't check for the community.
00:08:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I don't know that I emphasized that I was thinking about it, but I don't think that we really made that a thing.
00:08:31 - Laura L
And it's, it isn't the priority, but it is for the community thing. Is it also not like doing a Facebook, a private Facebook group?
00:08:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, but I don't want Facebook to control my business because they can shut down very quickly. So remember live lessons, events, let's see, easy to use, of course quizzes and surveys. love that. at um community. I think if I can then teach people how to and so let's look at this. No person do not refer us community. So let's look at some examples, teachable community example. I can type. I really can. Let's see what this well that's not great. Oh rainbow cursor. What kind of dog do you have?
00:09:49 - Laura L
I just eat cute um mix of a poodle and I'm already afraid but it's a very small dog. We have two.
00:10:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:10:02 - Laura L
Yeah. My kid likes to have dogs. So that's the reason why we got two, but me personally, I'm not the talk lover.
00:10:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, we have two dogs. We have one that's a poodle mixed with a B-Shawn Frigé. What was that?
00:10:21 - Laura L
Very cute.
00:10:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, she is very cute. But she loves a lot poodle, and then we have a havinise.
00:10:28 - Laura L
Is it hypoallergenic?
00:10:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's supposed to be, but he's not. He bothers my allergy and asthma. The most hypoallergenic dogs there are the B-Shawn Frigé, which they're white and they're fluffy and they look like stuffed animals. And then poodles, which are cousins of them. So they have the least amount of dander, smell, they just have, they just, anyway, I did so much research because I have asthma and allergies.
00:11:00 - Laura L
And it's me too.
00:11:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, sign is clean. Oh, yes. And if I'm on a cat, I will literally get pneumonia and die. They're terrible. I've been in the hospital because of them. So let's see. Okay, I don't, what I want to see is an example. Why do people not just do like, Hey, this is what it looks like inside for the community. They realize that images do the selling for them. Apparently, I'm not. To teach them how to do the better job. Okay, let's see, um, teachable circle, like circle and teachable as an example. Now I don't want that. I just want a picture that looks like a community area. So I can see what it looks like. That might be one of those images. Go away, blah, blah, This looks like a Facebook group. It does. Yeah, it is Facebook group. Well, click bait, I'm just kidding. Um, come on, people, I have to make a decision here. And get the app store. I do want to kind of see this, but what are their integrations? Like what's the name? Xavier Mailton. Okay, spec. Okay. Let's see if we do this. Okay. Examples, five successful online community examples. That just looks like a straight up form, which is okay. We are there so that's a Facebook group.
00:13:37 - Laura L
was wondering if we could like customize the look.
00:13:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's that's part of what I want to know. So let's see what they do online courses, membership community. Maybe very quick on the links you see here. My post review on the introduction general trial. Okay, let's escape the algorithm teaching conversation happens in a form that you control students will be distracted by the rest of the news feed conversations at the center boost value Okay, um once again all right um so it says it's easy to customize we're waiting so and of course it's coaching see
00:15:01 - Laura L
If they have like a free trial, maybe we could avail the free trial and can't steal any time.
00:15:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. And that's really how I like to do it is I like to log in and see what it looks like and play around with it.
00:15:17 - Laura L
How much time do you have right now? Yeah, I'm still available. work with my other projects in the afternoon.
00:15:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Do you have like at least 30 minutes?
00:15:28 - Laura L
Yeah.
00:15:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Great. why don't we just set up a couple of accounts, one with each of them right now. And let's see. No. What? Last pass. Pick a password for us. Wait. Seriously. Create that account. Yes, are you already teaching, are you already teaching, I'm not a platform. There is your current audience size. It's only how much money do you make charging for your knowledge? Well, that's none of your business. How much content or training materials have you already prepared a little bit? Oh, I hired a video editor today and hopefully I think she'll be pretty good. So I'm trying to get all the pieces in place. Wait, how much time can you spend on teachable courses? Choose your product online course coaching. Now, I want it all. we'll do this. I just want to explore teachable for now. Okay, let's do that. Because the priority is the course, but oh yeah, add that.
00:17:28 - Laura L
Okay.
00:17:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, there's course in community. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I'll just call it that. online, it's started to create digital download, create a community. I'm not worried. I think the courses is going to be really straightforward. It's just going to be pages and containers. Yeah, let's look at the community first and then we can come back to the course. course. The community you want, whatever, you can't see it. Okay, without upgrading, not yet enabled. All right, to create it, I'm facing as well as use by our AI schools. Let me go to chat to the team and see where I have the search works. I'm going to get something here and plug in a little bit. I don't want to use AI to generate outline, I've already got that. That's cool. I might be sold already. Cause I love using AI and integrating, especially because I'm, I'm good at training it. And the, the biggest thing that it does for me is it basically gets rid of the blank screen. Like I don't want it to write for me. It can't write as good as I can. It can't teach as good as I can. But what it does for me, and I think that my favorite thing about AI is it starts, you get traction, you know, and you're like, Oh, I think, cause one of the things I teach in my business, and this is something that you can think about when, when you think about what you want to build, almost always, almost always Laura, when I ask people what they want, they're really non specific. And they have a really hard time saying, I very specifically want this business. And, but when I ask them, okay, what do you not want it to be? A lot of times it's the same kind of answer. But when I ask them things like, do you want to have to work 80 hours a week? Absolutely not. Do you want to work on the weekends? Not really. Do you want to work at night? Not really. Do you want to be available to the people that you work with 24 seven not really do you want to only make $2,000 a month? No, you know what I mean? Like so you start doing that and you go Oh, okay So I want to be able to work mostly Monday through Friday from X amount of time and I needed to give me at least you know $4,000 a month or something like that so you start with that and then so so when you find the where things cross over Meaning so if you're only going to work, let's say 20 to 30 hours a week and not more than that because Statistics show that if you work more than 20 hours a week productivity actually and creativity start to dip So if you want to have a most leveraged type of work life then you want to keep it under under 30 hours between 20 and 30 hours and If you need to make at least $4,000 a month And you can only work 20 to 30 hours a week. So now you have have some simple math, right? let's say 25 hours a week times four weeks, that's 100 hours a week. And now let's say you need to make $4,000, which is going to be $40 an hour, basically $4,500, $40 an hour. So you need your effective hourly rate to be $40 an hour. Well, or, so you can do that an hourly rate, right? If you were taking hourly type clients and work, or you could say you need $4,000 a month, and maybe you want to have a subscription. So how many people do you need at $40 a month, you need 100 people. And then you have to allow for a term. So let's say a 20% term. So you want to aim for about 55, 60 people at $40 a month. And then you have your $4,000. And you won't be working more than you want to, as long as you're doing a good job with things. So. Anyway, that's what clarity does and the thing that I like about AI is that AI doesn't feel anything. It can't be offended, but it will get things started and you can ask questions or get it to ask you questions. But yeah, anyway, so that's the thing. All right, let's go. I'm just, I'm pretty much just sold on this, but let's just go check out Teachable. So that was think epic, right? No, that's as well. Teachable. Okay, so think epic. Make the leap. Let's see, get started for free. Let's see what you have. I'm not really like, like you can just really top that.
00:23:52 - Laura L
The one you're impressed with the Teachable is the AI thing that generates, or I mean, the outline of the course.
00:23:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's pretty cool. It was, but so there's multiple things that that tells me because they've already integrated it and they've integrated it and the outline was so good and it was so clean. What I know is they know people and they know training and they know the technology. So like as a business owner, one of the things that I look at when I'm choosing a software platform is how long it's been around and what do they know? How good are they at understanding their own business so that I know that they're going to be around. Like a lot of people are price shopping, they're looking for pretty things, they're looking for integrations and I'm looking for can you keep growing with me so that I don't have to start over and are you going to support my customers in the way that I want them to be supported.
00:24:58 - Laura L
Yeah. Okay. best part is still. I mean, free plan and they already show what they feel.
00:25:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Exactly. Exactly. that's that's pretty powerful. So this is very interesting because they obviously have AI too. Let's see what let's see what they do. impressed me. I dare you. Come on. Locking down key learning objectives.
00:25:30 - Laura L
Oh, there's also a little new page.
00:25:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. import, setting, strip, after purchase. Hold on a minute now. Let's go look at this. your course, create a pricing plan. Sales page. Let's see what you have for a sales page. Wow. Holy heck.
00:25:56 - Laura L
Yeah, very it's me. easier.
00:26:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. Wow. Okay, I'm so impressed with both of these. Okay, so already has a sales page. Um, this is pretty awesome. So I like how it does this publish, build a landing page. Let's see what this looks like.
00:26:29 - Laura L
Okay.
00:26:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, yeah, that's, that's simple for building it. That's, that's going to be you. We can look at it more if you want to. What I want to see is, um, because what Teachable did it already had a sales page and you can edit like there's, so we would just basically, and it's kind of parallax away. Oh, yeah.
00:26:57 - Laura L
So, yeah, change the.
00:27:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You would change the change of stuff, but it's already got a very familiar professional type feel that people are people seen before.
00:27:14 - Laura L
Yeah, like layout. It's already blocked.
00:27:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so why do I keep going and build a landing page. Just look at that again. And then of course new course. Yeah, so just the fact that it gives you starter. Yeah, so it's like you are overwhelmed. Yeah, so it gives you example. Hey, here's what this image could look like. Tweet the colors, you know, this type of stuff and it gives you, yeah, I'm okay. Okay. Add new blocks. Let's see what kind of blocks they have. text by the video email each form image with text down our text image with grid pricing. Let's see the pricing. Oh, set a price. We can do that. Let's just come up with free. We'll just call it free. Free. Every plan. And then out of pricing plan. One time purchase was 497. I have no idea. Okay. That. And then we're going to add one more. I'm going to call this subscription. I'm going call this 97. something like that every month. Whatever. We really are going to fix everything and just want to see what this looks like. So.
00:28:53 - Laura L
Okay. Maybe.
00:28:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it might, but I want it. want to see if it does or not. So. let's see content. Oh, we'll go back to that. And then pricing, pressing plans. Okay. So did it create the block? She's a pricing option three. Oh, okay. One, three, and where are you seven? Let's keep you. Okay. Now what? More. Okay. there's content here. I don't really like the pricing block.
00:29:32 - Laura L
Yeah, maybe it needs to be like adding an element like rose.
00:29:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you know, I like the pricing blocks where there's where they're side by side, and there's three of them. There's one in the middle and that is strategically and psychologically, people tend to pick the thing that's in the middle.
00:29:52 - Laura L
Yeah, maybe we could fix that like other.
00:29:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It would allow us to customize. Yeah, so let's do this. Was that think of a carteachable of teachable, right? Yeah, so Custom pricing blocks. We'll see if there's different pressure products use custom sales page blocks on teachable I mean because you could probably add some HTML code, okay Yeah, sets blocks Oh, they have code for you to just copy and paste there How do I add custom HTML to a teachable sales page and then HTML, okay, so um You I think you said that one of the things was here peer, limited design customization, oh fees, yeah, period, basic plan. But I don't have to use their sales page. The only time I really care about formatting is for a sales page or like an opt-in page. So that's not a big deal really. That's not a big deal. Because we could use WordPress for that and aligning page beyond WordPress. Yeah, okay. Sales pages. Check up page. I wonder if they have different builds from template, generate from AI. I just should imagine though the blocks they have or the blocks they have.
00:32:13 - Laura L
How about their default pricing?
00:32:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There wasn't anything. That's why it said you have to add prices and then this is all it had. This is it designs you can change this type of stuff so what I don't see though is HTML so can you let's see what happens if you copy some of that it. Is this the one that had some custom code?
00:33:07 - Laura L
Yeah.
00:33:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And see if it just, I mean, I would not think it would take code here, but nope. Yeah, so but again, anyway, I actually don't care about that. I don't care about that. Um, so the thing, um, like for delivering the content, it just needs to be easy access properly, like a magic link. So, and you said teachable how the magic link. Yep. Design templates, serve the certificates. Oh my gosh, we can talk. So just a bit of coupons. I like coupons. Upsell funnel. I don't necessarily care about that because I might just do something like even like WooCommerce something or funnel kit. for selling. I'm just known ships. Okay, so think Epic then. Products, channels, marketing. It's not really care about trip yet. So users analytics, analytics. I do care about analytics and engagement. That's important to me. Oh, I wonder if reports, lesson completion. Okay, so I get quiz scores, leaderboards, and lesson completion. That's that's some kind of stats. Okay, see average course completion rates. That's something. And I probably couldn't put Google Analytics on there. I wonder if they'll let you go. Let's do this. Can we put G, A, or on... That was teachable. I mean, keep forgetting. Can I Google Analytics for to teachable Zapier and I'm in planner. But I wonder if you can do it in the courses, not just the landing page. On your teachable school, set up a thank you page for each course. So it's a fine variables in the Google time manager. Okay, that's what I want. Because I do want to be able to track interaction. I don't want to sell something to people and then they're are not using it. That kind of is the way it goes. People always spend money on stuff and a lot of fun. They just don't do it. And, you know, they sign up for gyms and they don't go to the gym, you know? But I would like to be able to see what works well, what content is most engaging. And um, okay. So I'm really feeling teachable. What would you like us to look at anything else?
00:36:34 - Laura L
Um, let me check. There's one. Let me go back to this sheet.
00:36:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay.
00:36:47 - Laura L
There's one that, um, all the memberful memberful. Yeah, that's number one. But it's limited design customization.
00:37:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And overview, well, I already like that because it makes me feel like they've got AI. I've already used that, let's see. Apple Pay and Google Pay, coupons discounts, VMP, group plans, one-time payments. Monthly annual weekly, I like that. Two, that's pretty awesome. Cancellation surveys, referral program, growth metrics, I'm reporting. Wow, well, try for free. I guess, why aren't you triggering a copy, paste? Did I have one before already? duplicated it right now in your site, profit to others before.com. Well, let's see, revenue, things, things, content, podcast downloads, community, I do not want to do this card, members, subscriptions, activities, websites, websites. Yeah, this is, it's not really poor or online course, right?
00:38:42 - Laura L
It's what? It's not really for online courses.
00:38:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't think look like it. Welcome, I was just checking in for another credit gift.
00:38:55 - Laura L
Oh, okay.
00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's great. I mean, it sounded like it was a number thing.
00:39:05 - Laura L
Yeah, it's like a membership site.
00:39:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. Intense podcast downloads. Create a new download. Community. Okay. Okay. Huh. I mean, it's interesting, but it's not what I'm looking for. I just want to say connect to my words. It looks like it's mostly just like a paid community.
00:40:00 - Laura L
Yeah, maybe easy course then you can disregard that. thought it was like for online courses.
00:40:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You definitely don't want Kajabi.
00:40:19 - Laura L
I think it's easy course. It's like a competitor for the job. See features.
00:40:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so this is the one sales funnels affiliate program online courses website builder. But it doesn't say community. Um, working emails, build websites, magic lights, create online courses. One more. Uh, we'll see that's what it doesn't look like it's got community. So So it doesn't even let you actually see it without, let's see, it does. Hey, my name is Bill from FunnelScene.com. And that's pretty much it. It's actually how you can go. So let's go here and create a new community community. Okay, I am. We'll look at that one more time. Pricing. Oh, communities. There it is. Unlimited. Start for free. Contact. Sales funnel. Courses. One quick upsells order bumps. Deadline funnels. There's a lot of different pay integrations. The program custom domains. Say anything about AI stuff. All right. My busy. See? Let's see this does, or use AI tools.
00:43:34 - Laura L
Oh, you can integrate it by the exact year?
00:43:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that is good. always appreciate that. Well, let's see. What is that? Oh, it's there. See. There's this free and then, and then, yeah, so I guess sort of a very, we did, I already create one, I don't know, okay for that password, I'm Wrong one. No, I need this. I see the password. No, not that. No, no. I'm Let's just look at Let's just look this. Products. Add a new course. I'm thinking. I'm It's not going to have AI, which, well, sorry. Okay, let's see.
00:46:30 - Laura L
I need to build it.
00:46:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, this is, this is, I mean, it's just not anything compared to the others. So let me just go cancel that subscription really quick. Make sure I'm not charged flex. don't want it. And. That is my subscriptions. So. Are you sure you're on that? I'm going to subscribe. Okay. All right. so that was all that I wanted to look at. These two I was really familiar with. I've heard of that. I don't want Kajabi way too limited. Um, some of the other ones were like, but I don't know if they had magic links. And so I don't want to really go into that, but it was, um, Sergio. I don't know if they have it. No magic link. They do have magic link. And Sergio, let's see. The force. Let's see, was actually looking at this coaching creators, as long as to was surprising. I'm pretty happy with Teachable, actually. Yeah, so wait, that was, I can't like, but it's a whole other thing, but I do like the analytics. don't it. I like that. Oh. But what was the, they had communities, right, or we couldn't, we couldn't see it, products, home products, communities, spaces, organize, engage with threads interacting. Oh, I like that.
00:49:41 - Laura L
That looks very, that's like Facebook. Yeah. There's trade forward.
00:49:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. How much a welcome post of your profile. Wow. Okay. Making it hard. Okay, so they also had the AI set up, but, okay, I've got to close some browser windows so I can just stay where they say they have multiple browsers. I always, and let me show you this because, well, again, so this is actually my tab manager. All of these are different tab settings and each one of them probably have like 50 tabs opening. Like, this is my Etsy store one. What's all the tabs changed?
00:50:37 - Laura L
Yeah, oh my goodness. Yes, eating all the, I mean, eating big memories in the computer.
00:50:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but the cool thing is about this is that when I, when it would be better, which I'm never better. I could just have spaces so I don't keep everything open, but I just forget to switch between spaces. I do use it for for my clients like so I keep theirs. Nope, I don't keep theirs clean either. It helps because it's better like 50 tabs than 250 tabs which I've done. And that doesn't work out very well. Okay, so let me okay create your curriculum. I really love this. Let's look at there. It wouldn't let me see community, right? That was the thing.
00:51:28 - Laura L
Yeah.
00:51:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, so let me just analytics this will all pay plans in case and I'm limited. Let's do this. And then if I have to get a refund, I'll get a refund. All right, I'm going to stop sharing for . You're back. Well, I'm here. I mean, I'm here, but you know, Well, we're going go away. Okay. No. A card. It's going to take a second because I want to see it because if this has a community that's similar than I for sure want teachable but Because it is better creating AI and I really like that, which will help me a lot. But I also have you to help out. So, um, for in terms of like actually setting up the pages, which is the one thing, because this already had the fill in the blanks, basically. Yeah, yes, I'm to. Yeah. But you have skill and you don't. Need that we could we could find something that we like to model after anyway. Wait, I should use to keep on. think I have one, but that's okay. And come back to sharing screen. Continue to the building. Why are we on building? I want to go to Okay, so immunities. Which one are you this? Create your community. Okay, don't worry, you can always show us later. Here, create. There we go. Alrighty then. Well, that's a little underwhelming. Okay, so let's go back to this then.
00:54:22 - Laura L
I mean, this is really awesome.
00:54:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay, back to my dashboard. All my products, my dashboard. That's nice. So that's what the users will see when they log in their community and their courses. I like that. Okay, so go back to the site builder. And I like that it's got a mobile builder too. So you can see what that looks like. Oh wait, it already has, oh let's go to this, oh it does have content, it's just not, it's just not as graphic intense and it has, it's just not as pretty I guess, so headings down this is also has CSS, did you see that? No I didn't, maybe if we add block, yes think checkup pages, button collection, I don't really have, let's just button back, theme settings, styles, not a lot, which I think, oh okay, let's try this.
00:56:00 - Laura L
Okay.
00:56:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's something that was in Manhattan. That's Parker. Okay. but. If this is not the sales page, if this is just the course welcome page, that's okay. You know, it really don't care about it. Being too much. Welcome. Build a landing page. That's where we were at.
00:56:36 - Laura L
Right. Yeah. What happened if we click add section.
00:56:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here. Additional products, all categories of pricing options. Maybe they have better pricing options too. Pricing options. That. putting button background on layout. Okay, there's column two columns.
00:57:04 - Laura L
like that.
00:57:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Still not a lot of control for that. But again, I don't have to use this as the sales page. I don't think, I don't know. So, let me look at this. Can you separate sales page? You can listen to link directly to check out. Yeah, that would make sense. Yeah. Redirect, I think, get the page to your external sales page. Okay, I think it's at least sort of starting on. So let's go back to Teachable and see if it's got the community ready for us. What? Or else? Lame. Let me check the Gmail. Teachable. Welcome to the number four. Nope. Well, I wonder. It said it can take a few minutes. Okay, so let's give it a little more time. So of course it's coaching, right? Managing coaching experiences. would like to see this. We're, let's see, we'll do a hybrid. No intake form. And then go to check out and be enrolled, so now approval, one-time purchase, get a plan subscription, like this, this, two-point-seven, continue, fine. I'm definitely going to to change everything if we use this on the enrollment date. Customize your first milestone is often used to open the client and prepare them for coaching session. Add scheduling, p6, I really don't want to use their sales features. That's not what I'm looking for most. It's the community, the magic link login is super important, the most important really of all things, the magic link and that the content is easy to deliver and that it's mobile friendly. site pages, comments, text, go back, go here. Oh, yay. Okay. you community. Oh, how. Okay. All. All. All. All. All. All. I wonder if I could log in with my um, teachable. Tina Marie's school, so the welcome email is or like the email that they send is a nice. Looks like this, basically. Hear your school. You know. Oh, my heck. Okay. Okay. Okay, so, I'll products my products preview us public preview us student I like my membership. Yeah, I definitely like the think ethic um community better.
01:02:23 - Laura L
Yeah, it's very straightforward forward it is here too.
01:02:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and I um discard it. So, just come on some more time. Just, I mean, they'll be there. It looks so months like Facebook.
01:02:49 - Laura L
Yeah. Great thinking that is it basically out.
01:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, and that's what buddy boss does also or yeah buddy boss, but it's so much more are expensive, and it doesn't have the AI stuff powered on. So I'll go ahead and then cancel this. Settings. Oh, that's not what I want.
01:03:16 - Laura L
Maybe.
01:03:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Really nice.
01:03:19 - Laura L
What's that? Under billing, if you wanted to cancel.
01:03:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
01:03:23 - Laura L
Yeah.
01:03:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Manage really in the card. And it's plan, cancel plan. No. Well, please choose option. Why did I not want this? Oh, the community was better. I don't I think. Take. Oh, going to do my out. It's better. That was the selling factor. Yeah, sure, because if you'll change it, then that's good. Okay, so. I'm going to stop share for a second. I'm going go to the last pass. And about. Open my boat. And I'll share. Let's see. Think of it. Or teachable think of it. Okay. Oh, wait. So one second. This is, I don't know if they're going to do to back draw authentication. That's teachable. this is. Can I? I don't remember. If I can create an admin account for you, like a team kind of thing. So, account, account management, billing, subscription plans, I'm not a free plan. I'm totally upgrading right now. One administrator, two administrators, one community, service and transaction. Let me pick which one I want here. represent lessons, certificates, memberships and bundles. We'll start with this. One of them, so that's going to be $100 a month, and we need to upgrade to it right now in the community. One them Okay, I will go to this, I'm not moving into that yet. So, it was share. Oh, there you are. Sure. Okay. So that task is complete. Yay.
01:07:09 - Laura L
Oh, sure.
01:07:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We'll share again. Okay. now I have to make a decision, though, about sales pages, and what I would like to do for quick. Like, WordPress, like fast loading WordPress sales page builder. think it would probably be like. Oh, Divi. D.I. V.I. Divi. Are you good with that?
01:08:01 - Laura L
Because I am not. I tried, but it's for a blog posting though.
01:08:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's the four sales. Yeah, no, I, I'm really interested in something that's for sales. I'm high converting landing pages. So. Let's see. And I think I already have a mentor and I pay for it. Let's sign them. Let's share. Log in. Let me search maybe not real quick. I'm almost positive. Elementor. Let's see. There's my. I wonder if I did it with. All And you want to count that wall and see. Okay. See how it not takes. There. So. So. So. So. Well. So. Tables. Well. I click too fast. So yeah, this was what I was thinking about. This type of thing. So we can do this with elements. All right. And back to log in, see if I got my, nope, it's not reset my thing. So see if we can get loops. And on my hack, I just closed it. One accident. No. Okay, open everything back up for me. I think it was, I don't remember which one it was, I think it was in this time. Oh, did it stop sharing when I closed it? Yeah. Oh, sorry. Because I accidentally closed the window and what happened.
01:11:00 - Laura L
Yeah, can see now.
01:11:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, No, that's not right. No, that's not right. Yeah. still didn't send it. Got password. Okay. Okay, under what will happen if I try to log in with Google. I don't think that that's how I did it. We'll see if it's a new account. So I feel like I might have some licenses. I'm not Are you going to junk? Up here. Elementor, we say your password. Okay. All right. should have decided that I should have done. Okay. I'm going to do it from different browser, so let's see, this is one, maybe it'll Now we should be done, we'll be done, let's see, generator, password, Did you copy, did let's see password Okay, so back here, I'm on my tour, refresh, so don't want to do it now, now. I won't see maybe if I refresh here. Listen here, I want to come in. I am on a call to sooner. Huh? No, I can make it, hold on. You Okay, my daughter is going to bed and saying good night. Joke mail, here's your verification. You say your password. But recent verification. You say Hopefully, that will come, but it should be able to send us services, brand and business Hopefully, I'm sharing the right thing with you. Share Elementor with you. And what I would like is. To see some options for landing pages. The new Basically sales pages. So the things that I want like I like this, what I've got nice blog. box where there's feature blocks and there's some parallax, you know, where you scroll down and there's different colors. I like the pricing blocks that look like the one that I showed you where there's three side by side.
01:17:17 - Laura L
Do you remember that?
01:17:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Oh, shoot. Okay. So my brain goes all over the place. really what I want to say is like, okay, Tina, I need you to buy this or get this or whatever so that we can build a good sales page. And then we have kind of a I don't have all the content put together yet, but my brain will work best if I can kind of have like I was talking about before kind of a home and a house for it and then and then I can fill in the blanks easier so um yeah is there a particular page or sales page that you want me to model or how it's not what I was trying to think about so let's see um let's see um let's don't know you don't want that, skill chain, I don't want that show for a while because there's going to be a love next step um Let's see. see. I like this. A lot.
01:19:41 - Laura L
50 page.
01:19:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah but so what I like about it is the movement. And that it's very eye-catching. want to let me go see what it looks like on the novel real quick. It looks fantastic on mobile and all of those things pop too so that all the movement catches eyes and it just keeps people interested and the color is really good too. So, let's see, Kajabi storefront, that's Kajabi, that's shocking to me, it's interesting.
01:20:47 - Laura L
Yeah, in Kajabi page builder, there's kind of animation.
01:21:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I do not want to build on Kajabi. just don't. So let's see. They also watch her. Oh yeah.
01:21:28 - Laura L
Yeah.
01:21:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
See all the movement.
01:21:44 - Laura L
Yeah.
01:21:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And when you log into her course, there's this like confetti explosion too. I'm just trying to think of some other names that we do. All the movement. All of them have movement. Oops. That'll work. DIVI theme. Kinta blocks. So this is built on Let me think of a few more. One of the key to using this. Okay, let's get social. Social media. Social media. Okay. And that's okay. It's not great. That works. There's a space book. Well, so James is actually really. I like that. And I feel like. I've seen these types of animations. think elements are can do stuff like this. Yes. I might even already have it in. See what's Thank you. I don't have it on this one, maybe it was Tina Marie dot com. I know I have it, okay, so did I share this?
01:25:52 - Laura L
With you, I don't know if you have this access. Oh, I not yet, only the profit driver.
01:25:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Share with you. because then you can play with an element or a little bit and see if we can get something similar to jameswedmoretraining.com.
01:26:11 - Laura L
You want me to copy and paste that to.
01:26:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, check for chat. Yep. Chat. And we'll just over here. Chat window element or emphasize performance with our optimal speed boosting features. Yeah, we like that. Create a page. Magical pose. I don't want to post on page. They have so many things animated headline. Oh, yeah, I like that one. And there were different, so highlighted, rotating, like that, see, where do I go back? Settings, Style, Advanced, Paint Builder, User Preferences, and so let's do this. Hi, this page, I don't, that's not what I want, I want the the heading call to action. Not moved, I like that. So, section dot, so elementary templates might be a thing. Basically, if you could do some research and figure out how we could use elementary to have moving things so that moved. left to right. That was what was this one? What did they do? Like it got bigger and small to big or just appeared. That's not a lot. That did the same thing. That moved left to right. The first one that went right to left. So they're just tiny animations. That's really it. And then it's got these nice testimonial blocks and has a gradient background. Which we don't necessarily need to copy and definitely don't want to copy the colors but I do like the gradient background. Here's the thing that's tricky about him is he's using feminine colors to attract mostly females and because he does really good with them. He's really nice. You thank you. Super nice guy. I went one my friends introduced me to him and we were supposed to take a picture of us and instead he took a selfie. So I've got pictures of him on my phone, um, working me. What does that look like? No, my programs. Yeah, so there's, oh, that's nice. But that is really powerful and keeping people's attention and getting them to look at it for a while and not get bored and with people in business they tend to have ADHD. so movement actually draws their attention rather than distracts them and keeps them engaged longer. So your assignment then would be to just get familiar with Thinkific and, um, Elementor and see how we could build a landing page like this. Also, So these are colors that I have been using and we can start with this. can, I can actually add you to my Canva team or I can just share specific things with you. However, it might be useful to you because then you can grab a logo. You can look at the fonts. You can get colors. I am so tired right now. can even think anymore. Teams, I think I have room for one more. Where do I add? I don't remember invite people. too much for people to identify and more people. I don't think I need everybody that I've got in there, so I don't know how to manage them. I'm too tired. I'll have to do that later. This was a lot. Thank you so much for just being here. So tasks for Trello just see what you can do to duplicate the not duplicate but kind of pattern after this layout of just so I don't know what that is open image in new tab. Let me take a look at that. Okay, and so that fades out is what that does. So that's the image and then this is just plain background. the text. Being able to have movement like that, if you could find out way to do that, that would be amazing. And obviously, we don't have like that exact image or anything like it, but figure out what to use it.
01:33:18 - Laura L
How to duplicate the movement?
01:33:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, is it a divider that's a GIF or how do they do that? And yeah, I'd be very interested to know. But if we can't do something like that, that's okay. But we do want to create movement in every section. So if you want to like note that movement in every section of a sales page or a landing page. So if it's an opt-in page or that or sales page, then we want to create movement in every Reception and even this though there's no movements. There is kind of because the edge pulls the eye from left to right because of the gradients. So the colors. They don't physically move with the eyes move if that makes sense.
01:34:16 - Laura L
Yep.
01:34:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And then whatever you can explore in in think epic and I would love it just if you have some questions if we have a little more Interaction this week because there isn't a super specific task other than exploration. So if you have questions or, you know, like help with that. Okay. What's next kind of thing. Here's what I think That will help me a ton because but right now I'm fried.
01:34:46 - Laura L
can't think anymore. Yeah, just play around with think epic and elementary then you know, Perfect.
01:34:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Thank you so much, Laura.
01:35:00 - Laura L
was
01:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
forward to talking to you again and I'm going to go get ready for bed.
01:35:03 - Laura L
Okay. Yeah. Thank you, Tina.

Oh, nice.
00:00:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I'm very excited about it. But I have this people that build my deck did not build it right. And so it's very creaky. It's not always been creaky. And that's where I work. And it's driving me bonkers. So now I have to deal with people coming in and out and probably doggies and the doggies like to play tag with the deer around here. They will chase each other up and down the fence. Because if we had some baby deer that were born and they used to sleep under my porch and they've grown up around my dogs.
00:00:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And they will so cool.
00:00:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Chase my dogs and my dogs will chase them. But my dogs will be barking their heads up while it's happening. So it's cute. But also my brain.
00:00:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I love it though.
00:00:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's like deer.
00:00:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Are you kidding me? I remember when I lived in Florida, the golf course community we had deer in our backyard some mornings and beautiful to watch.
00:00:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But they're actually living there. That's That's so cool. I will show you, I'm going to text you a picture of these so you can just kind of see the area.
00:01:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
These are my kiddos and my daughter.
00:01:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going grab my Turn it on. Well, that is my two youngest daughters and my, the one in the back, that's her boyfriend helping them build it. And there's also a tree house that I had built for them up there, which is huge. It's got astroturf and lights inside and papisane chairs and we can see the whole city and It doesn't take a while to get to me because I just turn you on So but so where do you live exactly? Southern Oregon Okay, and so you call it if I'm a falls. It's a dinky little Redneck town is what it is a hillbilly place, and I can't wait to leave but I had babies here, so Years and and so do you have like a big backyard so that though? It's not very big actually so we were resting for a long time after I got divorced I basically found the safest place I could as fast as I could and then they sold it and I didn't get much notice So I had two months to find Finance and close our house Which is that almost snow time. And the criteria primarily was be in our church ward and in our same school district.
00:03:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So that limited it tremendously.
00:03:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it was a beautiful house and it was brand new. So nobody's lived in it. And it's on a hill, which is crazy in the winter because we get a lot of snow. But my kids went from playing outside and playing basketball all the time to day stops playing outside immediately. only moved the block away. But because of the steepness of the hill, these lazy kiddos would not walk up it. So they stopped playing. There's no neighbors that talk and visit. And it's beautiful, but it's just I need them to be where they're engaging with people more and okay, pros and cons to everything.
00:03:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah. So this one they're building.
00:03:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are they building in this picture? That's a gazebo.
00:03:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So it's going to be it's
00:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
going to be, see if I can find a picture to show you what it's going to be, because I also have a really nice couch that goes outside, but the pine tree just keeps dripping sap on it. Well, it would if I didn't keep it covered all the time, but because I keep it covered all the time, nobody wants to deal with the cover and take it off. so this has netting on it. We also have a smoker grill out there, but this is what they're building.
00:04:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, it's going to be gorgeous idea.
00:04:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I already have the lights and everything.
00:04:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Cool.
00:04:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The fairy lights. Yes.
00:04:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I bought this big like wicker egg chair that is. seen those.
00:04:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. So making our, I'm a, I'm a homemaker. That's my money goes to home and family and traveling.
00:04:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's it. I love it. Yeah. We redid our whole backyard last year to want to make it look like an English magical garden. So we have that we we might still. We'll do the gazebo. We said no at first when the designer suggested it. But just because it's mostly evening when I want to be out there.
00:05:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Come here. Come here. Come here.
00:05:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that dear.
00:05:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't say hi.
00:05:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, cute.
00:05:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's my that's my Baha'nies boy. Okay.
00:05:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
English, English garden.
00:05:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I saw picture with your mom or a video. She was smelling her roses and it looked so peaceful and nice back there.
00:05:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It is. Yeah. We're in a really small town here too in Canada. yeah, it's nice. And my mom's backyard. Actually, I worked from her house yesterday afternoon and she was just cute thing because like she goes to take a nap in the afternoon and then and it was really bad rain. Like we've had flooding here and everything. But it. So you're not at about three o'clock yesterday, all of a sudden five o'clock, she comes down and her bathing suit like, what are you doing? It's five o'clock and she goes, I'm going for a swim. I'm tired of being inside the house all day. know, I'm like, Mom, you have more energy than me.
00:06:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you're amazing. It's the naps, Maria.
00:06:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
powerful. It must be because I was just amazed. was just like, here she comes. she's 88 years old and she just, yeah, come down down and get her bathing suit and just goes and swims, jumps in the pool. I'm like, Oh my God. And then she's like, how come you don't have bathing suit here? So I know, you know what? I'm going to go buy second one and just keep it there. Cause I probably would have joined her, right?
00:06:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I told my friend to do. Cause I have a friend and she comes in Queens for me on Friday because she's amazing and an organizer and so smart. Anyway, I talked her into it and pay her good, but I'm like, I'm swimming with me. yeah, yeah, like that water sunshine. I don't need a lot else.
00:06:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. know, that's right.
00:06:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I've been excited about this. I tried to be productive. I'm telling you, the beginning of my existence is not having people to work with. It didn't used to be a problem for me, but the older I get, the more it gets like that. I think part of it also is after getting into this transitionary phase, I really feel my emotions coming on, I'm annoyed by it. But since my older girls have moved out and I haven't had the chaos at home. And the energy of all these people, because I left the workplace, that was difficult. Then the kids got bigger, know, I had four of them. And so that filled me up. But now they're gone most of time. The two are the two oldest are gone all the time and the two youngest are gone most of the time. And so I wasn't aware of how much I was feeding off of their energy, even when they weren't in the room.
00:08:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Got it. Got it.
00:08:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's annoying. I'm not really a cry baby, but like my emotions are I worked so hard to not suppress them anymore.
00:08:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I purposely let them be free, but it's really annoying when it's this one.
00:08:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'll cry when I'm mad. I'll cry when I'm happy.
00:08:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'll cry when away.
00:08:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So like, I've got to figure out. I don't have enough work to hire somebody regularly. And I'm like, if I just get one more client, I'll just pay somebody just to sit there with me.
00:08:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But I need riffing.
00:08:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need somebody to sit there and hammer things out. And I've never needed that before, because I had energy around me. I didn't know that I was literally drawing energy from their presence, even just being in the house. But I'm very conscious of but now because I noticed when I'm productive, it's when they're here and they're busy doing stuff, even if we're not together, I'm like, I can do stuff. They'll be gone all week long. And I'm like, I'm gonna get so much stuff done, get nothing done. The second they get home, like, boop, boop, boop, boop.
00:09:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, interesting. Yeah, so that's where I've been, like I'm not really not getting a lot done, but I did work with chat GBT last night.
00:09:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get these little spurts where something pops to my brain and I will capture it. But that's basically as productive as it gets. I won't sit down and do things. But because you asked me, let me go to my notes here. to be crying, whatever. me look somewhere from my face, stop the leap. What are you, what's that? There's a child. Anyway, so talking about a welcome video, you said to think about video training and structure. so what I was thinking, Let me close this, is that, sorry, I'm not on my normal computer, I'm on my laptop, so I have to kind of like organize everything better for this to crank drive minutes. So, think about video training and structure, and so, I was thinking about this, and I think that no matter what entry point, somebody comes in with me, there are, there are going to be some key principles that I want them to understand before we go forward, because I want them to complete whatever they came here for, because it's always their time otherwise. And so, the thing that I know, wow, that was, sorry, okay, the thing that I know is that, in order for us to do things, we have to be committed to it, so we have to buy into it. Otherwise, it's just a momentary fluke, you know, they're in the moment, like how many times Time is your brain committed to something and your 10 minutes later is like, I'm not the same person.
00:11:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We're not doing that. Yeah.
00:11:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but if I get buy-in, I kind of get buy-in to the spirit, not just the energy of that moment. So, I think in the beginning, I want to tell them when they get there, okay, so and so you sign up for this, whether it's paid or free, whatever it is that we're doing. And the reason that you did it is because there's a result that you want. And there's a result that you want because there's something missing that you don't have or there's something present that you don't want or both. Okay. So, here's how we're going to get it, but let me explain to you why working with me and going through what I'm teaching you is a little bit different. I'm going to explain to you leverage. And I'm going to explain it very quickly, explain what a lever is, and explain how it's doing working you. that's almost impossible making it very simple by applying pressure to a device, a device being a system, a structure, a process, whatever. But I'm actually going to have like a little picture or maybe a jiff that shows a very simple lever, a stick, a rock, a heavy thing, and they're like, you can't move the rock and then you push pressure on the lever, boom, the rock goes up. That's leverage. Most people are not ever thinking about leverage. And if they are thinking about it, it's not constantly, it's not persistently, it's not intentionally. Because everything that I do is leveraged, always looking to increase my leverage. I'm always, people talk about working smarter, not harder, but how do you do it? It's levers. It is what devices can you use that gets more from less. So I want to teach that to them very quickly. Like we just cover that maybe two minutes, but they should be engaged in it. Most of their brain. are going to be like, you were listening, they're probably going to be listening, like, I can get more from less. And you're telling me how people always tell me I should, but they don't tell me how.
00:13:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah.
00:13:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or why it's simple or why it can happen. So they just learn something new. first few seconds that they're there with me.
00:13:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:13:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The next thing is I'm going to tell them I need you to consider energy. This is a resource that we all have. But as you know, it fluctuates. It's sometimes unreliable. It's sometimes not there when you need it to be. But most people think about energy retroactively. I want them to think of it proactively. I am always thinking about energy. I am thinking about tomorrow's energy today. And I'm doing everything I can to maximize today's energy and tomorrow's energy and making my choices consciously so that I have sufficient, if not, plenty of energy to be able to do all the things that are most important to me. And then the next thing I'll tell them about priorities because how do I have energy for the things that are most important to me if I have it consciously and intentionally chosen what is most important to me. So, so-and-so name, we're going to go through an exercise, a series of exercises that are very quick, that are very succinct like the things that I just explained to you that are going to help you sort and filter the current activities that you have so that you can learn how to prioritize them and so that you can learn how to leverage your time to get the most out of it in the least amount of effort as well as maximize your energy. And this might seem like a big ask and that it's a lot to do but what I can tell you is and I promise you that if you will spend whatever time it takes to get to this. Some people can get through it in 10 minutes. Some people take, you know, two hours. But if you take the time to go through and organize these, to complete this task because I don't want to overwhelm them with describing it yet, then I guarantee you, you're going to have a shift in the way that you spend your time and the way that you spend your energy and you will think about it differently forever from this point on. But when you think about it differently, it's going to be so clear in your mind about how you can do differently. when you, here's the thing, if you want to be different, you have to do something different. But if you want that different to be good and strategic, then the difference that you do has to be good and strategic. And I'm going to tell you, without knowing your business, without being over your shoulder, I'm going to show you how you can custom tailor, not according to what I I think is important, but what is important to you, your activities so that you get more from less of your time and so that you have more energy and more peace while you're doing your activities, your work activities, business, whatever. I'll improve that script a little bit, but basically that's it and then send them through the exercise and then have a closing one. Like, okay, this is not, so first of all, I want you to pause for a minute and I want you to ponder and reflect on what did you experience? What was your aha moment? I would like you to write down your ahas. What were your epiphanies? did you notice that maybe you didn't notice before? What did you notice about how you should not be spending your time or how you should be spending your time? What did you notice about energy and what could be altered and improved? Now what we're gonna do is go through and apply this. I want you to do, sort your activities according to, you know, what we just did, and then I want you to spend the next 30 days operating with this new awareness. But what I want you to do again in 30 days, and maybe you're not an overachiever and maybe you want to do it in 90 days, but you want to come back to this activity soon, and what you want to do is the same activity. You want to take stock again of where your time is going, how it's impacting your energy, how it's impacting your profits, because now they've had it all explained to them that it's energy profits, time, all this stuff that they're looking at. And ask yourself, because now you're a new person, you're a new person tomorrow, you're a new person 30 days from now, you're a new person 90 days from now, and I want you to go back through this activity and go, is there something else I'm not paying attention to that I'm not aware of? And what I can promise you is that you will have changed, you will have a new epiphany So if you continue to do this, this is called an iteration, we make a new change, we make a new improvement, and if you continually do that, and maybe it's not every 30 days, maybe sometimes it's every three months, and maybe one day it's six months later, and maybe life got crazy and it's a year later. But thing about this is that I'm going to teach you timeless principles. You can go back and apply anything I'll ever teach you, and every time you apply it, you will have an improvement, because you will have changed in your awareness and understanding will have increased, and so your ability to apply the timeless principle will improve the results. So it doesn't matter, if you're really consistent about doing it, if you're more consistent, you get better results, but every time you do it, you will get good results.
00:18:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, so, so Breaking that out. I I started taking notes here. So so video ones about leverage video to energy and priorities to shift To shift you away like how you spend time how you think about your time And you're gonna kind of have them do exercises in that video too during video too By the way, like it everything you just said first of all Overall summary, but I went into like okay.
00:19:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's let's create this mode. Okay mechanical mode.
00:19:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
get it. I'm good Yeah, yeah. so so yeah, like just real quick Rather than just drawing. I just want to start this little document. So Energy and and here you'll you'll do also talk about yourself and success stories, right? Okay our results So energy and priorities shift away, okay, so and then come back in three days since activity repeat Take stock where time is going how it's impacting your problems. It's all this in video too and the exercises.
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I didn't break these up. What we could do is I could just make whatever comes out and then we cut it if cutting is needed. But what I was imagining is the leverage energy and priorities is all in the welcome video because all of that is a preface to what we're about to do.
00:20:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And it's very short. I cover it in less than five minutes.
00:20:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it could be broken into chapters or it could be broken into short of videos. But I really do think it needs to be a contained thing because this is the before you start you need to have this. It's a micro lesson.
00:20:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Five minutes is still very short.
00:20:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it is a timeless lesson in and of itself. Leverage, energy priorities, and learning how to maximize those and also the concept of persistence and consistency. which are not the same thing. Persistence is how energetically you're at it, right? drive for it. Consistence is frequency. they're both separate elements, but if they're both present, those are productivity amplifiers and magnifiers and multipliers. So that's what makes it leveraged also when there's persistence behind it.
00:21:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Persistence is a leverage.
00:21:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Consistency is a lever. So, but these are not, this is not how people are thinking. Most people don't think this way, which is why when I get the new clients I've been getting are attorneys and doctors and they're paying me a thousand dollars an hour and their minds are blown. And so like I, in my point, is not anything. It's just that these are some of them are Ivy League and They're still not thinking like this. My point is that this is not, people aren't trained this way, but once they have the understanding, these are not difficult concepts and these people are not too stupid to understand this. It is, it's just not taught and given. And so anyway, anybody could apply it to any type of business, any type of activity, any type of stewardship and they will be better, they could be a soccer coach and this would help them. This would help them. You know what I mean? Like any stewardship that you have, leaders said, this is how I think I'm going to be arrogant, but I'm probably arrogant.
00:22:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, I'm sure it would help a lot. I guess the thing I'm thinking in my mind is just, yeah, let's get the training done and out there and start having people go through it to get the more testimonials and stuff for it.
00:22:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, it's just sitting down and getting it done, but I need to just sit down and get it done. Today. It'd be a good day. I just I need to do day. You like just give me do they say Tina? need you to have X done by X and be aggressive about it because I could do it. I need I need accountability. need help. Please.
00:23:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:23:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:23:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So so two questions. Yeah, we can give you deadline is and the first question is is in one week good enough like by Tuesday next week.
00:23:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yeah.
00:23:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because it should take a total of like four hours or less. Like it could be one hour. But I know myself sometimes it condense 60 minutes of concepts into a five minute video more valuable than just blabbing away for 60 minutes.
00:23:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I don't mean think it'll be an hour.
00:23:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I already have a video for this. Actually, I just want to make it for it's way better now. So it's all years ago and it was like 20 minutes. So let's have a deadline of a week from Tuesday. Yep. Oh, Friday. Okay.
00:23:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Friday. Awesome.
00:23:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I could have it done by tomorrow.
00:23:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. But I won't push myself.
00:24:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like I have What's today Tuesday? Yeah, yeah, and the second question is for you to get this done will be better, would it be better for us to just do a working session where I go. Okay, go create video one right now and let's come back in half an hour. Okay, let's do that. So, so, yeah, go create video one right now and then let's reconvene right now.
00:24:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's Well, normally that would be good today because of the work situation.
00:24:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Gotcha.
00:24:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. But but we could say, you know, create first draft today. Let's have a working session tomorrow. Like we can even wrap it up if you want to because I don't want to monopolize your time. I paid for a certain amount and I don't want to use that. Yeah.
00:24:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What? Go ahead. Tomorrow's wide open after 12 noon my time.
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, I didn't get around, yeah, my brain, Maria, oh, so I'm taking my daughter to girls camp tomorrow. That's early in the morning. And, um, the heck is that? Oh, so I found a co-working thing yesterday, actually. Oh, cool. And, um, it's called flow dock club, I think.
00:25:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:25:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to try doing something like that.
00:25:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
totally forgot about it already.
00:25:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But, um, flow dot club, I'll go to the website. Yeah, go look at that.
00:25:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Right. We're going to get your work done. Go get focused free. Oh, that's cool.
00:25:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It seems like different people create their own sessions and their types of sessions. that they want. So this one that I chose, it's called 120 minutes, finished strong flow club with Lex, and she's like a law student or something. And so they have five minutes of briefly sharing goals with the group, 50 minutes of doing solo focus work on mute, five minutes celebrating at the end. And I was like, that's perfect.
00:26:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's amazing. This is amazing.
00:26:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:26:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, I really need that.
00:26:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So.
00:26:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Wow.
00:26:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:26:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Right. Yeah, I like it.
00:26:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but then I meant if it was today, that'd be even better. I don't know how they're, how long they're gonna be working on this because even though, but I imagine it's gonna be a while and that's just a major brain disruptor.
00:26:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, no, I get it. I get it.
00:26:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like if I have my cleaner here and sometimes just ask me questions. Oh, I know. Yeah. Oh, you're going to hair appointment is white going with you. Are they still working? I'll pay you all. I love you. Bye. Have fun. I love her hair done. Okay, so hasn't told me what time she wants to be for girls camp tomorrow and it's 45 minutes away. So I really Don't know what my availability is until I know at least she'll be there by 10.
00:27:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I at least we'll be back by 11 My time so noon my time is to wake up. Wait, what time did you say you're available? Yeah, like after 12 noon Um, nine a.m. So If you're available after 12 noon, your time that's three o'clock, my time that works. I go up till about five o'clock. And then Thursday, Thursday after 2.30 PM, after 11.30 AM your time.
00:28:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I have a call with Dan from 12 to 1 on Thursdays, but then I'm done after that. So if you have that time block tomorrow at noon, and I hate to ask for a tentative time, but I'm okay if you can't do it. But if we're just reviewing what there is and then, because honestly, if I finished it, I'll just send it to you and say, here's what we thought. And so it doesn't necessarily have to be a fixed time. We can just do kind of a back and forth for the most part. And then if... I can experiment with that flow session and see if that's helpful, but basically what I need for me. Okay, so your offer super , by the way, was, you know, it takes you 18 or whatever, 180 hours. I don't remember to come up. was a structure and a format of things that need to get and things that you would extract and then this is what we've got out. So the bullet point of even that mental focus of, okay, these are the things that we need to have. So you go, you know, Tina, you go create this and then you're telling me if you tell me what you're doing, that will help me just go, okay, these are my containers.
00:29:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I need to go fill them up.
00:29:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And is there, I don't even like, if I could look at the sales page, I'd go back and look at that. Epic, could you help me figure out what the structure is and what, what all I want to need to do and like, how do we get to the finished product? So I know if I create it, the, I create the training, um, then there's, there's copy and there's all these other things. What parts do you do? What parts are we doing together?
00:30:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:30:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
been a thing.
00:30:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So basically, um, I'll, and you're kind of a rare breach that you're going to So like, I kind of do the copy and, but you know, you, like, you might have something that's like stellar to write instead or add to it, et cetera. Um, less is more in these little $3 things. keep in mind it's really just a headline bullet points stuff. And then, um, I will like, uh, help put together basically, like once you have the training done, like I can kind of just take a look at it and. Just, it's more just review what you've done, like, like, again, you're kind of every that you're very experienced all this. So it's more like, is there a worksheet or success action that needs to be better or added to it to make sure there's consumption, right? my biggest thing about this is like, how many people are really going to use it? So there's that. And as far as getting it done, yeah, like I'll do the sales page and even the technical set up of it and the reality is, again, then what's the order bump going to be? So I help strategize like what the offer portfolio is. So what the order bump should be and then what is the what's after they buy the $3 thing, whether or not they buy the order bump or not, they land on either a thanks page or like upsell one page. So typically what's not in scope, obviously, is crafting up to the one upsell too for you. But typically what a lot of people do, and I even suggest that even for the, like, product boss who've made a million dollars with their $37 offer, right, is they first started with just the front end thing, and then it wasn't up. So one was just a thank you page for the first month. And then after that, they added. So what you could do on the thinking page, like we just need to figure out what what you want to send them into. So it could be, you know, book a call and into, you know, your private coaching, it could be, you know, just for now, love how creating hybrid coaching, like, I don't know what it looks like, and how much of your time I can buy, and how much of your help I could have that being able to stay focused and basically getting through the offer creation.
00:32:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If I can implement this co-working so I've got, you know, something to help me do my stuff where I don't need your high level brain. But I tend to overthink offers, and copy. I do know less is more, but I also know that long copy does a really good job when somebody needs more time to be convinced so I go through a gamut of logic and I just go like that. But I also know that done is better than perfect and perfect isn't real. But because I get stuck in my head having somebody just go, well, this works. Let's try this. You know, this is what I do with my people.
00:33:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, let's just try it. Like, you don't know. Yeah, that's kind of what that is. Just try it. That's kind of what this is because like, what I, to be honest, what I kind of foresee for you for just a cadence, I really feel this is that it'd be cool because you're also your energy so amazing live and zoom and stuff. It'd be cool if like, end result, six months from now, what's the cadence look like? That, And also from the customer journey point of view is that they come in and two ways to get access to you from cold, right? Is either buying the $3 thing and remember you're still building your list because the way the $3 thing is they opt in, right? For it before they buy so they're gonna have lot of abandoned carts Which is still on your list and that person might buy something else for me And and then you have once a month like a mid ticket like a hundred dollar maybe live workshop once a month. That's it So you're starting to build an offer portfolio from that because if the workshop is slightly different every month not the same one Those things can become you're up. So one you're up cell to see how we're kind of the case But also I'm riding on something else here. That's interesting We're in a weird and year into this also because your your love of psychology and everything and trends Um 2024 and 2025 26 we're in a weird movement moving forward because with AI and everything. Yeah, content online is a commodity like anybody like you know a 16 year old kid could pretend to be a 45 year old and say I made a million dollars and put up a bunch of content and you know whatever do okay so I think we're shifting to A that's why I like the $3 thing people want some immediate thing for cheap right to get to know you yeah low-risk yeah and they get a taste of your stuff but be also some live access to you because authenticity sells right so so in that live access you know is engineered like I'll get to the group coaching session for second but but if it's once a month like this workshop you don't have to do this for the rest of your life you actually building up all these other little products that can be sold and then also the workshops can be recorded and chair won't go up sorry and so that becomes part of the concert That library anyway, my brain will exactly exactly. And then if you're going to this, this is actually, I'm actually re visualizing my own micro offer kind of business to is is and I like this concept is that then you go to the hybrid coaching that's way more high ticket, like maybe it's a hundred bucks a week or 250 a week with you and you're only doing in your game for this to, you know, live coaching a month. But they get access to you. We can figure out what the pricing is and stuff, but because I know you're really good at that, like, because that really resonated with me last week about the value, right? so discounting. But you know, you could have some more high end kind of group container coaching that is not like open, close, open, close.
00:36:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's more like it's there.
00:36:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I don't like that game and also can't talk about consistency.
00:36:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, do that. So it's out of alignment. with my other principles to do.
00:37:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. so the monthly workshops can also be built based on kind of the feedback you're getting from people. Like you could have a beta, beta founders join my, you know, XYZ program, you know, Go ahead.
00:37:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was just going to say what I like about it being so low ticket filling it up is that what what is really difficult for me is low energy. So, so like when I show up to alive and I've done group training and there's hardly anybody there and everyone's quiet, it drives me nuts. I can talk to myself. I want to. I don't enjoy just hearing the sound of my voice that you wouldn't know because I don't shut up. But this energy, it's because of you. Like, because you're here and not just because a person is here, but a person with an amazing mind and personality and values, I'm feeding off of that. So if there's nobody in there or there's a couple of people or their weak energy, like I really want to be able to fill up a room.
00:38:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:38:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Again, back to I draw energy from kids that are here, and I'm not even with them. Like I'm very sensitive to energy. But also, as you've experienced, I can project it, which is why I'm never afraid of AI because no type of AI has spiritual soulful energy. And I do know that my translates through text even.
00:38:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know how.
00:38:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know why, but I know that when people read my words, even just the words change them. Pure text, no images. So, you know, like I'm excited for that, but I also have to keep it in the energy container of, I can't build a framework that requires too much of my time. I need to leverage my time so that yeah, whatever access people get to me. Um, what I wanted to be is an environment where the energy is there for them to top into because even if they are aware that they're feeling the energy and being benefited by the energy, they're still being benefited by it. They don't have to. They just need to feel it and that they're getting so, so one of the things that I've learned is that where most people just kind of throw a grenade at a business or they just make you want to overhaul everything, I'm taking surgical cuts, that's what the leverage is. So anyway, but I really want to be able to find a way to work with you long term. I don't think I need a lot of your time and maybe because we were talking about the CEO of the Spicy Brain CEO being separate, but and I would love to serve you if there would be a way that you would like to use my brain, I would be happy to just share it. Find like I'm not opposed to paying obviously. Yeah. Yeah, not what I mean, but whatever it is Maria I really I want to spend more time doing this together. I would love to support you So to separate I have a habit of converging things and this needs to have its container But anyway, I get excited when you talk about it and those offers that makes logical sense to me And I'm excited because this is what I need Cool. Yeah, so so no, it's cool So yeah, and I definitely think that too because I think you could help me a lot on focusing and in your time management stuff and just You know, yeah, so so now so really what we're talking about is sort of like you're just selling Different levels of access to yourself right like is the three-dollar thing You know is like there's just your training right in the worksheets, you know, but I do have more training So just just because my work on Yeah semantics of it and logistics of it like there is definitely more training to be had that doesn't need to have access. Yeah, because I think that I can train it in video very well. And I think that my energy and my experience have been that even in video and it doesn't have to be live, the energy is still contagious. Yeah, infectious, you know, and so I do think that they're on the spectrum are more levels of it's not access to me per se, but just to the training and that there's always an upsell of access with whatever level of training they're getting. yeah. But there's definitely more modular type stuff that we can sell and package and put together. And if I do these co-working sessions, I can hammer them out because I can do the stuff in my sleep. Yeah, have the energy, just the energy. Yeah, anyway, so that help kind of Yes, we're selling access to me. Yes, there's a spectrum of it and the price point, but we also can sell just the information and the training. That's a lot of words to insert that. Sorry.
00:42:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, no, I got it. That's good. good. um, yeah. So I think, I think, yeah, first up, let's just get the training part done, the $3 thing done. um, you said, your clients just get out there.
00:42:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I'll get it out there. Okay.
00:42:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And just, so, and just close things off. um, when are we, it's kind of potentially tomorrow, right? And you're just going to text me.
00:42:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what, how about we do this because I, I don't, um, can we schedule it for Thursday or even, um, Friday? And do just email communication back and forth, because I think if I create something, we don't need to be on a call for you to say, you know, you need to go create this, like, I just need you to be able to review it. And then to me calls are for brainstorming, clarity, you know, things that can't be done through email or vox or even I love the audio messages, because I don't like I love talking to you. I love that. If I if I can just get the stuff done, I'd rather have your time for riffing, you know, that type of thing that can't be accomplished the other way.
00:43:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I agree.
00:43:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I agree. Okay. how about we don't even schedule anything yet. I'll get my work done. And then the only way to get access to your time is to get my work done.
00:43:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yep. And Friday's your deadline. Okay. All right.
00:43:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cool. Love it.
00:43:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Thanks. All right.
