No. No, they had a baby and I went and stayed with them for a week and Took me skiing, which I didn't know how to do and it was all ice So yeah, I made a I mean one run where I didn't fall Yeah, it's not as easy as it looks Now there is this business where do you own but you're kind of killing it right now Yeah, um I'm really like accepting or accepting is that the worry. Yeah, excepting we'll go with it like Getting comfortable with the idea of like Like what I like I'm good at writing. I Can I can go in to? know a legit business and I can make an impact with What I do with copywriting and I was just thinking like I always had this mentality growing up of like you know, go get a job, go work. And I was like, working is just what I know how to do. And so I, you know, I'm looking at the stuff I'm doing with Tim and the Jim and getting five grand there. And then I've got another potential client in the, that I mentioned in the conservative political space that I think it'd be a lot of fun to work with. And they're interested in meeting with me. I know them really well through Brian. So, you know, I have no idea what that budget is, but whatever if it's not them, I feel like, well, somebody else I could find to do another five grand a month. And I was just thinking like, you know, I kind of like just going in, having a really defined scope of what I'm doing, focusing on that, and getting paid, you know, feels like a really attainable at least for now, like, putting together, like, like being the face of a product, or putting something out there that I'm, that I'm selling, for, at this point, in my life, like, I feel, I feel really just comfortable selling other other people's stuff for them, like, I'll admit, like, I probably have a, a block on selling. My own stuff, especially if I'm the face of it, and I'm open to moving past that, but at the same time it's like this other skill set of just doing copywriting for people can make me get money and I enjoy it. And yeah, the idea that I was thinking, the term was like, I know how to work like a blue collar person, and you know, because that's what I grew up around, and I was like, what if I just start taking more of that mentality, like an elevated blue collar type of approach where I go and I'm a workhorse, I can still set my hours, I work, you know, five or six hours a day, and it's a manageable schedule, I still set my own hours, and So, yeah, I'm just kind of like, that feels like in the strike zone for me, um, no.
00:06:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have a hard stop at 1230 or whatever time it is for you to 30?
00:06:16 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
No, it's, no, it's 142 for me. I've got to take my dogs to the groomers at three. So, I've got, I've got like an hour. Okay.
00:06:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just want to make sure that we can go through everything, but I just want to maybe think about the language a little bit because all, all words have connotations to them. Yeah. One with blue collar is kind of grunt worker and low value. Yeah. It depends on who you're talking to, right? Amongst the blue collar people, they're like, you know, I'm innocent to work early. you know, and anybody that pays attention to the economy knows that there's a shortage of laborers, skilled laborers. But you're, so there's a couple of things to it. One is that you just, you get things done. So what I would say, and again, there's so many parallels with us in how you serve and how I serve. What I've been called, I think before I even called myself that, then it was Ryan Maran pointed it out, and it's driving. I'm a driver. get things done. I can be driving myself, driving the project, but it's the energy and the momentum behind that word, but it connotation to it.
00:07:56 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Do you know what I mean?
00:07:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. The other thing that, And I think that this is something we could probably start to help you put some meat on and create a framework, which is something I never really did well because I really kind of custom tailored around people. But now that I've been doing it for so long, I realize that there is a plan, there is a strategy like semi modules. For example, to give you is I've got principles and priorities, know, I have to go even look them up. That's how I know what they are and we go through them, but thinking about them chronologically. So principles and priorities, and then it goes into finances, and then it goes to time tracking, and then we go into project management, and then we go into teams. And then we go into hiring teams, and then it's sharp in your saw and kind of mindset and things like that. And then it's iterative, constantly, right? But the reason we kind of start there is because principles informally, priority, priority informs what gets done. And the reason we go to our finances next is because finances let you know what you need to be gunning for, what you can do, what you can't do. Then we get into time because money had to dictate what our resources are before we even think about how we spend our time. But also priorities had to be dictated before we could even think about our times, you know what I mean? So then we get into project management. Okay, now we know what's important to us, we know what we can afford, we know what we need to set as a target so that we can get to the team that we want to work on. And now we know where we're going to spend our time, let's structure it, let's get it into a project management suite. Okay, now that we've got that, who are we hiring, what's our dream team? And it could just be one person that we're starting anyway, but I do kind of have a systematic approach now. Not everybody is at the same place in that conversation has nuance of. looks a little different but really it's not and the reason that it looks different is because of values and priorities and things like that so budgets you know and things like working in front of the screen working behind the scene kind of thing you know things like what's your conversion right right how many eyeballs you're getting on your offer what is your offer how big is your audience list how many offers have you even made to them how long have they been sitting there not getting an offer um you know did you did you just give them one offer and it was way up here did you try down here did you ascend them like there's a whole lot of things that can happen kind of chronologically and so you go through that going oh you missed this spot let's come back here you missed this you know what i mean or you did this but it was we don't have clear data we have data but it wasn't well or you made this change since the last time you did this this. So systematically approaching all the things that you know how to do. Now, if you built that into a written down framework of these are all the things that I'm going to look at because you just do it automatically.
00:11:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's in your head.
00:11:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do the same things. But I haven't really up until now, which is what I'm working on. sat there and documented these are all the levers I'm always looking for in the business.
00:11:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I've been doing it in my head.
00:11:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many times that I tell you, Chris, get it out of your head. You need the document in it. So taking my own advice. But that's where your power is. So back to kind of blue collar.
00:11:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's not blue collar work.
00:11:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's power. And one of the other types of descriptions I've given is I'm a surgeon. I make surgical because I'm not going in there and like, you know, blowing everything up or I'm not pumping you full of drugs that are systemic, right? I'm going to the pain points. We are only going to fix the pain point. We're going to make the least. of damage to the body possible, right? So, and that's where, what is the word? Freedom and cash fastest path, the tip of the time, okay? Fastest path to cash and fastest path to freedom, where they intersect is where we make the most of money in the least amount of time, that's a precision cut. So, you kind of do the same thing because offers our precision cuts.
00:12:26 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:12:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We are not changing your whole business. We're not overhauling the website that you're on. We're not overhauling your tech stack. We're not overhauling your team. We're not overhauling the products that you've created. We're taking everything that you have as existing assets, if possible, and improving the offers made with the existing assets or looking for how can we repurpose the asset into, switch it, or what's a supplementary or complement. entry offer that you can make. From everything that you've ever done with Brian and everything I've seen you do for yourself and other people, those are the precision cuts that you make. So that offers, what I would love to do is just kind of go through your paragraphs section by section and kind of try to do that for you, right? Precision cuts, what can we do to improve that? I would like to talk mostly about your opportunities to make sure that because one thing I think that you can still have help with is you're an offer king except for when it comes to making your own offer as a consultant. What I would like you to do is pretend you are somebody else, okay? So you're not pitching yourself. No, like write it down and you can give him an avatar or something else if you need to mentally disconnect so that you don't. getting that ego thing. Yeah, like, I know everything about this guy. This is what he does. This is what he brings to the table. This is this business. This is how this guy is gonna just help it. And this is what it's worth. And now you're gonna make that pitch on behalf of him, which is you, right? be like, this, this is a no brainer. So if you don't have a brain and you don't So you go and look at the odds that I'm going to be able to get you a 5% lift. If I do this and you support me doing this, I mean, the odds are very small that that fails. You know, if you want to give a guarantee, you don't or in the guarantee could be, I'll say until I get that lift provided, you show up, you provide whatever you're supposed to provide that how confident I am. so I'm not going to give you a money back guarantee because that's my time. But I'll commit my time until we win because I see your stuff is that good, so I'm I'm believing in you and I'm not just asking you to believe in me, but that's how much I'm believing in your stuff is that I'll commit my time guaranteed until we get X results, right, right.
00:15:17 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
People are going to know that most people won't. Yeah, that that's a interesting mental exercise to create a software for for somebody else because I I was reading about people are doing these they call it they call it product highest services basically like design joy is the one who who really the first place I came across it is just a designer that that sells his design services for flat flat fees got a very like clear process before you buy, how it works, like, you know, I'm going to work on one thing for you at time. So that it's not like stacking up, like this is how we're going to work together type of thing. And it's like, you know, I think he's five grand a month. And then and then there are a got a list of other companies that are doing this similar model of productizing their services. I've got some copywriters who are doing that as well. And I was thinking about that around because the thing that I'm I think the thing that I'm best at is email copy. I do long form. I mean, I've written two sales letters for 10, like in really short, short order, one of them. did really well. other one, the offer wasn't as good. He's gonna end up doing a little over 10 grand on that one. But the first one, you know, he did 75 grand and that was a much stronger offer. And so yeah, I'm following what you're saying and I'm thinking about like a way to sell consulting services because I mean really like what I what I really want is to be at place where I'm investing the money that that comes in into cash flowing investments that that pay me you know eventually we'll be able to replace the income that I want to make. make. that's always been sort of what I've had in my mind of like, this is what I want to do. And the way that I've always tried to go about doing that is by trying to put myself in the role of, you know, a specific way to do business, like launching and releasing products. And which, you know, is not out of the realm of possibility for me, but just like right now in the near term, I'm, you know, Brian talks about, like, you got to follow the anecdotal evidence. And right now, the anecdotal evidence is, you know, doing these consulting gigs is bringing in cash. And so it's just got my mind thinking that maybe I need to rethink that whole The whole idea of consulting, whereas for so long, I've seen it as a time for money treadmill. But if I think in terms of a decade, like 10 years, if I were to do this for 10 years, I'm you know, after 10 years, like that's, how old is Grady? Grady's 13.
00:19:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How? How's he that old?
00:19:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:19:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's an eighth grade. Oh my gosh.
00:19:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
This year.
00:19:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, something just along those lines of what you're thinking about, and obviously everybody's different, but I find that my resistance to being out in front is shifting now that I'm getting
00:20:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
getting near the emptying nesting.
00:20:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I wonder how much of that was self-preservation was also family protection. There's a different amount of pressure, and also there's such a thing as internet famous. mean, going into a marketing conference and being recognized, that was a very long time. That was 11 years ago, 12 years ago. And I was barely online. And now, you know, the world is much smaller, and we get there faster with TikTok and YouTube. if you're going to create new content, it's going to go everywhere. So if you're a face, you're a face. And that brings a whole new level of theme that I think naturally, protectively, we don't want our families to deal with. And it does take focus away because we feel. extra level of responsibility to our fans, our audience, our customers, whatever. And they feel an entitlement to the people that they engage with like, where are you? What's going on? Like, that's a whole nother of emotional estimate that I think maybe we don't consciously think about as much as we subconsciously go. You have no, no, no needed, don't want it. And I think that we have both kind of observed that there tends to be a little bit of an ego thing that goes on with a lot of people that are faces that maybe we're trying to protect ourselves against not wanting to be that person. And that, but that has a correlation to the same thing with money. Like, when you don't have money, you tell yourself that having money is bad. And that you don't want to do it because you'll be bad. but money doesn't change people. just amplifies what they are and they get, you know, they reveal it faster. So, Anyway, the thing about the 10 years thing, Grady will be grown, Madeleine will be grown, and into college, that's a whole exit runway there, giving you guys time to, because of course you could always shorten that if you wanted to, with that plan, you're now getting them set up in new houses, going to college, that stuff's expensive, and they in a different kind of way, like really being physically present when they're little, you know, they can go off and play for a little while, but now they're like, they know if you're paying attention to them, they know if you're really invested and available and all that stuff. So anyway, here's what I love about that plan for you. That's what I love about it, but the other thing is, it comes down to the boundaries, which is the conversation we've been having a lot, right? So you used to have a habit, which I think that you're very much getting out of, which is... If I'm here, I have to take care of everything because if I see a problem, I got to fix the problem and If I see the problem I'm accountable for the problem and it should probably come out of my own pocket And because I'm a partner or you know what I mean?
00:23:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Like you took a lot of things on you that didn't belong on you.
00:23:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, sure Yes, but not just Brian. It happened in it with the lease stuff. Um, I think it happened with I want to say Tim It it one of your first consulting jobs.
00:23:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom.
00:23:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, um, yeah because I I You are prone to feel a sense of obligation to something that isn't yours and I think partly out of fear of Maybe just just because you saw it. Maybe it's just because you saw it. So you feel accountable for it Side to comprehend the value and know that you're there to help. And so I think I'm the one that has to help with everything. Anyway, I think that that's what really bogged you down the most is because you can't do all of that. You were getting paid to do all of that. And now because you've created two things, really powerful things that I don't think really existed for you before, like when we first met with Brian and anything since, until around this year, last, last whole year, not just calendar year, and that is boundaries and leverage. So a very more defined scope of support that you both expressed and kept to that that's the important part kept to you. And then the leverage was in that scope of support that also it was that I'm doing this thing specifically. That's all I'm doing. This is the power of it. this is the value of it, this is what it's supposed to bring to the table for you, for me, that like you and the business and your partners. And so, as long as you not only keep doing that but improve that, if you continue to optimize that, your capacity to consult and have an impact and continue to be paid, the other factor is that lever is only as powerful as the way it can lift and the reward it can bring. So, if the person you're working for right now that you did those sales letters, the gym, I can't think of this, that's Tim. And Tom 10, that's how I get it. impact was able to be made because of his resources, because of his instruction. So you were able to plug into something powerful. So that's the other thing is, If you're going to try to help somebody that has almost nothing as a business, it doesn't matter how powerful your step is, they don't have powerful stuff to plug into, know, a 2% increase to $200, 2% increase to $2 million is, you know what I mean? So if you take all of those things into account when you are making those offers, you know, the leverage power, the reward, and also the risk for the drain and everything, that gets mitigated and the reward gets maximized. Yeah, probably all the things you're already thinking about, but I just want to add the support to it and say yes to it.
00:26:43 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I mean, I think like I'm comfortable now with like the idea of like my minimum is, you know, at least 5 grand a month, so that, and I get there, there are a lot of ways to get But for me, I get there just mentally of like, I'm involved in, you know, a couple other things. so if I'm going to take my time to focus on something else, like it's got to be paying me this amount of money. And, and that'll serve as a, that'll serve as a nice filter for people too. But, yeah, I mean, I think, I think adding another consulting client in the other, the other unknown is with this, this tea thing. I spoke to, to Jim yesterday, and he owes me, I'll say he owes me an update by tomorrow. Apparently, the issue there is like, there's, They've got this Microsoft server that their pages are built on and the pages are not loading because of some server area, server error, so they've got this IT guy that they work with. So he's like, I'm going to get these pages up and loading this week and then I'm going to move everything over to Linux server, he's like I'm done with Microsoft. So I mean, it's a technical issue that I like that's more technical than I know what to do with when you're talking about server performance and issues.
00:28:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you said Microsoft server and I was like, what are pages, you've heard said pages, but now I'm thinking more like Windows NT or something like that. Anyway, totally irrelevant.
00:29:03 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Definitely out of Got it. Yeah. and that's, so I don't fully understand the issue, but I believe Jim, like I don't get the sense that, like he's, I don't get the sense like there's anything nefarious going on here, and it's not like they have any leverage to do anything anyway, but.
00:29:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What, now what does he do?
00:29:42 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
What's his business? So, Jim is John's son and.
00:29:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, oh, this, these are the tea. These are the tea.
00:29:53 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay. Okay.
00:29:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's something else in his business is having issues. Like, how does it, does this affect you or just says something keeping him busy?
00:30:05 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, it affects me in the sense of like these, these pages, these sales pages that John wrote. And I'm more or less copy chief, but John wrote the upsell pages. Because of whatever server issue is happening, like they're not, they're not loading. Um, so they're hosting? It, they keep using the word server. Um, it's, it sounds like, it sounds like a hosting issue.
00:30:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, okay, but, um, originally you had the T domain, you had all of that stack. Oh, well now it's on click bank, right? So can you give me the tech stack real quick? Just kind of like where it was before, where it is now, what changed?
00:30:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Um, the offer will be on click bank. So, clipping handles the payment processing, but the actual pages are your pages that you host on your own.
00:31:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you used to host your own staff, so he took over all of that now?
00:31:21 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, they, so they're not using any of the hosting that I had on the, for the tea before, because the way that we're selling the tea is, is with an existing offer that they have on, on click bank, and it's, it's called a new, new body, it's a, it's like a health and wellness fitness offer for people, loose fat, build muscle like anything, because that's John's back. ground. And so the upsell for the T is going to be shown to those buyers initially to solve the traffic issue of not having to go out and build an ad campaign to start so we can get cash flowing in that then we can reinvest back into coal traffic and that type of thing. So the click bank is handling the payment processing and then I guess the pages, the pages are not loading or they're not floating quickly enough for whatever technical reason is going on with this, they keep using the word Microsoft server. So maybe it's a server inside their hosting. I don't know what they're using.
00:33:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, or the other way around hosting on a server because every site that we have is on a server somewhere.
00:33:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right, right. So. Okay, then the. So those are the main two pieces attack the clipping payment processing in their hosting slash server that are in place and there's an issue with the hosting server. then after after the purchase happens, we're using ship station to handle the fulfillment. to, uh, to the folks up in, in Rochester.
00:34:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, just to adjust an upsell to their stuff. Mm hmm. Okay.
00:34:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. I'm click bank and they, and they have, um, you know, five to 7,000 people come through that funnel every month. So it's a, it's a good. Um, you know, it's not a huge, but it's a decent stream of traffic to put this offer in front of, and, uh, for the purposes of testing and acquiring customers, you know.
00:34:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, it depends on how much you want to be involved in, and what you want to know because your bottlenecked by this. It's not your primary business. Um, I were going to be involved at all, I would want I know, where is it hosted? Why are you using, like, is this a personal server? Is this, I mean, because there are, you know, mom and pop shop servers and hosting services. And, but you didn't specify that in a contract. And any of that type of stuff, and it behooves them to get their stuff figured out, but maybe just asking questions and making sure they're not operating in dinosaur ways, they've got optimized. And having a, you know, not a, I'm demanding things, but let's have a talk and see if you can do some better things, choose a better hosting provider, whatever, I don't know. But yeah, I mean, server issues are real, especially when you're not using a streamlined one that has a huge team that has lots of different servers that you can go to.
00:35:58 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Well, I mean, I spoke to him yesterday, spoke to Jim yesterday and, you know, I mean, I could tell he's in it like he sounded just like just done with the whole thing and ready to to move and get it fixed. he he promised me an update by Thursday, by tomorrow, and I'll I'll text him if I don't want hear from him. You know, I I just have been, I've kind of given a longer leash to them, I guess.
00:36:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
pacing comes in because there's just something you can't predict. and there was a big learning curve and then it's that's where priority comes into because if this isn't your bread and butter yeah but you got this existing asset and your priority was don't lose the asset but don't be buried by it don't have to do the marketing basically you tap into my existing resources and I get paid there's no reason not to let it take a pace that is chill as long as you can tell it's being moved along stuff is getting done maybe it's not the way you would have wanted to but 80-20 is you're barely touching it it should still end up paying you you just have to get set up but the advising you know I don't know how old they are but if you're dealing with a man and his grown son it's been around for a while probably little bit up there um yeah yeah and also I think yeah John's in his 60s and Jim is like early
00:38:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
really for you. So he's, he's around my age and, you know, they, uh, Jim is like his, um, his operations person basically. So he works with his dad on his office. Hey, who's dad?
00:38:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who's son?
00:38:21 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Uh, John, John is the dad.
00:38:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Jim is the son.
00:38:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, it's definitely moving, uh, slower than I expected, but I also, I do, I do feel like it's going to get solved here real soon. Like I talked to him yesterday about, you know, I'd really like to get this off for a live next month. Uh, do you have to knew anything? Is, well, I, I purchased, um, bunch of tea for inventory. So, you know, that's a cost I've already made and invested in, and I brought that up like 10 days ago to them when reached out, like, let's get a timeline, like, I've done so much I've invested, and that really got their attention and a lot of apologies and that kind of thing.
00:39:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are costs split, do they have to pay for half of that also?
00:39:37 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
They don't have any cash, so I took that on and I get, like, all the profit goes to pay me back off the top from the first sales.
00:39:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A couple more things real quick. Can you, so something to maybe think about is use this as an exclusive offer. Hey, we had some tech issues and we just bought inventory, so we got to move this stuff to make sure whatever. Use that because that's real. Tap into that, maybe offer a special discount, but maybe it's not really like it's the price is built into it. So it's framed that way. Maybe ask them to email offer a little bit more aggressively than they would.
00:40:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's a potential thing.
00:40:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or if that tea goes bad and it doesn't get used, it comes out of their cuts when the money does come. Just some things to think about.
00:40:45 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Yeah, mean, we we all went into like in when I agreed to. To make that investment in John was up front from the very beginning from the very first call of like. He doesn't have any money to put into this, and he's had some financial struggles. Well, that's another reason to double check on the server issue, because maybe he's cutting corners, he shouldn't be cutting and being foresighted about it. That's true.
00:41:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because especially with an older school guy, that's possible. So, you know, and that's kind of affect you, something to think about.
00:41:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, for sure.
00:41:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think it figured out there's a huge dynamic difference, though, between that and how you started with other people, especially an older gentleman, that, you know, the dynamic should be your ultimately the boss. And it started with, you know, I want this 33, no.
00:41:54 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I've got 50, they each have 25.
00:41:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's probably not really anything else to talk about that particular thing, right?
00:42:11 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I don't think so. It's just moving slowly and about connected with Jim tomorrow to get an update.
00:42:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll let you go. So with this guy working with the lead company in political conservative space, that, did we talk about that? Was that part of the, you were talking about a consulting job and making an offer? And was that what you were referencing?
00:42:45 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, this is, the company is American Target advertising. Been around for decades. Found a by guy named Richard Bigory who back in the. late 60s like he's an older dude and he is like he invented like a new category of political fundraising and that's back in the late 60s raising money for Nixon and people like that and and it's it's really kind of burst a lot of the way that political fundraising is is done today I know him through through Brian because he was in Brian's the mastermind and his right hand is a lady named Kathleen Patton who I know really well but they they recently hired a like a director of digital marketing or something like that and she her name's Marcy she's in she went through the over-delivered boot camp And that we just finished yesterday. And I just heard her mention on a call that they were gonna be hiring, looking to hire an email, a copywriter. So I just sent her an email. was like, hey, I heard you say this, are you looking for full time, time? She said, part time. So I just said, I just basically told her I'd love to put my hat in the ring, told her I knew all the people she knows. And also just shared like, I do personally feel compelled to, like I do want the Republicans to win in November. And I want to, I would love to make a contribution to that. And that's all genuine and legit. shared that with her. Cause that's stuff I usually don't share with anybody. Yeah. so in Kathleen and I have talked politics a whole lot, and so I center a whole bunch of writing samples of stuff that I've done, and they're going to reach out to schedule a call heard from her yesterday that they were going to be reviewing everything and getting it to me.
00:45:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a few things I want to point out. Think about, ask about whatever. Yeah. Number one, it's while, but we talked about the power of network and how feeding that and nurturing that brings things around when, whether it be political and having those types of allies, there's going to be a day where we're all going to have their band arms one way or another. First, we physically, whatever it's going to happen, who we know, and the the level of relationships we have when that happens for people, whether it's large scale or small community scale, something is inevitable. Some type of civil upheaval is gonna happen. So that's one thing. To just getting to have a contribution in the way things do, we have no right to complain about anything when we won't do what's in front of us, you know. So there's that, you having the agora experience, just having an awareness of how agora emails, how they market, things like that, and how that impacts politics, because there's definitely a lot of involving there, is useful and beneficial. one thing I would do is change the way you ask the question about it and frame it. And now I'll take you back to blue collar worker full time of hard time, irrelevant surgeon. What are the results that you want? What are the results that you're looking for? Now we're talking about value, but when you say full-time part-time, you're automatically putting yourself in an hourly type position, evaluating your value per hour. You don't want that ever. You want to be evaluated based on your results. So we have an existing email list, we bring about $x in sales, we're looking to make this list. This is how often we email. This is our attrition rate on the email list. Like get data, don't ask about full-time part-time, just ask about what is your current email situation.
00:47:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Can I ask you some questions first?
00:47:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'd love to have a conversation with you about this. Email is something that I have a proven truck record of and making a significant lift in sales. Bye. multiples, you know, speaking in language like that, which, you know, people, people can use and use and they do, but that's true for you. And as you dig into it and ask the numbers, you can get that. But start positioning yourself immediately. Start leveraging the words and the conversation that you use immediately. You are not the hourly worker, you are not the employee, you are not the grunt worker, you are always consultants and experts, even if you're doing the labor.
00:48:37 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I take that point. I think my, my counter to that would be that this is not like a, I mean, small company in the sense of like, it doesn't have thousands of employees, but I know it's been around for a long time. It's kind of a corporate mentality. quality. And I will showcase all the things that you're talking about on a call with them. And at the same time, I know that if I feel like if I led with that with them, that it would be skipping, I'm trying to get my foot in the door. So I know they're thinking in terms of full-time or part-time. They say we want a full-time person. would have, I would know that like, well that I can't commit to that because what they're thinking is I want somebody 40 hours a week. so knowing that they're just looking for a part-time freelancer, that's helpful because I know that and what I said is like I'd love to have a conversation with you about what you're looking for and see if I can help. So I'm just trying to get the conversation in that conversation. Once I get it, then, you know, I can shift their understanding of what this is and what the potential is by the questions I asked. I take your point like I see what you're saying.
00:50:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I see what you're saying with the foot and the door. I still think that you may be reframing it in terms of what kind of volume are you looking for? Because that answers your full-time part-time and maybe they don't know it, which in and of itself is a signal because even if it's a good cause, you only have so much energy and time bandwidth. So if it's a poorly managed business or if the arrangement is not leveraged, even if it's a good cause, you might be signing up for or more than you really want to give and can give at this time so that's just something to think about not so and this goes back to you and it's been a while i don't know actually if you and i have ever talked about it but good better best i'm familiar with the concepts so the thing is you have finite yeses if you say yes to good things that's good if you say yes to great things that's great but here's the deal if you fill up with good and great you don't or good better best good and better you don't have room for best so you know do you want the best and and here's the other thing is sometimes we get these things that put something on our radar that never was on our radar before and sometimes that's all we needed so maybe it's all right this isn't really what I've got the bandwidth for right now but now I know I want to put my skills towards helping the Republicans win or or you know what I'm just going to volunteer this or I will do this which isn't everything you want but here's what I'll do here's the price that I'll charge you and here's why I think it's a no-brainer and you could take it or leave it but still put it inside of your terms don't worry about foot in the door because either they're going to vibe with your energy and the mission and the fact that you're not taking advantage of them but that you're also compartmentalizing and going okay but this is this is what I can this is the limit to what I can bring today um but then just and the other the other part of the pitch is but once I get inside and see what you're doing what I'll offer for free is a consultation for optimization and and just what I
00:53:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
see about improvement.
00:53:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you can find where in the conversation to have that or not have that. But remember that even in these things, when you want to get in your foot in the door, remember your level of expertise, that's all. And that there's finite time and energy.
00:53:22 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, for sure. Yeah, I see that.
00:53:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But then go chase the right thing that serves that purpose if you want it because it is an election year. And you do have major skills. So anyway, okay. You still have time.
00:53:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay.
00:53:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would really love to know about the boot camp, how that went.
00:53:47 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know, this is over the boot camp. This the only second time we've done it. I don't love it. Yeah. And it went only at 30. people sign up. so I was emailing with Brian yesterday because he was like, on the next boot camp, I want to add more of his ads to the slides and things like that because they're just basic slides. our response to him was like, yeah, we can do that. But I think the bigger challenge is like figuring out how to sell this. So because we had 60 people sign up on the first one. And, you know, like, if I, if I'm not the target market for the real, real boot camp, like if I had bought that and gone through it, I wouldn't be happy because it's, I mean, it's really kind of about principles. like Brian, Brian's thing is not teaching the, the nitty-gritty pretty stuff. Like he's big picture and he talks in terms of like, you know, like the closest to like a tactical thing he talks about is like when you're developing your first order, always have the second order in mind. And that's a helpful like concept that he can riff on. But that's like an example of like the most tactical that he gets. His wheelhouse is just not in really getting into things that you walk away and you're like, oh man, that's amazing. But at the same time, the reason I say I'm not the target market is because there are people in the boot camp who will say, wow, that was amazing. And they loved it.
00:55:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so, I mean, that's like listening to Socrates or Marcus Aurelius you know there's philosophy and some people's brains don't think like that and they haven't had those teachers so that value is huge because the tactics mean nothing if you don't understand the philosophy behind it and I'm with you I want tactics I'm full of philosophy you know but so segmentation first of all of the list and just kind of being able to figure out who is philosophical and who's tactile tactical and being able to serve them more because whoever's you know soaking up the philosophy more that serves a purpose and you can correlate a monetary benefit to that because it changes how you operate because it You know, like you said, principles, um, so, but, but if there's a person who's looking for tactics, that's going to be so annoying and frustrating because there's nothing super actionable or clearly defined. so, um, something to think about is, is there a way and it could be really short and you could use AI for this. So, have AI just go through all the transcripts and say pull out all the principles. Okay. um, do you have suggestions for tactics, for executing these principles inside of a business? Give an example for this type of business, this type of business, this size of business, this financial, you know, monetary thing type of business, and use it to put maybe a little bit more on it. So, um, And then maybe you can just sell that with what was there plus the outline and maybe some supplemental videos that you do as a not a live thing, but a prerecorded course. See what kind of feedback you get on it, maybe drive traffic just to that and not make it super expensive. But now you've captured all of your existing stuff, your repurposing and not doing good. This is what wasn't. Get some reviews on it. then if you only do a live one once or twice a year, then it gets more energy. You kind of bottleneck it so people have to build up and like look forward to it. And it's kind of a launch style instead, which I think would energize Brian. And you know, that's the whole kind of thing, which also reduces how many times you even have to think about doing it. It just starts like that.
00:59:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, the AI thing is a good idea to be able to see what opportunity might be there to make it a little more tactical because that also helps with selling it and being able to talk about what they're going to get. I was about this today during my workout, it's like for Titans, I'm both the visionary and the integrator and I see, like with Tim, like if I were to propose an idea to Tim, it's like hey, I'm going to do this bootcamp and it's going to, because Tim's got a book coming out, right? So, hey, we're going to do this bootcamp around your book. like, Tim would, would put the thing, an outline of the whole thing together. And, and we would get on a call and we would go through that and we would refine it. And Brian is not going to do that. So if anything is going to happen, it's going to be needed to create it. And so in my mind, I think like, well, break through advertising is one thing, because it's, it's an investment, like it's a brand that's going to outlive Brian. And I've created, so I'm motivated to like, to create around that brand.
01:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's tactical by design.
01:00:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
And it's tactical. Yeah. to liver. You know, that's, that's going to be a, that's not our brand beyond Brian and, and he's, it's, I just always felt like I'm pulling Brian. to, you know, whatever you want to call success after his career in boardroom. And he would tell you that too. So, there's a little bit of a, I feel like I want to protect my time with the over-delivered boot camp of like, in and knock this thing out of the park.
01:01:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you get any conversions yet?
01:01:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, yeah. We've added four people into TXL from the 38. The deadline is Sunday. I think we'll probably end up with 15. So, like, that right there is, that's my motivation is like, okay, if this is a good way to get people into TXL.
01:01:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, let's put a number on that. Yeah. you. Let's say you got. 15 people in.
01:02:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
What does that work to you? Uh, 15 people, you know, tell you. Uh, people.
01:02:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Calculate it right in front of you if you want it.
01:02:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
What's that?
01:02:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
there's a calculator right in front of you if you want it on that computer.
01:02:19 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I'm doing it right now.
01:02:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got my calculator up. My brain would go, uh, I can't do math on the band when somebody's looking at me.
01:02:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So that, if we get 15, that's, uh, 5,400 to me.
01:02:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now roughly how much time do you think it spends on it?
01:02:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Uh, the, the, uh, there were six calls, hour and a half.
01:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Include promotions and anything else.
01:02:56 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, this time I just, I just ran the same email. We did on the first one.
01:03:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:03:02 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I didn't rewrite those. I mean, I want to have calls six of them, so six times. So nine, nine hours for the calls and probably another five hours.
01:03:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Want to know that hourly rate roughly? Three hundred and eighty five dollars an hour.
01:03:31 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
01:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, for everything else that I know that you do, I don't think that you average a lot higher than that. Even with your consulting.
01:03:42 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right.
01:03:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So now the other thing is how much you enjoy the time and how tedious it is and that type of thing. Now that's a big factor. And if you can do things that you enjoy more for roughly the equivalent, you know. amount of time so but that's another reason too and and because you know Ryan has help issues that come up that sometimes things have to get rescheduled he's definitely got a lot of things that that can that come up every year there's something he just had another surgery on his heart oh last month lesson so anyway so taking that and figuring out what you can do to optimize it and then making it an evergreen just pre-recording thing and then if you want to having maybe it's once a year over delivered bootcamp and you pre-sell you know and it's like embedded into everything else like at the bottom of the email p s p s that type of thing offering everything hey we're doing this later and then closer to it do a ramp up advertising thing and now that changes everything the energy should be really hot You can have the tactics, can have all the pretty graphics that make Brian excited about it and really make it a big production, which helps with the brand, which I think matters to Brian. And it's over delivering like it's built to over deliver. He can have other gifts like because you guys can kind of, if you're pre selling it and people are buying it. And you can tell him like if you can't make it live, here's the recordings and you get all of these bonuses. Plus here's the best action bonuses if you sign up between this month and this month because we're going to build up for a whole year, that kind of thing. You can really make it a production that helps him feel like he's keeping his brand live and he's feeding his brand. This isn't Jean's stuff, this is his. And so it's kind of an homage. It mitigizes how much work you put into it. You get to build the engine which you love to do, right? engine is the thing. The demo comes duplicatable. for be a bootcamp if you wanted to do it so you can have be a live versus not but since we know that that really is where most of accelerator members come from and they got to play with that a little bit but anyway you are primed to optimize all of this for multiple reasons brian's health yeah um you're you're just simply doing this everywhere and you've got other options so you don't have to be you know he he doesn't have you over a barrel so to speak you know um there's there's so much that's evolved and on top of that AI can really help take existing content that you've gotten over and over again and go what are the best parts of this and really give you some some tools so that even if you're doing it yourself you're not really you know what i mean i get chatgbt4o changed everything
01:07:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know, actually, I think what I would do, because I'm pretty sure, can't you, you can upload videos into chat GPT. I haven't done it yet.
01:07:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've taken video transcripts, but I wouldn't be surprised if you can now.
01:07:15 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you can't, if not, can get a transcript of it, but I think I would take the recordings from this bootcamp and say, listen to this lesson. And, and they help me come up with, you know, specific tactics that, that would go along with it. That I think would be, because when I think about over-delivered, because I've read the book and it's like, like, it, it just, it's, it requires, for me, just a lot of mental energy, like, to make the connection from the philosophical to, like, how do we make this real?
01:07:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you know what else you could do? Is you could build a couple of avatars Say so chat tpt first of all here's all kinds of my Kent called content. Here's my call recordings Here are things that I've written okay learn me First of all profile me. What do you know about me? Okay? me tell you some other things about how I feel about business what annoys me what I like when I'm looking for help This is what I'm looking for here We're gonna build an avatar around me and people like me so that if I'm serving people like me I know how to talk to them and then we're gonna profile Brian's type of person that likes a philosophy. So profile both of them okay, so then you give them the Him it the the over-delivered PDF okay Tell it what you love about it What was good? But tell them what's tedious for you why it's tedious how it's tedious if you could fix it how you would fix it and give an Example like this is written blah blah blah blah blah blah blah all I wanted to say is
01:09:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
this.
01:09:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want a tactical executable thing. For example, this. Okay, now I want you to go through the whole rest of the book. And I want you to pull out five specific tactics that you think are the most leverageable for any business owner. Okay, first, tell me what they are. Let me approve them. Okay, I approve these. Now, I want you to give me the simplest while also being understandable, comprehensible suggestion for tactical implementation in a business. And I want you to give me three examples and turn them into anecdotes starting with one of those tactics. You could probably improve it, but most of that will be actionable all by itself. You can make the over-deliver, you know, basically what, um, BAM is, you know, for BA, something like that, but it it's for you, but guaranteed other people want that. So the pitch to Brian is like, look, not everybody thinks the same way, but the value is still there. Their brains just operate differently. Let's give them this. And so yeah, take all the videos, take the PDF, and then direct it on a mental process, you know, type of vibe avatar.
01:10:34 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
01:10:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think about even exciting too, and take the tediousness out of it, because it's happening so fast, and you get to watch happen and you get to watch it go, I didn't do that. I just directed it, and you whip it all out there. So that could put some energy back into you around something that I felt like it's been draining.
01:10:58 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I mean, the nice thing about the bootcamp is like, I don't have to teach it, and you know, it's like it's a low-ask of me in terms of delivery. I also think that part of, and I share this with Brian's, do think a contributing factor to the number of signups is that we held it in July, because the last time we held it in April. And so I suggested to him, it's like, I think that we should just plan out a bootcamp cadence for the year. So Q1, we do a BA bootcamp, Q2, we do an over-delivered bootcamp, then Q4, we do another BA bootcamp. And we just have those on the calendar.
01:11:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or end of Q3, like, so end of September, where people have been in school, all the college kids are in school, everybody's in school now, and they've had a little time to, you know, because you've got an end. In the country, a huge amount of people start school in August and then September and then the colleges. by the end of September, 1st week of October, you're not in holiday mode and everybody has settled down and starting to fall into their fall routine and I don't think people take enough advantage of that particular time of the year of availability mentally and energetically financially, we recovered the, you know, working during the summer, spending all the expenses there, kind of thing.
01:12:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So anyway, something to take into account. That's true. All right.
01:12:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
got to take my dogs, take your dogs, Hank and, Hank and Hattie, we've got this like calming medicine.
01:12:50 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
We started giving to Hattie for the groupers.
01:12:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. How's that work? What is it?
01:12:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)

00:02:00 - Dan Ryan
They started attacking Mark's site like two days ago. They started attacking another site like within the last week. And that's on top of like we've had these carding attacks going on for close to a month. And so we fixed like the carding attack issue, which took a while. And then all of a sudden they're like, hey, yesterday they're like, sweet love's getting hammered. It's like, come on. What are you talking about?
00:02:36 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
It's not anything good for them to hammer on our site.
00:02:38 - Dan Ryan
It's not like it's an e-commerce site. Yeah, I don't know why. The other ones I understood, yours, I don't understand. And yours, they're trying to, they're trying to get into the admin specifically. So they were specifically attacking the WordPress login.
00:02:52 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Nice.
00:02:54 - Dan Ryan
But since cloud players have been set up, 19 attacks have been stopped. Wow. In less than 21. for hours. So I'm pretty sure because someone had a successful trading attack on one of the sites, and we started getting all these people going, why is this? But what they did was, it was a very sneaky, I've never seen them do this. They did zero dollar transactions. So all they were doing was proving the car was real, and then they were going to probably go use it somewhere else. And we started getting emails from people like, who are you? like, what are you talking about? So I think our IPs or whatever got put on some sort of hacker forum, and then the onslaught started.
00:03:39 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, hosting guys are loving it. We're weird, weird target.
00:03:45 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, totally. It's, yeah, I don't know why they would go, the WooCommerce sites made sense, or so it doesn't make sense.
00:03:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that is so weird. Lidify numbers. Hold on a second. Let me just go look at this because we were talking about updating the report. So can we start there if there's any updates in the new dashboards?
00:04:16 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, I mean, he pushed updates to the dashboards and then. He sent me no. What's Talking about it. Stacey had COVID.
00:04:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So she was a.
00:04:35 - Dan Ryan
out for a week. Oh, yeah, he's so nerdy.
00:04:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like.
00:04:43 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, now I'm like, hey, let's come back to me. So he switched the thing to using resolution data. said that would work, but first he has to explain how it's in the wrong place. Okay. It's in case you want And that was a child object, and I guess that's sad, I don't know. But that's now in the dashboard. As a parent of the policy limits thing is now set up. And we have to look at that. He said he made some assumptions that expenses and damn business and liens are what we're looking for in terms of what would be hitting the policy limit. Is that correct? Yeah, okay. And then the report is only against defendant insurance single person policy limit. And he said, as I'm not sure what the rules of policy limits stacking are in marks various operating states differentiates from state to state. Unfortunately, he did say he knows his . Yeah.
00:05:57 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So Washington, it's sometimes Arizona, it's sometimes, most of time. New Mexico, it's where...
00:06:08 - Dan Ryan
How do we, is there a way to deal with that or not?
00:06:12 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
can check the box for policy limit or not, because it's going to be tied to the resolution tab.
00:06:18 - Dan Ryan
Okay. That box exists? Yes. Okay. I'll let him know.
00:06:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's it? I feel like this report changed a whole lot. And, uh, because, well, let me just go. So, DD intake, DD matters. Let me see which one I'm looking at. Okay. That's never mind. I was looking at intake and I wanted to look at matters. So, when I spoke with Lorenz and Patrick yesterday, I had some questions about things I wanted to put in a report. But I take terrible notes. So one of the things I want to know is I would really like to see, and I know that you, we can't really change this because you pretty much have to take all the cases, but I would be interested to see anyway, what the matters look like by insurance companies, in terms of volume, in terms of how long they take to close, and percentage of policy limits, especially after the way they discussed state farm. Just so that, like even if we can to say, okay, we're not taking state farm cases, obviously we can't do that, but we might be able to find ways to improve processes, improve, let's say, state farm cases take, you know, and on average, a month or two longer to resolve than I other cases, or let's say Geico just blows everybody else out of the water, like, maybe we could find some commonalities in the processes, maybe we could find better ways to improve how we deal with those specific insurance companies in order to get better results. Even again, if it's a 10% lift here or a 2% lift there, everything that we do to improve our operations, improves our operations and leverage. And the other thing is, if everybody's on the same page about it, like, Lorenz felt like it was just him dealing with it for the most part. And he had a slow Q1, and that's really been hurting him, like, in his head, like he's been in his head about it. And I'm like, I have to go back and look at everybody else's numbers, but I know that Q1 kind of slows down for all the sweet lot in terms of... Cases that we get, I don't know what it does to attorney fees if it slows things down there, but what I told them is that there there's a dip for all of Sweet Long Q1 anyway. They really just looked at it.
00:09:13 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
No, there's not.
00:09:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:09:15 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
we usually are one of our better money in months because December, they don't like to send the checks. like to hold them until January.
00:09:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So all of this makes me know at least what I need to dig into better so that I know what I'm actually talking about by the attorneys, by the overall fees and everybody's performance. The other thing is, okay, so we have dropouts and subs by team, but we don't have that in comparison to total at like as a percentage of total cases. So I would like that because there's no, so are you either if you're looking at, let a fire, I could just share my screen, let me share my screen. Yeah, I'm a little far right now, but yeah, I, yeah, so I would like to see this as a percentage of active matters or because this is, this is by time period, right? So this is for the year, this is how many dropped out and how many subouts that they have. And like Lorenz's number is five in Samantha's 12 or 13, but she's got way more cases. I know that. So I have no relationship to, you know, this is by the volume of cases that she has. So looking at this, it would make it look like he's doing better, but percentage wise, they're probably pretty close. I don't know that she's got twice as many cases as him, but she definitely has more. So anyway, Dan, is that something that you could ask for, is that this could be be in relationship to total matters.
00:11:06 - Dan Ryan
Oh, it's over. It's a right now. It's just showing total drops and subs.
00:11:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:11:13 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
What's that? You want to hear it?
00:11:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The year is it's this year's.
00:11:18 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. So, yeah, then it should be able to just overlay number of matters created this year.
00:11:26 - Dan Ryan
Uh, yeah, biotraming.
00:11:29 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, yeah.
00:11:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So just ask, is asking you to get that done enough or do I need to ask you a task for that?
00:11:42 - Dan Ryan
This is the one that sent everything to Josh. So she, you sent it to her and then if she has questions, she asks me. Um, and then her and Josh go back and forth.
00:11:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is dropouts inside by team. I feel like percentage against matters. So and then Mark, would you have any interest and is it possible? Do you track and litify what insurance company the matters are assigned to it? Yeah. So would you be interested in looking at a breakdown of those cases?
00:12:53 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Sorry, let me take that back. The names are in there but it's not like a drop down. on picklist. I don't know if we'll be able to filter it, because it definitely says like State Farm or Skyco or whatever else, but it's not from like a picklist.
00:13:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I mean, I wish we could use that AI like the I know we're on the beta list for it. So maybe it's something we could do in the future. But for right now, could we create it? Could we create that and on the processes side, knowing that, hey, these are the same issues that we all run into, trying to deal with State Farm, like is there anything that we can do to improve that process? Whatever, can we capture some best practices of what we observe is happening with other insurance companies?
00:13:53 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know, we don't know what we can do this. Honestly, I don't think it's going to make a large difference to be framed with you.
00:14:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think It'll be a large difference. I do think that the whole path to optimization is little different from just here and there.
00:14:07 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, no, yeah, yeah.
00:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you? So, you know, if you're not interested in it, that's fine. I think it will be more about helping the team learn some things, even if they can see the numbers and go, okay, I'm not crazy. And this really does have this big of an impact. And just being able to help them visualize and go, you know, this, this, your experience is not unique. It's across the board and, but from there, if there's a bright spot, for example, and that this goes back to the book switch, which I had, I don't remember, actually I had Fuji read that one, but anyway, where sometimes by the way, just FYO. He does, yay. He's awesome. And they're gonna have a baby Monday.
00:15:03 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I'm so excited.
00:15:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If Mark referred me to a doctor friend of his.
00:15:10 - Dan Ryan
Oh, right. Yeah, you told me that.
00:15:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:15:13 - Dan Ryan
all coming back to me.
00:15:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm right. Anyway, um, anyway, so the point is that sometimes little things stick out and like we might notice that somehow one of your team members does better with with one particular insurance company than everybody else does. And so we wouldn't we wouldn't know that because we look at the report and it may just be like, Hey, this is just how we do business and they might have found a solution that they're not even aware is a solution, but it shows up in the reports consistently that they do better on this particular type of thing. So that's the whole thing about tracking all the data points that we can identify. And then looking at them and going, why. is that different? You know what I mean? So for the amount of effort that it would take to create the drop down list and then to select things, that's not really significant in terms of workload and for us to look at the data is not very significant. But let's say it just makes a little bit of improvement or let's say that it's a mental improvement for your team just going, yeah, this is what we think it is. It's not just me. That's significant. That improves morale. That gets people out of their heads and that helps them, you know, free up their mental energy for just doing their work instead of sitting there feeling bad about some of the stuff that's not going well. Does that make sense? So on whose end, who would set this up so that we can have a drop down menu and let if I for your team to start tracking what the insurance company is that we can put this into a report. probably I think because we'll have all the big ones and then we'll just have one that just says other because there's a lot of just one offs if you will like some go with which is Hyundai Japan we've got like two cases over the last three years from then like not enough to create a drop down um the drop down I see is like you know again psycho mercury infinity usa like the big ones okay cool and then um uh whatever it's called something I'm saying AI if and won't get there scratch um just see the retro actively if possible right so let me just see if there was anything else that I wanted to look at in here Can we sort it, let's see. I got that. All right, that was it for report updates based off of talking to the guys. So, um, how many cases did you have? I didn't look at that for July so far.
00:18:31 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, we actually read 22.
00:18:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What? Yeah. You're kidding me. That is wild. That's cool. Uh, unexpected.
00:18:50 - Dan Ryan
Unexpected. for, especially going into a holiday weekend. Yeah.
00:18:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:18:57 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
little fresh rate has got subbed up by sweet James. 20 minutes after HQ intake sent us the signed agreement.
00:19:04 - Dan Ryan
Wow.
00:19:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
00:19:06 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Wow. Wow.
00:19:08 - Dan Ryan
Wow.
00:19:09 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Wow. My guest is trying to sign up and then went to like search for us to call and had sweet James. So. I really need to make sure that we are owning the PPC for sweet loss, sweet attorneys, we lawyers. Sweet law firm.
00:19:33 - Dan Ryan
Oh, my God. Are you sure? I mean, you're pretty sure that's what You signed up and then was like, Oh, I need to ask him a question or something.
00:19:55 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
And then tried to call back because as we kept calling and texting us follow up, she texted Yes. My law firm is sweet Jane is please stop calling me. And so I texted her to Denise over there. I'm like, Hey, is this a client of yours? You know, sometimes clients think we're sweet James or whatever.
00:20:12 - Dan Ryan
Yeah.
00:20:14 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
And they're like, yeah, she signed yesterday. I'm like, what time she she signed with us at 3 11 p.m. And she's like 3 33 p.m. So like the timing is just too tight for it to be much anything else.
00:20:27 - Dan Ryan
Sure.
00:20:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Was she just not just confused? Like she thought she signed up with them, but really she signed with you.
00:20:35 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
She signed her a dinner with sweet James. Oh, she did. OK, later though, correct. So she signed with us first. Yeah. So that's why I'm thinking that she must have been gooling online to like call or get some started or to ask a question and then come to James instead. Because the time is just too close for it to be. Oh, yeah, yeah, totally.
00:20:57 - Dan Ryan
I don't know if someone's somewhere ready to feel comfortable.
00:20:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So now I'm going to call someone else. That's weird.
00:21:02 - Dan Ryan
That is super weird.
00:21:06 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I don't So, yeah, enough about that one.
00:21:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Washington, man.
00:21:12 - Dan Ryan
Also not thrilled that those guys did basically talk to her out of staying with you because they had to. But that's unsurprising.
00:21:21 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I mean, I thought we kind of had the gentleman's agreement about this, but yeah, it also sounded like she didn't mention that she'd sign anything with anything. So maybe.
00:21:31 - Dan Ryan
Oh my God, these people are so stupid.
00:21:35 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
My friend, the business is built on people doing stupid things.
00:21:39 - Dan Ryan
No, no. They make you wonder why I didn't why didn't she think she signed anything is it makes me wonder like. What is the HQ sign up process like are they texting her and he signed like. His system is so . And the dude will not respond to me like I'm about to send a new. email, just so you know, I was waiting to talk to you. I'm going to send an email to you and him saying, I think you should just leave quantify with them and move everything else. Because I swear to you, I go in and I'm like, those are the same exact notes, you are not calling these people. But I can't say that explicitly. I did kind of intimate that.
00:22:23 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
And last thing I dropped down that they're just picking from a checklist on the note.
00:22:29 - Dan Ryan
No, it's not. Definitely not.
00:22:31 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
It's not there.
00:22:32 - Dan Ryan
They're too weird. Like the notes are very specifically non-specific.
00:22:38 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
can pull value over. not a problem. can stop that.
00:22:44 - Dan Ryan
Yeah. And then it's like, we could just just leave like you were saying leave them with quantifies because I met with the ad certainly guys. that guy just he just opened the air table of all their clients and just was scrolling through showing me. And I do still think That his Washington guy is that because he's multi state that they're signing cases and subbing and sending them out and I also think that they have to be signing just bad cases. And then these guys are never going to hear her. Oh yeah, we ended up just totally tossing that right. So that's hard to why their results are so good but literally dude.
00:23:26 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Or within the span of a week. That's a $56.
00:23:31 - Dan Ryan
Right. But then the span of a week, the other firm, whoever they are, I haven't been able to figure out who it is. Sign two passenger band cases in Washington. I'm like, where are those? dude, really? he walked me through their follow up system is like. Literally three calls in the first hour. Like he's like, it's, they're so aggressive, but, and then it seems to tie to their. results. So he's super duper motivated to like, I want this to work. He's like, I want sweet lot to just stick around. I want you guys to be like a long-term client. So I'm thinking like if we take their leads and then alter the follow up just for them, right? So create a laboratory around ad-serbly. Here's what we know, their leads to convert. The first round they ended up getting the lower one of the lowest cost per retainers. I think ever that since we've been testing vendors, they're super communicative, they're super data-driven, totally show everything except their websites. He actually, he's the one that I was like, you know what that quantifies doing. He's like, yeah, this is their site. So it's super sketchy, by the way, but maybe I shouldn't tell you so I won't. And then you don't know. Okay.
00:25:01 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
When you say super sketchy, like they're fitting on other people's names, that's going to create a lawsuit for me sketchy.
00:25:11 - Dan Ryan
Create a lawsuit for you. I'm not going to say that that's what they're doing. Would something like that create a lawsuit for you?
00:25:17 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
It's not you doing it. Potentially. So Google, Quintessa marketing.
00:25:23 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, I know who they are. Yeah.
00:25:25 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. That's why we don't use Quintessa.
00:25:27 - Dan Ryan
So their entire strategy is that. And not only is that their entire strategy. Injury.com is.
00:25:39 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So that makes sense more why the Sweet James thing happened with Quantify. She may have been looking for Sweet James all along.
00:25:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:25:51 - Dan Ryan
So who's injury.com?
00:25:54 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I think that's Morgan.
00:25:58 - Dan Ryan
Yeah. Look it up. It's somebody big. It is... It's an injury and Morgan and Morgan. Yeah, so I thought it was Morgan. Oh, it's an interesting sight. does not look like a lawyer's sight. Their domain is not injury.com. It's lowercase L N G U R Y dot com. And I'm like, wow. Okay. Creative. That's super creative. And so they're using LINGERY dot com. guess that's a word. And then they do competitor to targeting. Because I ran them through a harass. And I looked at all the keywords that they're buying. And there's a couple. There's a couple that you can't say for sure. They're getting the leads from competitor to targeting. They're also going after some. I mean, I would say they're low volume keywords, but. Yeah.
00:26:58 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
That is what they're talking about.
00:26:59 - Dan Ryan
Injured. of course. And they're not like ripping off the website, their website's ugly as well, get out. And they have the most convoluted form. I'm like, I cannot believe they actually get leads, but they obviously they do. Totally. mean, it's working. So competitor targeting works, brand competitor targeting. Quintessa, they're on this guy probably worked at Quintessa what you're going to find out.
00:27:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
have a question. If you guys are done with that topic, but if you're not, I'll wait. Okay, so this is resolutions by teams by month, but the report is pulled according to that date at the top. is this just mislabeled?
00:27:54 - Dan Ryan
Yeah.
00:27:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
copy. And this one is well, Yeah, it should be that if you adjusted the time, then you know, right, do you need that? Okay, so, um, so I'm going do the report. What the crap just happened? I don't know what just happened. Okay. Um, what's it called? I think it's because I pieced it in it. Resolution 13 by month. So, is there Is there any difference in significance? Because this is the case as close as we've done our part, this is when we get paid, right? Close versus resolution.
00:29:10 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Correct.
00:29:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so is resolution even something relevant on a biotin kind of thing today? Okay, and which of these do you think is more valuable? Are they the same in terms of tracking?
00:29:27 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
If have to pick one, close is more important, but the factors in the legal team is how many cases did you settle?
00:29:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because once you settle it, we know money's coming in.
00:29:40 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Right. And then obviously, did it come in because we have to have cash flow?
00:29:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, okay, so this is just interesting, just digging into this a little bit. Um, the case is close. I don't, I don't know. how to value this because of so many different factors and how long the cases stay open. So could we talk about that a little bit so that I can understand it better? Like if you look at this, what do you think about it?
00:30:21 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, this makes sense to me. The resolutions are usually hard when cases closed.
00:30:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I mean like Lorenz versus Samantha or Tyler even. Do you want to see this compared to last year? This is this year because there's a big change. I just find it interesting, but I don't. know how to weigh it. What I would like to see is the average length of time. It takes to close the case by team also. But again, report on that.
00:31:20 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So we should be able to add it to this.
00:31:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. Okay. any thoughts. So this again, this is last year. Lauren's had 155 for the whole year and Sam had 2001 or 2001 Tyler 174. I'm really going to look at anybody else. then this year, Lorenz is at 125 Sam 120, Tyler 109. So Tyler's kind of like keeping right behind Samantha, which is what was doing. But does this say anything to you about Lorenz's performance?
00:32:22 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
That he's dragging on getting some cases resolved, because look, he's only settled 120, but he somehow paid out 125.
00:32:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, is that not the other way around?
00:32:35 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Closed is after resolution is before. happens before closing.
00:32:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, OK. I thought it was the other way around. OK. So resolved is when they settled the case. Closed is we've been paid. OK. When I asked that question, I asked it the other way around, and you said that was correct. So we missed each other. All right. well, okay, can you look at it in terms of these numbers? wait, hold on a second. that's the case, then let me look at this. So 120 and 173, and let me go to last year for resolutions. Two thirty one. We're twenty one. That's okay. Okay. Sorry, I'm just still trying to like wrap my head around.
00:33:42 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
The numbers are going to be off, no matter what, because some cases have more than one resolution, but none are going to have more than one close date.
00:33:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, regardless what I'm looking at, I'm trying to look at improvement on the team or at least trajectory. Same, improving, declining numbers you would have to pull are these two numbers that you know, you pull our average attorney fee. I'm looking at that.
00:34:13 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Right. And then time from open to close, which we don't have yet on this report.
00:34:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but we certainly can pull it because we have an open date in a closed date. we can definitely make that happen. Yeah, well, so we'll get that added to here so we can just look at it all together. So but the fact that he's he's resolving more cases, like he's he's getting closer to Samantha's pace. This year does that doesn't say anything to you because of the attorney fees?
00:34:46 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Well, let's do it mathematically, 173 divided by 120. So she's 1.44 times faster than him.
00:34:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and that's the Let's look at last year, though, because she was more than that last year, she was almost 33%.
00:35:11 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
1.38.
00:35:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay, so last year, his average attorney fees for the year were 14,000 and hers were 18, and they've both dropped so far this year. Hars are 17, I think, and his is 11.
00:35:41 - Dan Ryan
What makes her faster?
00:35:43 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
that's the question, I guess. That's really what it comes down. She micromanages her team.
00:35:51 - Dan Ryan
Lauren, she has a process that she micromanages.
00:35:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, and she has a team because you guys to move things around that is compatible with her doing that, right? if she had Cynthia on her team, that would make an impact, because Cynthia probably can't handle that very well. Cynthia is on Patrick's team, But I'm saying if she was on Samantha's team, that would probably impact Sam's production. But Cynthia also probably wouldn't last very long in Sweet Law, if that was her only option. Is that also right, do you think? So that's part of the, that's one of the things I'm actually really excited about in learning to work with these guys, because here's the thing, we all know that you can't just go hire everybody that can work at Sam's pace. What we can do is see if there are some of the processes that she does. Sorry, it's my damn reminder. And the styles that she has that can be, you know, implemented elsewhere. where what I do know is Patrick's gunning for her numbers. And every time he asks her questions, she answers thoroughly, doesn't hold back, gives lots of information, and he's soaking it all up. So that's good. I don't know, like, so Lorentz has Gary and he's saying that she, like trying to get any information from her is like pulling teeth. And I asked him if he thought it was because she is just a withholding type of person, doesn't talk much, or if she's a little bit like I'm a single mom with four kids, I don't want to rock the boat, I'm just going to show up and like try not to make waves. And so that's the conversation we're going to dig into a little bit more next week and find out if, because that's the case. So I was explaining to them that several times I've hired a right-hand person and it's been a female too. to support CEOs that I'm working with, case in point Dan and Stacey. Stacey's job was from the beginning to help with accountability, make sure that things get captured, follow up with people and make sure jobs are getting done. But even though she knew that from the beginning, she was very hesitant to do it. She improved it over time as she kind of like dipped her toe in a on this. Nobody's going to yell at me. Nobody's going to hate me. You know, this isn't going to create a hostile environment. And so now she's really good. I'd be like, hey, where's this? You said you were going to do this. Where's this? You know what I mean? Which is what it was from the beginning, but she had because of previous work experience and just how a lot of times women who behave that way show up and are treated, they're just like, eh, I don't want to do that because someone's going to call me a , basically. So. Oh, I'm wondering if Viri might have had that type of experience where maybe we can encourage it out of her to talk a little bit more about whatever's going on, where she needs help, what can be improved, because at the end of the day, like we know it's difficult to find new people, to onboard them, to train them, whatever, it takes a long time to replace anybody, really, especially your attorneys, so everything that we can do to make them more independent, more strong, more autonomous, better communicators, more reliable, like Patrick said, Cynthia is doing better after he has just sit there and tell her, this is what you need to do. Don't wait for me to tell you to do this, do this. But he did it in a way where he was super concerned about not hurting her feelings, not plowing over her in, in, in, And he said that, you know, he doesn't get really stressed out about everything, like he's driven, he's competitive, but the things that stress them out, like talking to difficult clients, people that are mad, yelling at them, whatever, he's like, that doesn't bother him at all because of his training. So anyway, just all these different things, like looking at these numbers, there's, there's a compatibility thing on the pot, right? So Sam's team probably has people who are more on the pace of being able to go hard, have her drive them. And let's say Patrick could do that. He doesn't have people necessarily. I don't know how elsey or at least it's elsey, right? Oh, yeah. don't know, you know, what she can handle pace wise, but it isn't pace caps, basically. Oh, and one of the things that Patrick asked about was how, and I know that he's not on the incentive program yet, but he's thinking about what does he do, how does he keep them motivated and driven to keep working harder when they don't get incentive pay for working harder. He says, if it was me, I wouldn't be motivated to work any harder than I am. And Lauren said what he does is he takes incentive pay out of his pocket to give to his team. And I was wondering, you know, is there a sweet lot policy for that? Like it, it does it not behoove you to create a program that is based on the team or do you want it managed as though basically everybody's their own, not just pod, but like their own little company and the attorneys have like, you know, it's almost like it's their own business inside of your business, where they're figuring out how to incentive pay them.
00:41:59 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I wasn't. Yeah. Yeah, that's something that I haven't done particularly well. Sam's team gets paid on a quarterly bonus if they hit their goal for the quarter. Tyler pays at his team more ad hoc month to month. Lorenz is doing the same. It hasn't been a formalized program and part of the reason is because the attorneys get paid so much. Like our payroll's 34% of our gross, which is high. should be like 25%. But Mary and I have talked about creating like a quarterly incentive plan. Not even just quarterly but half yearly because full years too long for people who are going to miss by September, they're just going to stop trying. So to do it where it's 30,000 per attorney if they can hit the goals for six months straight, basically. On average, you know, I don't want them to
00:43:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
hold cases that's always the problem and then for the teams to split up 6 000 between each of them so most teams have four people so it'd be like 1,500 each so okay i'm sure like three grandi here i i would love to sit with you and try to work that out a little bit more because i feel like first of all your attorneys um you want them to have a certain amount of but they're not all putting the same level of business training and experience and leadership as you are and i think that you're better off as having consistency across your company me, rather than having almost like individual companies within your company, because ultimately, they look to you, your attorneys look to you, you're, and I think that you'll just get better results across the board if it's a corporate right wide kind of structure, and helping helping your leaders be better leaders, not micromanaging them, but being aware of their data, giving them some reviews, just saying like, you know, this is how your team is performing month over month, quarter over quarter, year over year, et cetera. Yeah, so could we set a goal for having completed and implemented that type of incentive program for the teams so that they do all have incentive programs to work? for performance-wise.
00:45:02 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, but I'd rather do it sooner rather than later because we can still do that back up the year because it's only the first week of July.
00:45:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, it's only limited by when you want to do it and when you're willing to do it. We could have an extra meaning if we needed to, but I would really like to see that happen because I think that it really supports everybody, your attorneys and the teams.
00:45:23 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I think Monday we should definitely talk about it then.
00:45:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so let me do that and put that in my notes. Okay, I think that was it for right now in terms of like you What was already in my brain now? have to kind of just process what I was talking about are while while I'm waiting for my brain to catch up and think about the next thing. Um, was there anything new that's come up that you want to discuss? Oh, actually. I do want to tell you what something that Lorenz did which I was impressed with. It's not a major thing and it should have happened anyway, but it did and that's the point is that Lorenz was doing through multiple iterations working with file reviews as a team. And he's basically got the two like sub pods Jessica and Mike and then John and Barry. And they were all meaning together going over file reviews, but the team had complained that they're basically wasting time while one pod goes over there. did that about month ago and I will find out more this week how he tracked this and how he can quantify, qualify what he said but what he said was he can notice an improvement in their trajectory having gone over the five hour views together that it's making an improvement but it's only a month long and I don't know how he's tracking and measuring it but just the fact that he's gotten to that point was I think it was good that he's working on first of all noticing what the team needs and just trying to get everybody on the same page trying to improve performance and trying to lead them yeah so I didn't want to say that let's see everyone does I was looking at my star stuff yeah anyway okay so that was it now Is there anything that we haven't brought up that you want to tell us about or ask about?
00:48:10 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Really I mean the issuing ticket figure out what we're gonna do with it.
00:48:13 - Dan Ryan
We're gonna pull things from them or what not I'm all for pulling I mean like I'm doing a lot better than we are quite frankly now For like HQ intake, sorry So we can keep them with what they're gonna quantify right now, and then yeah And I think So the absurdly thing like him and I we mapped it out like on the phone It's the big thing that they did was three calls in an hour, right? So I Could create an automation that's the add-surdly automation That does that so it's like oh Okay, let's try this more aggressive thing with the lead source that's getting those results elsewhere, right? what we have is we know the intake team can close. We know that certainly the leads can close. So the bit that's different that supposedly is driving their clients average 14% whereas we've only ever seen five from any vendor except for malquantify who well we know maybe their numbers are better. So it's like okay if it's either that and I don't know that I mean I don't know that it certainly gets better leads and I guess technically they do if you compare look at them as like a monkey but it's like okay if this dude's gonna be like hey what can we do to make this better? Hey no one else has ever done that. It's like okay. Hey, what can we make this better? That would be making a custom automation that's just for them. And then it's like, OK, does it lift? Do we get a lift from adding three calls on the front end? And because if the call connects, it came over, right? The calls connected, the intake team's taking over. So that seemed to be the biggest differentiator that we don't have. I say build and add thirdly automation, run their leads through that, and see what happens. And pull from HQ.
00:50:41 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
OK.
00:50:44 - Dan Ryan
All right. Then that's what we're going to do.
00:50:47 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So just recap for HQ, we'll just have them do the quantified leads.
00:50:52 - Dan Ryan
And I'll pull the TRG leads. Yeah, so we changed quantified to come to us. first. So now, like, so basically we're like, for some reason, though, they're still getting I know, Eric, Eric hit up, don't go or submit or whatever their name is. He confirmed that it was that way. And I'm like, but that if that doesn't make the thing that you said. So I'm not sure how it's occurring. And Eric, I haven't, Eric has not figured it out yet. But we will. But the point is that we're making it so that, like, we're the first point of contact that therefore we can always control it and see and see what's going on. Because when they do it, it's like, you got to reach out to them. then what are you doing about what is
00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. And take script where we at with that.
00:52:07 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
We've gone through it more than a few times. It still not where I would like it to be.
00:52:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. So, are, is it going to stay on your schedule to keep going through it? Like where I don't want it to die on the vine.
00:52:32 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
It's not, it's got to get done within the next week and a half because then I've only got past two or two more weeks. it has to be done before he goes.
00:52:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And we have been discussing trying to figure out a way to create a client slash case ranking system to. Well, help intake. Just better figure out the call. I feel like the intake script would be a good preface to that.
00:53:07 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
It is starting the conversation the right way.
00:53:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:53:15 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, so they just throw over the place when they start.
00:53:22 - Dan Ryan
Right. When's Pat?
00:53:23 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
When's Pat too even?
00:53:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Two weeks.
00:53:25 - Dan Ryan
Okay. I'm gonna, if you're good with to refer to be like, hey, I'm gonna compile the whole thing. What's currently there and the ones that I sent you and I'd be like, hey, we're gonna make this switch and it looks like it will resolve a bunch of typing that they do. And because they I'd go through a bunch of leads because of the ads, at least stuff. And I'm like, Oh, we gotta get this in. So if you're good with that, I'm gonna compile those into one giant list and be like, Hey, this is the new Then I can go back to Josh and he can back sort of back turned on reason people. That's going to be a little bit of a , but it'll happen in the background.
00:54:13 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:54:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, that covers everything that I had.
00:54:20 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Well, Patsy's out. We're splitting her role kind of into. So we're to do one that double check files before they're converted because she's very. Detail oriented. And then Mia is going to be the backup of yes or no to cases because she's been around the long since seen the most. So she has a pretty good idea of what to take enough to take more questions to ask.
00:54:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:54:48 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Obviously, I'm going to be heavily, heavily, heavily involved, but you know, we have to go back in case I'm on an airplane or something. And they're told basically if. They have any questions at all. Just put it on the attorney intake channel of the attorneys to decide whether they take it or not.
00:55:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because we've talked about this before, down the road a little bit, especially after I've had some more time working with Patrick and Lauren's because it's really illuminating to me. Maybe we could spend a little time, maybe a quarter or something working with the intake team.
00:55:25 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:55:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But let's get the scripts first. Maybe we could come up with the client ranking system. All of that could probably go hand in hand, let's get them on a jumping off point.
00:55:38 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
And then Patsy's going to be gone for how long? Six months.
00:55:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, right.
00:55:45 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So probably come back to the beginning of the year. Some point for coming back around Christmas. So probably the beginning of the year.
00:55:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And something for you to just ponder is, would it be more useful to try to. get something going before she comes back because she's gone to just add some strength or wait till she gets back and get everybody on the same page. I think part of that is just kind of watching and seeing what happens first getting the intake script and seeing what happens with that. But I do think sooner rather than later, I think Q4 might be a really good time to get some of that work done while we're heading into the new year, things kind of slow down anyway. And so maybe that would be a good time to not be too overwhelming but then to get them going the holidays. But anyway, so if you could just ponder over that and think about what- And you just see how they do first what Patu's going quite frankly. Okay, yeah, so well and that would that would line up with it too so we get some observation time but okay cool. So we'll table that for a little bit and Anything else? Okay. All right. Well, I was just thinking about the very beginning of this conversation and just wishing you the best of luck. Oh, Mark, I've been meaning to ask. Gosh, I keep getting, because I don't have my phone in my hand when I mean to ask you, but what are you doing in the mornings now?
00:57:34 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Meditation for about the first 30 minutes.
00:57:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You are.
00:57:40 - Dan Ryan
What kind of meditation?
00:57:45 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Through the nose, after the nose, then something called bliss meditation.
00:57:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you doing that at home?
00:57:54 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Are you going to the office and doing it? I'm doing it at home in five in the morning. I'm not going to the office as soon as I wake up.
00:58:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I was just checking because they're staying so late. don't know what's going on.
00:58:05 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Like, I'm just going to be upset like, you know, before seven. Here's two plus hours.
00:58:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you're not checking your phone right away anymore, right?
00:58:20 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Rarely. Like when I first get up, I just look at it to make sure there's not like, you know, 20 missed calls from someone or something.
00:58:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's it. You don't get pulled into anything.
00:58:35 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
No, I get the other stuff done first.
00:58:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good job. Good job. I was, I was really worried about how that was going to start going. So nice job. Very, very glad to hear that. OK, all right, then. Put the mommy team that way from the next. was worried about you. All right, number questions, number, anything. Can we same time next week? No, no, not same time.
00:59:03 - Dan Ryan
Monday, next week. Yeah, I was like, I don't think so.
00:59:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what day it is already. I'm out of it. I won't see my girls for four days. So I'm just like, anyway, all right. Well, Mr. Mark, have a, and Dan, we have a meeting right after this. So, Mark, have a good holiday and a great weekend and take very good care of yourself.
00:59:26 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Stop.
00:59:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, ease.
00:59:30 - Dan Ryan
Bye.
00:59:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Bye.
00:59:32 - Dan Ryan
Bye.
00:59:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Let's see. Oh, wait. Do you need a break or anything?

Hey, hey.
00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, What's going on? When did I need my name?
00:00:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because I'm sick. Sick has got the blood drawn yesterday morning and you're just having.
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, my daughter came home sick and she got. So I've got my inhaler and been taking my silver and I already feel better but I'm still like.
00:00:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Got it.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then this morning my daughter comes in and she's flashing light in the darkness in my eyeball. And I'm like and I never say Jesus Christ and I say Jesus Christ.
00:00:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry.
00:00:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, I thought she was talking about my daughter for a minute.
00:00:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It could be a dog.
00:00:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Dog. I walk out and I smell this god-awful smell. I'd never smelled before and The dog was filming at the mouth.
00:01:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like what's going on. I'm like it's got me a skunk But it didn't smell like a skunk, but it was filling up my whole house the smell Oh God.
00:01:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it smelled like chemically and Not like a skunk, but it had to have been just a weird skunk We've had these experiences before it did permeate through the whole house if my daughter Mm-hmm up just smelling her dog. Yeah, she got sprayed right in the mouth dog So that's how I woke up and it wasn't even seven o'clock yet in the morning Yeah, so that on top of being sick and we had like body aches in my just yeah But and I feel good enough I get the job done, so Walk up and did my missionary stuff and I snuck like a shower during one of the calls because we're not on video and I muted myself and I'm like I'm just gonna listen and get my shower and right after I got out they like had a question for me so I'm like nobody knows and it's okay so so what did you do with the dog then what's happening with the dog right now she's okay okay yeah she it just had happened so she hadn't processed it and body but she had some water and she was too a lot just making that face and she's okay and I couldn't believe how much this because we have medical grade at HEPA filters throughout the house since COVID but also we all have asthma and the pollen around here is insane yeah so it did a really good job of clearing out smell pretty well and I can't believe it. leave because I prayed. I'm pretty sure miracles are just happening because the oils in the skunk are just they're pervasive. They take a long time to dissipate and go away. She didn't get a bath or anything but it's yeah it's the worst and the best skunk experience we've ever had. Worst as in how bad it was but best isn't how quickly it's it's like we still smell it but anyway she's okay she's out barking her head off right now. Oh my gosh and you're on fire yeah your pad just being like breaking it down. I watched while I was on my training for a minute because there were some because there was the board so I was like that's awesome.
00:03:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah yeah no yeah yeah I'm excited and I had a really good call this guy yesterday that's potentially more like just for me on the off offer stuff because he had a funnel builder that was doing stuff for him and that funnel builder just changes business model to not have any customers anymore and he's just gonna focus on his own offers. So he was wondering if I could take over and run ads for him and all that jazz. So I'm like, okay, cool. Yeah, let's do it. So yeah, that's kind of what's happening now is is to later on today, I told him said I want him to think I was a what do you go? Desperate of this that so he asked if I could send him just a detailed either a contract or or send him a details of what's more out of scope. That's what he'd like to learn more about. Not what's in scope. was going and so 5,000 months didn't phase him at all. So let's do it for 90 days, but obviously if you don't like it or you're You don't like it, you know, whatever, like I'm not going to hold you to the 90s, but I feel we should have that at least, but you got legs like I looked at his funnel. He just needs to optimize it. And I think it'll rock for him. And I also believe I don't know if you're like this now to I don't believe high ticket sells so well in this economy. So he needs in the real estate niche. He's a realtor. He's very successful what he does. And he's got a great book.
00:05:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think he wants to become like the next brand new chart, which I think is really cool. I don't it's the economy.
00:05:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I want to talk after that. Okay, sure. Okay, yeah, yeah, we love to talk. This is that is a podcast episode or video for us to do. So, but yeah, so he's trying to send them into a $3,500 thing. And I said, you know, honestly, if I run your shoes, I really feel you should have more 500 or 900 or 300 thing to assemble too. And I think that's going to make you 50k months easily with this funnel because the real estate niche have been in it. I'm very experienced and I even how I was there when Chris Michore just started because I was with the ad agency So, you know, saw her when she was nobody and everybody knows who she is, but she started in real estate now She teaches all things business, but uh, so anyways, um, yeah He's certainly open to that because I really feel You're setting yourself up for fail failure because then you have a sales team then you gotta deal with this and he doesn't want that He makes good money in his real estate business.
00:06:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He doesn't want to deal with that or manage people.
00:06:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So anyways Um, he's Looked like he's a yes. Uh, yeah yesterday on the phone. He and he on zoom call We energetic are really aligned the Ford for his book was written by one of his friends who's Bob Berg of the go-giver So like he's very heart centered Um, person so um, anyways, I understand he just wants to know what's in scope. What's not in scope Is it okay? I'll just craft you I told him I'd do it tomorrow, is today So once I have that then that will alleviate a lot of pressure to have five thousand Coming in for that, plus he's a fun guy to work with.
00:07:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I thought as soon as you said the price point, and for 90 days I'm like, okay, that just created the space that you need it. But it's actually because, but what you also need is you need the boon of what's been, what you've been having to deal with is the energy of it. wouldn't say it started with Carina, but it definitely maybe was probably most noticeable and painful with Carina of not being respected. That is an emotional heart pain, and you had Rudy, and I'm coming from these kinds of experiences as well. I'm speaking because I know what they feel like to not be honored, especially when you show up and give everything.
00:07:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, yeah, let me turn my box around. And this is to have some
00:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
but nickel and dime you.
00:08:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, try to be miserly with you.
00:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But say, I see your expertise at that price makes sense to me, at least like it isn't a done deal yet. But yeah, once you start dealing with people who honor you, you are your energy is completely different. You're not coming from a defensive and making space and now your creativity flows.
00:08:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Also your generosity increases because your fear can diminish because you know that there are good people out there.
00:08:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's very cathartic and releasing and powerful. But when you're already a generous person, it actually increases your generosity because somebody kind of restored your faith and humanity a little bit, you know. But something to think about. So in terms of the economy, there is just as much money as there always has been. If not more, it has shifted. There's a greater priority, but the bigger issue. is the economy of trust. The trust economy has what's been most damaged. So there are too many people stealing and promising big things. And hey, I'm so and so, and you just get my time. You get access to me, you get access to my community.
00:09:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's worth $10,000, it's not.
00:09:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need results for $10,000. So and most of these things are just, here let me throw all of this information at you, but there are a lot of gaps. It's not actionable. There, there isn't a support system where you can ask a specific question where you need to get. So for most people, they have realized, so this is the trust part, it's part of the trust is that they need, if they're going to spend that much money, it needs to get them a certain level of results. They're really, like people didn't ask this question. and have this realization that they're giving to you this week, which is I need an implementer because they realize they're not the one. So people that used to throw money away and the whole just kind of energy that you could do this throw money away and you would get something out of it doesn't exist anymore. There's a whole new market, but the market is coming in more educated realizing I can't just give five or ten thousand dollars and my life is going to change. So that's the big issue. can't there will be people who will pay money just for access, right? that's one thing that's my guy who's always told people people will pay for access and that's true. They will pay a lot of money to get into somebody's world. But that's not everybody. That's a small person and that person already knows what the value and the benefit of being in
00:11:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
in that connection is, right?
00:11:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the results, they've already calculated, they've already done that. Everybody else, which is the majority of the people need to have a tactical result, which is this thing that I can't talk myself into building, or I can't even comprehend how to build front like backwards and forwards, where I can build, but I don't know how to mark it, where I can mark it, but I don't know how to build that kind of thing that there's always one of those gaps, right? Yep. They need to have that solved. So for the person selling something, the person selling has to decide what do I want to deal with, okay? So we already know what we want to give and what we can sell and what we can offer, but there's a burden involved in fulfillment. So if the thing is we want to help realtors be better realtors. I want to help realtors be better realtors, but I just want to share with them what I know. I don't want to deal with customers. support. I don't want to deal with one on one calls. I don't want to deal with live events, right? So then you get a lower ticket thing that just says, here's what you can learn, okay? I just created a material for you. I don't have a lot to deal with it, so I'm going to give it kind of inexpensive, but I can give it over and over and over again because I know how valuable it is. So that person, you know, your guy who doesn't want to do a lot might consider that. The other thing he can consider is bringing in so maybe you create community and then you're looking for the excited kind of go-getters or the experienced person and then you deputize them and go, hey, would you be interested in being a moderator? Would you be interested in being a junior coach or whatever? And so now they build into the model, you take somebody that you acquired through the funnel to begin with to be a leader and those leaders, they're different because they're also loyal now. not like you went out and hired somebody. They found you, they already been sold and converted and they drank the Kool-Aid. So they're ideal to support your community and now you can charge a higher tier because now you can offer support but you're not doing it. You're facilitating it, you're paying for it, you've created a system that brings the leaders in, you create a system that can train the leaders so you can train your trainers but you don't actually do it. So he could be working with some high level people on occasion which helps him keep his saw sharp and just you know keeps tucked into his business and so like if the market ever just crashes he's got this other thing over here. love the market crashes he's not going to be a selling that very well. But anyway something to consider about that but I don't think so the economy is definitely bad but it's really mostly bad for people who struggle to get jobs in the first place. who, so for entrepreneurs if they're targeting broke people That was already an issue, which is Karina.
00:14:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And that's why her business. So I had put the glasses on and I prevent ice cream. Yeah, I really feel that sort of Karina in a way happened to her with her list. And that's why. Yeah, because they just weren't responding anymore. Like it was hard to get sales from the compared to a year ago. Same emails, right? So, yeah.
00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so that target matters. the people, but everything flows uphill, right? So, food chain. So if these entrepreneurs were targeting the rogue people who barely had money to begin with, who were just thrown it out because they couldn't, they're not getting paid. So these people that used to pay these people, these people aren't getting as much money. some of these people are creative and pivoting. So some of these people are getting that money. But these up here, you know, they're like having different conversations and pivoting more. So the majority of the shortage is here. The next level is here. The next level is here and so on. So the money and the money is flowing up, the shortage, but it's still there, it's still being generated and it's still being spent, it is the difference of who's targeting whom. Are you targeting people that have money or are you adjusting your offer to make it more available to them? But in addition to that, are you shifting what you're offering and support so that if you reduce your revenue, you're also reducing your burden, right? So maybe I'm still helping you, but I'm not giving you the one-on-one hand holding, because this price point doesn't allow me to do that, but I still want to lift you up and help you. Yeah.
00:15:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that make sense?
00:15:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, that's my feeling about how it's going, because there's still a lot of people just throwing money just going, yeah, no problem.
00:15:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let's go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I've evidenced by the sudden guy reached out to me, he sold his
00:16:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
company after the harmoses and so he wants to start a new funnel in the fertility nation wondering if I can help with that and they said yeah sure uh so you know we're just uh I should need to get back to them too so after we finish this call I need to go back to these people that are hanging loops what do you call it unfinished loops I would be happy to help you create your really clear and don't don't create the potential for scope creep because I don't want to see you be stressed out for your own reasons but for my selfish reasons too because then if you're stressed out then I don't get to play against myself yeah yeah yeah how must you do you mind if we a you You
00:20:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You Back hey, oh my god. She's painting the like she bugs me for food I gave her her food and then she walks away from her nose turned up Yeah, yeah Cuz she wants I put sometimes put a little bit of sliced ham on it, but I'm not gonna do that every single meal for her So she didn't like that. Yeah, she didn't eat it at lunch at two hours ago So I picked up put it back in the fridge with those cuz the wet food and expensive. It's like $4.50 for a little can of this cat food and she goes through a can of day and plus her dry food and so she turns and knows about it and so I put in the fridge and then now she was bugging me bugging me for food and so I put it back down on her when I was making my coffee and she looks at me and walks away.
00:21:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's hilarious. Is it too much cheaper than that?
00:21:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um you know it some of it is special ones on sale um that is Canadian dollars so 450 is probably 350 US or excuse me um but um I have given her tuna sometimes too but I guess with the special product a more holistic brand it has kind of more in it but the problem is she likes chicken flavored and Merlin the burnadoodles are allergic to chicken so if he gets in the cat food that's why he lifted he then gets the runs like the night two nights ago I was up three times during the night because he kept pawing at me go outside so you know it's not nearly as much of the painting you had this morning food.
00:21:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah and then I had to change their dog food um It's always like throwing up or dragging their butts across the ground and there's a lot of stuff outside that they can get into so I don't really know what's what but I was reading how much corn is in all the dog food and how bad it is to digest for any any of us really but so I got some food from Chewy that doesn't have any corn in it and they've been a lot better but yeah I can't see no little fur babies got to take care of them I know I know they are beautiful like oh no she's eating her wet her dry food so she said no to the wet food that's really expensive and the dry food is expensive nowadays too but anyways now she's stomping at that oh my god anyway um yeah so did you see my video that I did on my facebook page today I saw part of it I didn't get to see all of it but I thought that was awesome yeah and who I'm calling out now 50,000 And I'm embedding the seed, right?
00:23:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
yeah, if I come over here, so, yeah, 50k months from different parts, I'm just kind of embedding the seed. So, so, yeah, yep. All right, so I got this going. Let's go. You cool to start on this now or is that.
00:23:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, let's do it. So, I think the fastest way to start would be what do you already know that he wants to do so that what is the existing goal? Actually, that would be that's what I do is I reverse engineer every single time. What is the outcome that is desired? And then I work backwards and think about what has to happen to make that. And then I figure out what is the simplest way to accomplish that and what are the guardrails to make sure that I'm not. called out of it. If there's potentially something that could scope creep, I build that in and say, okay, if this needs to happen, you will pay for this. Maybe I'll manage it. Maybe I'll lead it, whatever. But just to be clear, if this is needed, I'm not doing it.
00:24:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. So he's got a couple outcomes desired. I'll just write them all down and then we can succinctly make it better if you want. So so the first thing is that the overall big outcome is that his avatar of and obviously this isn't going to go in a minute like this of who he wants to become is like a Brooke Castillo.
00:24:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you know Brooke Castillo? No.
00:24:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. She is the owner of owner of the life. Basically he wants to become a high-performance coach like a Tony Robbins Brooke Castillo. Okay. Or Brandon Bouchard, right? owner of life. So he wants to use the real estate RE course as a springboard to other other missions. don't know what you want to call it, but EG, he has a productivity course course. I think he'd love to have a relationship course. This is down the road like he'd like to just help people, right? His offer is called, his name's Grant Mueller.
00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know ever heard of him. He sounds very all over the board.
00:25:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, no, no. This is for long term. No, I could just go into the short term. Why call me? just you know that it's good, but it does help to have the overall thing. Yeah. So, I mean, the initial scope is basically optimizing this funnel. Also, he'd like to get to let me find the actual URL top of that yeah top of heart offer and this is converting not bad it's at 7% conversion so it actually isn't bad um he showed me the conversions but uh top of hearts he booked Bob Berg's written the four that's his friend as well but um you know as far as uh you know if we were just to go down to the real outcomes that he wants to um make a profit with this uh little ticket funnel funnel and that's called top of heart offer make a problem that's um he also said that it'd be he says i can afford the 5k right now no problem but it's coming out of my real estate business but i'd like your 5k month to be funded from this event as well. But basically, I think you'd like to get to 20k profit per month. I need to say an exact number. He kind of just said he wants to make it profitable. So let's just get rid of this.
00:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it currently like, does it lose money?
00:27:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What is that? Yeah, so the history is he hired this other guy, Vinny, to create the funnel like two, three months ago and run ads. And so the deal he had with him is that he charged in 10,000 to build the funnel and doesn't include up so one or upsell two, which is kind of like my little ticket offer. But he also runs ad for it. And because he knew that he had a $3,500 high ticket, he said, when you make your $10,000 back in sales of your high ticket, then I'll charge you $5,000 a month for continuing run ads and optimize the funnel. So Vince, a few weeks ago, decided to stop doing being an agency, um, you stopped everything. And he still likes Vince. He says, a good guy, but I have no one now, right? So the goal is to make it profitable. So he didn't really have the greatest numbers right now. And he was embarrassed about it, but said, I kind of need to know your numbers. He shared screen yesterday into his go ahead level account. That's why I knew he was converting at two at 7%. But no, he's, I don't know if he's profitable. I say no, because his average order value is probably only between seven and $10 because he had zero conversions of his order bump and zero conversions of up cell one. So I said, okay, right there, I know I can help you tremendously. So I already know you're under water because you're probably paying at least $40 cost per purchase. But I didn't want he was going to give me access to account. But I said, no, until we have a working relationship, I don't want to work, like expand my brain energy on that. But I know I can help you.
00:28:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how where is his current lead to coming from?
00:28:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's a new funnel. So paid traffic, Facebook ads.
00:29:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And what's, what's he paying? What's he getting? How many eyeballs are seeing it?
00:29:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, I don't know.
00:29:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I mean. I didn't want to look at his eyes. Okay. Okay.
00:29:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You don't know about it. Yeah. Yeah. Um, basically in the last, like, I think Monty had like 29 buyers. oh, he said he was spending 15, uh, I guess Vinny's deal with he does with people. He was spending 15, uh, $50 a day. And he's been running it for about six weeks. He said, these are all like, what happened, which I thought was kind of . But I'm not going to go into detail, slam, anyone or anything. But, um, because there's always two stories to it. Um, there was a slack channel that Vinny had with his clients that had all these numbers on it. And, uh, Vinny closed the slack account down. So, all that was gone. But still, that's up to him as the entrepreneur that he should have had a Google Sheet that showed weekly ad spend weekly So he also didn't know what he doesn't know, but he really, ideally the outcome is make this profitable, use it as a once he kind of feels he has it dialed in and knows doing like maybe launch other low ticket offers. Right now it's, you know, $7 offer. And he's got a lot of bombs and all that that I'd have to totally redo because they're not working. To a $3,500. I take it. Take it with more coaching. So, so the outcome desired is simply. Yeah, make a profit with the little take a funnel right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that that includes paying for me but I'm not going to say that in the document here. Oh, yeah.
00:30:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
let's do some quick math. which I shouldn't, I mean, basically, 5,000, 100 hours, hold on, let me do that. I thought, no, that's right. So roughly, if we were going to keep your EHR at 500, we'll, we'll make it 250, because 250 is still better than you've been doing, right? if you worked 20 hours a month for roughly five hours a week, that's roughly an hour a day. So that's I'm not saying that that's what you should do. And I don't think that you're necessarily in a situation to do that. I think you can do much better. And I think that even if you spend two hours a day for him every day, which would be 10 hours a week, which would make your effective hourly rate about $50, hold on a second, that's 5 out of 40, $125 an hour. So if you worked two hours a day, every pre-day of the week, your EHR would be about $125 an hour, which is still not bad. And I think that this is a process that you should do on a regular basis, just to kind of have an idea before you say yes, no to anything, whatever.
00:32:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And also it helps create the kind of scope.
00:32:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
in the two hours a day, there's a lot that you could do. There's a lot of research, there's a lot of copywriting, there's reporting time, there's all kinds of things that would go into. One of the things I always do for my clients, which very few people do for them, is I set up something for them and then make them owners. So I used to use base camp. Now I'm using Trello because base camp is more expensive and it's more convoluted than it used to be. And Trello is still very simple. It's just camben boards and I can invite them and then I can make them owner, where you can't do that with base camp. You can't somebody to an admin owner whatever. But that way, because you want to teach them, and this is a gift that you're giving them. to own their reporting, own their data, own their stuff, no matter who they work for. So a lot of people, and this is again kind of my leadership style and what I give to them is I teach them, delegate, don't abdicate, but most people abdicate. They say, they think, I give you my money, this is your responsibility now, no, because they don't care about your business like you do, they don't, you know, all that, anyway. So, so keeping all of these in mind, one of the things I would do is, let's say, and I would write this down, and I can, I can take some bottom notes too, but I would start with one of the things I'm going to do for you is create a project management suite there. So it's going to be a Trello board where we're going to track all of the things that are going to get done, and I'm going to task by everything so that you will be able to see what I'm doing, when it's due, or whatever is doing, if we end up hiring somebody to do something, and you will be be able to see everything that happens as it happens and you'll have a record of it moving forward. So if you want to duplicate this across another one of your products, you'll have the project mapped out that you could find what's usable and duplicated to the next one. So this is an asset I'm creating for you that you'll be able to use again and again. Because now you're value-stacking, right? not like I'm just not just getting you the money that you want. I'm creating assets and value that are going to have compounding benefits for you. But the other part of that is now you've got something that shows your work and keeps people from breathing down your neck. Well yeah but Maria didn't get me the results, I didn't get the sales, I wanted whatever. Okay well you can see Maria strategically went down through the list and your offer still didn't convert. know that because you can't make everything convert well whatever. There's a lot that goes into that. Anyway, so the next thing I would do, but I would have done this before coming into it since your job is conversion, I would have looked at the ads. And I would have looked at the ad account because just even though you know the conversion rate, you don't know how bad or good the ads are. Like if they're really good ads and he's spending $50 a day and can only get that, that's a red flag, that's an issue, that means you're going to have an uphill battle.
00:35:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, because because he doesn't have his funnel done, it's only front end funnel at seven bucks.
00:35:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yes, so that's an additional part, but if you have a hard time getting even front end sales with $50 a day, then that would be a concern that I would have, but if it was a really good ad, I doubt that that's the case, but I would have wanted at least that much information before I said yes for sure, like, at least show me one of your ads, so I know and look at it and go, yeah. There's so much opportunity.
00:36:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, he was willing to put me on the ad account, but I just, and also I've worked with him before.
00:36:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He is good at ads. almost hired him a while ago for a client for ads.
00:36:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like he's, so no, I think the ads are performing because for him to get seven percent conversion on 50 bucks a day on the fact that the funnel doesn't have any conversions on the order and no conversion upsell one. Like to me, there's so much opportunity there and just optimizing the funnel.
00:36:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, if you did one of your calculators and put in two order bumps, like, um, just next level, right? Do you, so you'd have to know what does he have that he could give in between an offer, um, between the seven and the 3500?
00:36:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Is there anything that he sells? Yeah, that's my job to figure out because he does have stuff and he gave me access to his whole drive to look at it. I said, look, we just need to create for you like a 297 product or a thousand dollar product.
00:36:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much did that, would you, have to do.
00:37:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, I don't have to create it, but what I'll do is probably will take me only hour to look at all of his existing assets, because he even said, honestly, Maria, Vinny had me create three bonuses for this similar product. And one of these bonuses, I think, could be the $297 if I just flush it out more. Nice. So yeah, it's kind of like what I did with Crena. Like, Crena had that $20 funnel, $50 average order value working with me. I increased to like $105 or more average order value. And instead of sending people to her $4,800 thing, I said, we just need to create a $1000 product. Oh, you're, she already had it. She already had it. So I said, we just need to create a decent enough sales page for it. Here's your VSL script for it. I outsourced the power graphics for it. And we also created the payment plan or 12 for 99, 12 months, and people stay in several months, and she's going to get 15%.
00:37:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, your most of your work is getting to done in the beginning. One thing I would require is a 90 day contract because you're going to spend most of your time in the beginning and not in that end. And so you kind of get cheated. And that's the thing that I would say is, okay, 5000 a month, this is a target, but it has to be a 90 day. And I would tell him because I'm going to work extra hard in the beginning. And so if you cut me out of because you're going to have to do the research, do the strategy, write the copy, create the ads, do the targeting, manage the ads, tweak the copy and the ads, according to whatever happens, create the nurturing sequence or the ascension or any of any of the follow up sequence. is in order to get people from opt-in to buying and then buying to upsell and so on until they've exhausted all of that. You know you're going to look at his email deliverability because you're not going to want him using email and then you're not touching it. I imagine you would anyway, I can't imagine you're not taking a peek at that and making a suggestion, right? So your mental energy is going there. there's probably going to be some graphics that need to be created in order to support the ad campaign, the landing pages, things like that. And the sequences, now we're talking about automations to an extent. It may be minor and it may be just people consider that part of the job, but it's still your knowledge and expertise.
00:39:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is a lot that's happening.
00:39:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So technically you're doing like three people's jobs. So well, four. So the media buyer, the copywriter, the graphic designer, and the automation expert, those are for roles that if you have a decent team, you're going to have those four roles are going to be different people, and you're doing all of it. So the other thing that you might build in is say, okay, if I get you to X point, then I get a performance bonus. And I will have earned it.
00:40:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Right. I know my friend Kira, and she's this is how she dealt with student McLaren and another gal that she's now running huge ads for the dinner clients for three years. She started out at 2500 a month plus 10% of ads. And now she's at, I think, 3000 month, the 10% of ads, but she makes 30,000 month for me client. because she grew, she's so good at what she does. Actually, I trained her that, um, you know, she, she got them to be able to profitably scale ads.
00:41:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you need to include that in your pedigree. Yeah, I'm in the notes.
00:41:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What's her name? Cara. Sure.
00:41:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She probably wouldn't want she. No, no, you don't have to tell her name. Yeah, I was gonna say her name. No, I don't like telling people's names. I, I'm not going to do that in myself. I'll describe the company because it just feels not good. You know, I don't want people talking about my business. My business is my business and I don't do other people. Um, but, but I want you to tell that story. So Cara, I'm going to put this in a highlight as a task that add that to your thing that you train somebody that does this. Like that's part of your pedigree.
00:41:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, there's a few, Kimmy is the same. She's making a killing and she was my practice for a few years.
00:41:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. but does she do all of these things that you would be doing or does she?
00:41:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, she, she, she, She just does the ads because these people have a team, Stu McClellan has a copywriter, he has a copywriter, but what I could do, I could tell them the graphics design cost is out of scope. I could say I know what I want from the graphic design, but I could say that's out of scope, that the cost of outsourcing graphic design elements. And it's not going to be much, but still, know, it could be 100 to 200, don't you think I figure, right?
00:42:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. It depends on what you need. if you're creating, if you're creating a pretty PDF, that takes a lot more time and energy, even for one of my Filipinos, like I might pay $100 just for that, just for the PDF. But then to get the 3D images and what might be $25. So those parts are not that expensive. But when you, when you are creating a new e-book, the PDF itself targets, it's expensive. So the graphics, not so bad. content that needs to be beautified. That's a little bit more expensive.
00:43:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Beautiful. Yeah, because the book's not really beautified.
00:43:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, but in the presentation matters. Like if I give you a piece of chocolate cake, have I told you this example before? No, tell me.
00:43:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If I give you a brand new company, Tina, I'll talk to you girl.
00:43:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I actually learned this in terms about presenting the gospel.
00:43:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It was funny, but it has universal applications.
00:43:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Presentation matters. So if you see me go cut a slice of a beautiful bakery cake, and I put it on a lovely elegant plate and hand it to you with a fork and a napkin, you know, that's one presentation. Now if I throw it on a paper plate, give it to you with a plastic fork. That's another level, but it feels a little bit different. It feels more elegant when you give it to me with all of that, you know, and it feels special. And but then if you give it to me on a paper plate with a fork, I'm just like, it's delicious, dig in, you know, I'm still here. Now, if you scoop it out with your hand and you put it in my hand, I'm like, I don't think I want it. And if you take tape cake and you throw it on the floor and then you pick it up and give it to me, I'm like, you crazy, go away. Right. it's the same. If you eat it other than the dirty part, it's the same, but how you present it matters. So our content, especially when you're talking about like ADHD, executive dysfunction, and also just depression and anxiety, based on color psychology, we know that colors have energy and they evoke emotion. So if you've just got a plain ugly thing, the emotion, you're not, you're not optimizing the emotion. But if you can create it in colors that create warmth and trust, so like blues and yellows and greens and oranges, that's why. If you look at the biggest brands, almost all of them use blue. Look everywhere. Any kind of thing. There is blue. Google uses it. You go look in your bathroom, go look at the biggest brand names that you buy. There is blue all over them. Because blue is trust. So green is travel, oranges, action, black is luxury, red is luxury also. But anyway, all these kinds of things, yellow is calming, but also trust. blue and yellow are used a lot. Anyway, but then if you like, if you have large chunks of text and it's small text versus the parallax type of design, right, and images. broken up through here so that the eye flows left to right and it's not glorious because or let's say they want to go back to a piece of content and they lost their place for a second and now they got to go through this chunk of text but but that chunk of text they wanted was right next to this particular image and they can find it easy. Most people aren't thinking about this the mental effort that people have to go through to consume their content. Yeah this makes a big impact because how can they be raving fans if they never consumed your stuff. So anyway this is something that again you you can just bring to the mix and you make beautiful images and you do this naturally but most people don't.
00:46:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know it's true whenever I've hired someone to help with graphic design Tina I'm just like oh you really suck at colors.
00:46:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can do this better.
00:46:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah like like like that's what I'd say to people like Sally lover and she's been a client of mine for for 15 years in customer mind. Cara, by the way, too, she was one of my first testimonials 10, 12 years ago. you know, now she's doing rocking, rocking it. yeah, when they put stuff together, I'm just like, oh, that's like, come on, girl, let's fix this up.
00:47:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have so much to bring to the table.
00:47:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry. I know, I know I'm excited about that. So, so, yeah, okay. So, so, so I've got a lot in here. This is a lot of stuff in here. Um, do you want to just want to lock it down?
00:47:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am here for whatever and you can tap me down. I get excited about everything. I'm the same way in Sunday school.
00:47:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So you can just be like, Tino can wait.
00:47:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, should I include the longterm outcome or no, that you said, I do. So, but I break things up and stages. So I'll give the full vision because I want them to see that I can see this and I want to get excited about it. And if I like working with them, I want to stay with them. So I'm going to draw the whole picture out. But I won't scare them with a commitment of, you know, you don't have to we don't have to do all that together. I can start with just this, but I want you to see that this is what I see that we could be working on.
00:48:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, so, so how do I quantify or say the full vision? just said, you know, Brooke is there. So yeah, actually I'm like coach certified by her lover. And I think she scaled too fast, though. And I know she's having some issues. But he said that that's I just love her thought model. I love what she does for people, helping them be better you and stuff. And that's what I eventually want to be in. He has, I noticed in some of this stuff in his book that I started reading, he has talked about high performance like himself. This is his first email that sucks, by the way, but this is the book. And you're right, the, the, the, this is not bad top of heart. I got my attention, I saw that. But he definitely is kind of talking about himself as more of a peak performance person, how to approach your business, save my life. I think I save yours too. We talked about how he almost died because he was a mathematics and a dealer. So I've only read the first quarter of it last night and it was interesting. It did hook me. But yeah, I think he could make this better. This is because I think it was on Amazon. think it's kind of like this because it was a written book as well.
00:49:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, what I would do too and what I want to do with everybody that I work with where I'm any kind of operator is I need to know what the values are but I need to know the overarching value. What is the most important thing? So why does he want to be like Tony Robbins? Does he want to be hero worshiped or does he want to help as many people as he can? Now, he's not going to tell you he wants to be hero worship. Your job is to pay attention then to figure out if he's congruent or not. And here's what you need to understand also if he was a meth addict, he has an addictive personality. Addicted personality means he needs that dopamine hit and he can get that from hero worship. So those are red flags that you have to watch out for is that they need a drug and that can get in the way and that can cause them to sabotage business. So you don't have to fix all that you just need to be aware of it and so but but what you can start with so look at that and you know there's love that he is feeding off the energy that is his drug and it's okay because we all have our stuff but you just you just want to know that you understand why he's all over the but board is because he's chasing dopamine he's chasing his hit. So if you can in managing the business provide the hits. right? Then then he's going to be happy. Whether he can speak it or not, what he needs is to feel feel that that energy coming back to him. So if we could go back to your document?
00:51:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yep. I just lay that down chasing dopamine.
00:51:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:51:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All right. There it is.
00:51:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. So, um, there is like, what did Tony Robbins do before he became Tony Robbins? then the Tony Robbins we know now is not the Tony Robbins we knew 10 years ago, 20 years ago, whatever. Now he's doing stuff with his wife and leading women. And so one of the things you want to do is put things in perspective as to where he has now, where he was five years ago, where he wants to be. And to know that there is a pace that you can influence.
00:51:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
if you try to force it, you're going to break things.
00:51:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So this is why I talk about sustain up growth. And people that are that have addictive personalities, which I would say that I do, but I've worked on that a long time and didn't very conscious of it. So I didn't make me get a crowding it.
00:52:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Was that me too probably as well?
00:52:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:52:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that me?
00:52:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
kind of lost my train of thought. But anyway, it was that they'll sabotage things by if they're not filling what they need to do. So you kind of need to help crowd them. And so chunking things out so full vision is just kind of building out what the process is. So we could say, okay, you're here. Here's where you want to be, you know, Tony Robbins level. So one of the things that I would ask him, which is way beyond the scope of support, but it will help you knock this out of the park. If you want to. Um, would be, what is it about Tony Robbins and Brooke that you specifically want to have? Is there anything about them that you're not interested in having in their business? And I would describe, I would have them describe, you know, what does that day look like? does that, that year look like the year in the life of, um, grants?
00:53:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, Tony, do me ask him that messenger right now?
00:53:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not yet. I'll send you these notes so you can go do that later. Um, so then you could say, all right. Well, we know that we can't get there by the end of this year, but maybe we could get there in the end of five years. But in the meantime, you need this to be profitable. And then you want to build out the next offer and the next offer, right? So, we would say the first, you know, six to nine months, our job is to build out, um, is to optimize. This particular offer and do it so well that when you get to creating the next offer that we've got the system down and we can basically replicate it for your next offer. So you're priming him to and that's in a sum to close. We're going to be working together nine months from now. If you want it, right? And that's not manipulation. It's just what I've noticed after the fact. I always operated like that. And then somebody told me, I like your sons of clothes. I'm like, what? What is that? I didn't know. It wasn't a technique. It was just me being me.
00:54:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was just like, well, of course, like, why would I not think about it that way?
00:54:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So basically six, nine months build out this offer to profits and do it so well, we'll replicate it for other niches you mentioned productivity relationships. Yes, but immediately after you say that, you're going go now, don't think that I mean it's going to take nine months to profit. I mean that we've matured it to the point that we can now replicate it to the next product. So now you break out the timeline for making this profitable. So me knowing you, I think within the next 30 days, you will have mapped out two order bumps, created the sales pages, landing pages, and ads, whatever necessary for those order bumps.
00:55:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
One order bump and then optimize, just because I don't know if go high level has the ability to order bumps.
00:55:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't want to get into technology. Okay. So, yeah, that's a technical language as to how it works, but you know what I mean? think is really what we call it differently. order bump, cell one, there we go, which I always think is not about just dropping the price. Hey, if you didn't like it, that price, here's another one, because that sounds out of integrity. But if you didn't like that, here's a smaller version of it at a lower price. Anyway, so in 30 days, all of that should be mapped out and live. Now, they might balk and think that that's not fast enough. But there's a lot that goes into getting that done correctly. And he's going to have to create more ourselves. So we want to make sure that that happens. 30 to 60 days, then, from day 30 to day 60, is we're observing and potentially, by the way, at the end of 30 days, also having a split test mapped out for headlines or call to action or price, but not all of the above for each of the things that we have going on. So one split test. for every landing page mapped out an on deck for live by the end of 30 days. That's a total agency because everything you're telling me now if I had you five years ago we'd be 50 million a year. I did actually and incredibly fast. It's Arthur Tubman and yeah and and then he ruined it by overselling and pissed me off and I quit and then he got a divorce and yeah and he was also a drug addict. Got it. Recovering. Yeah I do know what I'm doing actually. Yeah I'm scaling agencies but but I also know they're the biggest reason I have most of the guardrails I have is because this is a very difficult model and the clients that you take are make or break because most of them are high pressure and if you get these people who have these arbitrary goals and they're They throw a ton of money at an agency and the agency says yes when they shouldn't have because the client was out of integrity Trying to 10x and it just destroys everybody along the way And yeah, okay, so can we scroll back down when you're when you're ready? Okay, so matter of fact, I have phases mapped out I don't even remember what they are, but I know what I would make and I have all these phases for growing the agency But day 30 to 60 is just monitoring optimization and it's more split testing Split testing the abs again headlines call to action and images Sometimes price point kind of just depends on what's happening but Um The thing about split tests, which I know you know is that you have to have a certain amount of conversions before you can declare a winner, so that requires the amount of volume to be happening. And so people will be like, well, okay, did it win or did it not win? You can't force the declaration of a winning split test until you have volume period, because you want to be confident that you know, and it takes roughly 100 conversions to have some certainty. And that depends on how big the gap is anyway, on the split test. Today 30 to day 60 is optimizing and seeing how it's doing. And it's also getting some customer feedback. And it's filling the holes. So something probably got missed, maybe on an automation level, maybe a pixels not firing, maybe the data is not reporting correctly. But it's fixing anything that got broken during the first phase of 30 days, while we were building something always goes wrong, it needs to be fixed and handled and that takes time.
01:00:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
One thing is that if Karina, that's working really well, mean put this as a post and nothing held back as just value add. The VA, I told her to hire from online jobs.ph, I told her to look at hiring someone with higher IQ because we're service and so this person is not a setter that calls to like, what could call the person was just simply texting and messaging the buyers to, hey, did you get your purchase? I gave you simple process of that, because of that good will or good karma, then those people are more likely to buy other stuff from that map. Then what she also did, because we've been running ads for so long, went back to all the old ads, the actual posts, like within the Facebook ads ID, the actual posts, because she messaged the VA, messaged every single person commenting, hey, just wondering if you're still looking for this did you get value from this did you and then from that that increased like she's making about 10k now a month in sales organically for that for an $800 person and but the reason why we had that asset she's running ads for two years right and so you should put that in 60 in the 60 to 90 days slot so coffee shop millionaire how to click bank penalizes you when you have too high of household and so they got penalized big time and all that I implemented was zendesque and an FAQ section and we dropped it down to less than 2%.
01:01:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
38 reduction in refunds by having good customer support so yours is actually proactive support rather than reactive right and in that went to there's a saying in sports that the best off best defense is a good offense you don't even need a defense, if your offense is so good that you're always on their side of the field and not on yours, right? So what you did was you had a great offense, right? You're going out so hard that you're actually converting them to the next level of sales. There doesn't even come up an issue of customer support.
01:02:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This just happens probably in the same conversation. You don't think we can add an FAQ section like in between day 30 to 60?
01:02:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think you should. I think the whole point of creating this scope is not overdoing it. This is a lot of mental work. They, oh, yeah, they zero to 30. Sorry, 30 to 60. You could be starting to do this. Yes. But you, maybe you have the VA do it. So if you do out of scope of support is outsourced VA, then you delegate the VA to start capturing frequently asked questions. As long as you're not doing it, that's okay.
01:03:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, here, start capturing.
01:03:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, 60 to 90, not 0 to 30, or I mean 30 to 60, 30 to 60 is okay, but not before that. I'd probably have that more at 60 to 90 because we don't want to overwork your brain. There's a lot of data to process in 0 to 30 and 30 to 60. Less than 30 to 60, but now 60 to 90, to me, that's optimization, which FAQs and customer support to me is in the optimization realm, but it could be considered fulfillment. So 60 to 90, I mean 30 to 60, it could be in there. It depends on what you want to do and how zealous you feel about it.
01:03:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was thinking it was my funnel. I would want to start maybe in a section.
01:03:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And I. I like the golden rule methodology of things.
01:04:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If I were doing it, if it was my business, this is what I would do. How about refine?
01:04:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So that is an ongoing process. It should always continue to be refined. And also, what I would be doing in that portion is looking at how do we use AI to improve it?
01:04:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Cool.
01:04:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And as far as you going, any services that you offer, knowing what is AI tools and staying on top of that technology to know what can be used to scrape and automate those questions, and because it has the ability to say, somebody asked this question, and this verbiage is different, but it's pretty much the same question. So I'm going to count that as a number. That didn't exist a few years ago, and it does now, so we could create. Additionally, building in here a chatbot for sales and support, 60 to 90 days, or you know now we're getting into phase two of just kind of optimizing and growing scale.
01:05:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Any eye chatbot?
01:05:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:05:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But that's out of scope of the 5000 month, isn't it?
01:05:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, so that could be the next 90 days. And you could say, now this is above and beyond creating and optimization, but this is optimized in scale. first 90 days is create, establish and grow. And second 90 days could be like grow and optimize, optimize, grow, whatever. And then I don't even know you want to put grip, but the third phase is just maintenance and scale. scaling, which seems like they're not the same thing, but when people neglect maintenance and they focus on scaling, then there's problems.
01:06:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, so we try to, day zero 30 is phase one, optimize and grow?
01:06:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nope, day, phase one is 90 days. So that's why the whole point of the long term view, like we have six to nine months. Six to nine months allows for the three phases. the first phase is just really creation. The second phase is optimization and the third phase is scaling. And the third phase is the third 90 days.
01:06:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, day 90 to like next 90 days. Yeah. Phase two.
01:07:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
01:07:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Is it you just call it optimization or scale?
01:07:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Optimizing and preparation for scale. Prepare for So the first thing that you do is look at, you know, maintaining anything from phase one, anything created in phase one. And then now you're going to look for what are...
01:07:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hold on. Let me just hit pause for second. a comment here, but it's one.
01:07:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll hear you.
01:07:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I got about 20 more minutes. But this is for them.
01:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like what you're we could so many days we'll average I'm excited because I have so much stuff in my brain that I would love to teach and love to get well to use but I won't do it by myself Maria so yeah you're capturing a lot of stuff yeah sorry yeah we can sell this as a consulting kit because everyone wants to start an agency make a current revenue can go high level like this we could totally certified people in this and sell it and we've got the notes from every call okay so phase two is we're maintaining everything that was created in in phase one including the split test process right in the customer support process but most of what phase two is it's continuing to optimize right so understanding our split test results and improving them but the other thing is before we get to scale is where have we left money on the table is there a compliment Mentory or supplementary offer we didn't put out there that we should have that we're getting the feedback from our customers Right so if somebody through the FAQ is in the customer support I said, you know what I have this knowledge this gap this gap in knowledge And it's not being addressed here. How do I get this addressed or? I want more hand-holding. How do I get more hand-holding? or Okay, well you taught me how to do all of these things, but I don't know how to outsource it You're not teaching me how to outsource it. Can you teach me how to outsource? now we create an outsourcing product. So the next 90 days is learning from our customers what we could do better and How do we increase the lifetime value of the customer and but also the average order value? You So, that's it, that's it, that's it, it's just massage everything and make it as good as we can. Phase three is scale and it's, you need to look at the pace of scale and the cost of scale. Is that your mama?
01:10:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Amanda.

I should just cut back. Okay. Tell me about Amanda. Yes, bye. Yeah. Anyway, so I saw you smiling in the earbuds or so. Anyway. Um, so scale is first, you have to create the strategy for scale. Right. So that's a long discussion. That's not a one off conversation. That's not a one off meeting. That's a whole process. And here's why you doing everything in Trello for them is so important, is because you will have kind of an inventory of what it took to get to where you're doing and what it's taking to manage the current business, right? So you know how many people it takes to fulfill, and hopefully by phase two we've learned how to fulfill well what we're currently fulfilling. So if we were to two X thoughts or three or four X that, what would it take in fulfillment and who's running it and who's leaning it and who's managing it? So how much high-level mental power and energy and leadership is that taking? And can we do that with the existing people? Can we two X with our existing team? Can we four X with our existing team if we can, then we just go through that process. Keeping in mind and making sure that our content. I understand that you can't just go, especially with Facebook and I don't know about other platforms, but especially with Facebook, you can't just go double your ad spend and they double you get a lot of the times that backfires you immediately your ad spend and all of a sudden you're losing the leads that you get it makes zero sense, but I've seen it happen repeatedly.
01:12:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I think this one is more look at other profit sources as well.
01:12:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, but that's really to me that was happening in phase two.
01:12:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Phase two, oh, okay, but no, yeah, I mean, maybe, no, no, no, okay, so phase two, we need to profit sources.
01:12:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was thinking about this right complimentary products that were missing, but you're talking about channels.
01:12:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no hidden money. Yeah, I was thinking about complimentary products, but scale here is like expand other marketing channels.
01:12:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, add channels. Okay, got it.
01:12:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I totally agree with that.
01:12:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay. So how can we replicate our marketing across channels? You know what, if we map this out really well, and then we go get Maui or somebody to make this into a beautiful PDF or slideshows, and then you're presenting this to your clients. Oh my gosh, like a pitch deck. Girl, kind of like just close it.
01:13:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah, like, because, you know, ages ago, when I worked as a strategy, chief strategy person for the, we see what's her name, Emily Hirsch. I actually created for her because she just had a document like that. I said, you know, if you want to close more clients, because I learned that from work for the big consulting firms, we need graphics, right? So we would, I'm just showing you, we would make of these kind of sales projection graphics. See that within sense, they send conversions. And then we would make, let's see.
01:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know what I want now. What do you want? I want to work in companies like you with you. All the things that I've been doing. I want you to be the CMO. I want to be the COO. But I just want to have the teams. only want to have one or two meetings a week.
01:14:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Everybody do their stuff.
01:14:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I love using my brain.
01:14:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So I created this on paper and then I hired someone on fiber to put it in digital format. But like, so we could mimic this because it's so beautiful. Mimic this with what you just talked about. Yes. Three phases.
01:14:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, we are magic together.
01:14:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We are. thing is, he's expecting the proposal today, though. So I think I need to give it to him word format, just so he has it because I told him I'd give it to him. And he really wants to know what's out of scope. But I think I have enough from you right now, but I agree.
01:15:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think eventually we make a pitch deck like this That's what this is right.
01:15:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, this is actually the guy that does the guy her Lee So let's use the guy that on the MacGyver show. He's the writer for MacGyver. That's amazing. This guy.
01:15:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah Here's what I think I know you have to go in a few minutes if you close this guy Yes, then and I'm happy to spend any of our time during the week just helping you Mm-hmm. you don't need help But if we can speed it up so that we can get to some of this stuff together then then again I'm always looking out for me. I'll be honest But what I would love then to do is is take what's happening there because so You know how to go make all the money But what you can see is a light outline the operation and it immediately comes out of my brain like it doesn't take any time Next step, next step, next step, I can go hire the people, I can bring them in, train, insert, whatever. But anyway, if we take all of this stuff in our, in whatever free time is available, and now you've got enough money and you'll be okay, then let's go pitch a client or two max. But they got to be doing 50,000, I would rather see them doing 100,000 a month with roughly 40% profit margins, and they want a COO and a CMO who work together, who will take everything top to bottom and execute it. And we put out killer, like we just put out a few skills that show what we do, and we just wait until somebody takes us up on it, because your money's coming in enough, mine's coming in enough, and we'll wait until the perfect match comes in, and then we get to play together and build this, and then get testimonials from that. So it's a slow pace, but it means we're not For you mean or replicate to other nope, so I call it face so face three and beyond The face three and you're kind of always in face three every product or Like I don't know what you would call it offer every Product offer type Once you get to phase three, is no additional phase. That's it's to infinity because that's scale Unless base four would be selling mean exit the business.
01:18:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
mean yes, God, got Well, did you say before like what was initially face three and Replicate based on it's just scaling and until you can't scale anymore or you want to sell and exit So for for this, that's it For one product market offer type whatever that's this is it It's just continuing
01:19:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
no optimization, sell the offer, sell the business, it both they're there, they can be separate because sometimes, you know, you, you can sell something off piece by piece. So, but then, so what I would do beyond this is go, um, uh, so that's step one of getting towards the Brooke business, right? After phase three, step two, so this is not a phase, but this is, this is a step on the mission, right? Um, um, is launch the next product. And I don't know how that fits into her model, because I don't know anything about her.
01:19:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Does she have all these different types of products? Does have now and she has lot of coaches underneath her and stuff, so she has a 25 case certification, but she stopped it all that. I won't go into detail now because I think I'm ready to send this to him because I know he's expecting it. Um, I have to go for massage and
01:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like 20 minutes.
01:20:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
terrible. I know, yeah. So, so, but, um, so in scope, I can just keep us assets. creating for you assets.
01:20:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I really like bullets too.
01:20:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think bullets just help the eyes. My problem is that I don't know Google sheets that well, so you want to do bullets to ads?
01:20:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so it's just line breaks and then highlighting it. What do you mean? Let's do this under assets. Yeah, essentially. I was gonna say, if you could share it, I'll just do it for you real quick. But, um, okay.
01:20:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm happy to help. It is. Copy link.
01:20:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, um, can you do T net profit drivers? That's my main. That's what I'm always in.
01:20:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Either one without profit drivers.
01:20:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll leave them. Actually, I'll leave them both of them, but, okay.
01:21:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then I could also put the link in the chat.
01:21:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's probably fast. Then I'll go do it super quick. Okay. That way it helps with this eyeballs and, um, okay. So where are we at?
01:21:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Uh, right. Then I can see what you're doing too.
01:21:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I. Should be able to work. Okay. if that doesn't work, here's what we do. We just go up here. There.
01:21:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I am. I'm seeing what you're doing. I was just like, screw it. either take it into Canva or hire someone to fix it.
01:21:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. But so that just, and sometimes I will do things like, um, uh, like, I'm not telling you to do this for this one. But anyway, just the little bit of color pop. On things that are really important. Oh, so actually what I would do is do it right here. Oh, shoot.
01:21:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That is not a good color. Sorry.
01:21:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Amazon color. Yeah. It's just, it's. Just a little bit of yeah. Anyway.
01:22:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
01:22:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anything I can do to help energize them immediately and help them focus. And when I'm talking to them, keep them, because everybody's distracted by the phones where you're talking to them, they're looking at all these alerts and notifications or whatever. So if I want them to pay attention to the value I'm bringing and I'm trying to make a sale, or I'm trying to persuade them to say yes and do the thing they need to do, everything I can do to keep their attention focused is for their benefit, but also my clients. I won't drag people. little things to psychologically help them stay focused means that we get there going faster. because I know most entrepreneurs have ADD of some sort or another have focus attention. I'm always trying to be like focus on what I'm having to focus focus. Anyway, I know you got to go.
01:22:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I hope this is helpful. This is really helpful. So, so. the rest of document, though, we didn't finish what's out of scope, though, right?
01:23:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, anything beyond this is out of scope. So, um, like, if you want to write a brand new sales letter, are you doing it? Or are you hiring our copywriter?
01:23:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, well, in the existing funnel of specific upsell one, upsell two, yes, that's in scope.
01:23:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. that's the type of thing I'm thinking. So like you already put graphics out there, a VA is out of scope. So for like following up with customers, that's out of scope. Customer support is out of scope.
01:23:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Hiring and paying a VA. I want to customer support.
01:23:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. would include help desk, FAQs, et cetera. Chatbot, is that in scope of support or out of scope of support?
01:23:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think I can help strategize to chatbot.
01:24:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But actually creating it, I think that someone else should. So chatbot creation and then in parentheses, I will create the strategy. Somebody else must implement or execute, or that's an additional fee. So like, if you want to do it and manage it, even if you outsource it, you need to be paid for that. Yeah, most contracts are not this detailed.
01:24:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know, yeah.
01:24:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then something you might put in parentheses is to improve the beautifying, improve customer content consumption, and execution. Maybe parentheses at the end of it.
01:24:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, or should I just take that out for now? Just graphic design? Yeah, maybe he's really proud of the playbook when I
01:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's awesome.
01:25:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, that's smart.
01:25:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, I'll end up later.
01:25:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oops.
01:25:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like one idea.
01:25:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anything else on a screen?
01:25:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Well, I mean, um, weekends? Yes.
01:25:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, so like I'm not available via text.
01:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not available after this hours unless there's a fire. I always put a fire. So the only thing that, um, a fire is orders are broken and they don't work. But I would still say, um, if you want somebody to fix that type of thing, we have a developer on call.
01:25:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm not your developer. Yeah. Oh, the list is a fire.
01:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In which case you're only available for consulting, not operating or something, whatever.
01:25:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You just say unless there's a fire and then elaborate on a call what that is. Yeah, how about you say weekends? I'm not an electrified balance. So there's fire. That's fine. I think that's, um, I was going to say one more thing that I just thought of. It's important. Oh, cost of the ads.
01:26:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
01:26:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, it's the actual. That's been spent is in your account. On the credit card. I know that's very detailed, but.
01:26:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I should put my half these pink migraine glasses. I should put them over here because they really do help with I string to.
01:26:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would scope would be a brand new low ticket offer. How about that? A brand new low ticket. Well, as that would be an additional.
01:26:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I would say anything outside of what is on this document is out of scope of support.
01:27:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, that's kind of what is on, I would say, what is on this document is out of scope. Oh, sorry.
01:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You like what? What is on this document? What is on the scope of this document? Because then it's kind of like redundant.
01:27:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you think I'm sorry what is on this document? Okay.
01:27:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would make these bullets. And highlight the required 90 day contract. And I would use the brighter yellow for that one, bold bullet. Okay. Thank
01:28:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was going to take out, if you look at the biggest brands, the moans use blue because he uses blue and his branding, but I think we'll just leave it as optimizing the emotions.
01:28:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. going to do this really. What the heck?
01:28:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. I know. don't.
01:28:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's what I hate Google Docs for. Did you copy and paste anything into here?
01:28:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No.
01:28:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's weird. It's not that bad. Okay. Cool. Um, out of scope and then we'll do, you know, there we go up on do, okay.
01:28:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I say contract, but really it's not really contract to say required 90 day commitment.
01:28:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What about? Yeah. There we go. Out of scope. And I would actually make this like, well, that's harsh. Hold on. That's what I'll do. This is. That's. That's. That's. And that.
01:29:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Graphics Designer, as far as telling them what to do, because graphics designer, I'm saying the outsourcing graphic designer.
01:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Graphics creation. Because you'll direct what graphics are needed to be creative and not create them yourself.
01:29:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Director, how's that?
01:29:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
01:29:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Graphics design direction. To increase. I guess I would scope as cost of software is right as well.
01:29:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, for sure.
01:29:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think that sums it up.
01:29:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Awesome. I'm excited for you to have that call. can't wait to hear about it. I'll be like, tell me you got the sale, tell me you got the sale, and you get paid before any other conversations happen paid up front, not after the fact upfront.
01:30:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes, yeah, because it's just the stock and the loan gives in the plan.
01:30:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and yes, and that has lots of value. Okay, so you're amazing. You

Two Mark sweets.
00:00:01 - mark sweet
Yeah, I wasn't sure which one was right. So that's all right.
00:00:10 - mark sweet (3)
I just don't know one. They're just down just to one me.
00:00:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just you. That's OK. I just got up with Fuji this back to back meeting. I'm not used to it. And I'm like, I got to go.
00:00:25 - mark sweet (3)
No, he was asking me a question about multiple company names or a different company name for each day. what we have, if that wasn't really helpful. But his situation is a little different than mine because the tracking by a doctor name, not the only reason we have different companies for different states is more because of our trust account and because each day has different laws where it's a little different for him. So I mean, I'm the whole, it's better. But I don't think it's going to make a big difference.
00:00:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like. like um oh so I got to flip something for him. love when people think one thing about their business and then I'm like oh we go do some math and then you find out it's not that at all so July is actually way profitable way more profitable for him than Q and P.
00:01:18 - mark sweet (3)
Good.
00:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's pretty cool.
00:01:21 - mark sweet (3)
One quick thing from the legal side though just in a facamot, the CUNY practice that's legitimacy to his personal injury stuff.
00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh I'm not telling him he shouldn't do it. Okay. That was a nice like exciting thing for him to know that July was actually like that.
00:01:38 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah yeah good tea faces.
00:01:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh you guys always join on video and Fuji he said that it's more intimidating but like accountability so he's like I like when you're there because like I feel like I've got a I don't know pay attention so I think facial expressions which makes a difference rather than just seeing if on the earth. It's not okay.
00:02:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Great.
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My face is as crazy as my voice. Hi, Dan. What's up?
00:02:10 - mark sweet (3)
Okay.
00:02:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dan Jeep, my new voice.
00:02:15 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
My first, my second call.
00:02:18 - mark sweet (3)
voice hasn't warmed up yet.
00:02:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's my second call and mine has because I already got excited about nerdy numbers. There you go.
00:02:28 - mark sweet (3)
So this convention was interesting, the lawyer one. Everyone is just super, super, super excited about AI.
00:02:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, God, what don't they know that that ship was already sailed for about two years late? The K guys ship already sailed and sank.
00:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:02:49 - mark sweet (3)
What's in heaven and has it?
00:02:51 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
here's what saying, not like it has.
00:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It sounds like how you're talking about it. It's what?
00:02:57 - mark sweet (3)
It's not where it needs to be yet to be. effective. So it's never going to be.
00:03:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's it's it's always going to be about the promise. And say it from the beginning, he who engineers the promise wins. But the adoption rate by, you know, the general public is already on the decline. It only ever really hit 5%. And it's on the decline. So they're like, or this 's not, no one's going to use it. Most people don't even know what it is. They don't even know who the vice president is. And now she's running for president.
00:03:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They still don't know who she is.
00:03:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
She doesn't know. That's fine. And it's like, but, you know, there's the whole strawberry thing that just went around, right? couldn't count the R's and strawberry. It got it. If you ask Chachi B, Chachi Bt4, how many R's are in strawberry? it will tell you to right now. They haven't even fixed it. It's like, you should probably go fix that one. No, it can't do simple things. But that being said, I was talking to this buddy of mine.
00:04:15 - mark sweet (3)
The stuff that we've done that's really interesting is. I like fixed it. Now says the worst draw right contains three R letters.
00:04:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
There you go. It literally didn't work yesterday.
00:04:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, is it for me?
00:04:26 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Really?
00:04:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
00:04:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
See, it's not trustworthy. But if the stuff that we've done that's interesting is giving it the data set. So I think it's called RAG. I think the three letter thing is called RAG. And it's like, you're basically giving it a data set and then using it for its large language modeling against the data set that you trust, that you've said, hey, this is the thing. So it's good at that. And then if you, and if you then have it, you're updating that data set and or you're creating an application with it so that it remembers things and all that good stuff, then you're on another level. Then it can work. But what most people are doing is just like API and into chat, GPT. And it's like, yeah, not great.
00:05:25 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, the training the models were people are missing the huge problem. I agree with you, but it's time consuming and boring.
00:05:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, but most people second communicating and the way to make chat GPT work really well is to give excellent parameters. It's not just the prompting. It's the parameters of the prompting. Here are the boundaries. Also, here is the level of effort that you need to apply. So like if you ask at a basic thing, it puts forth basic effort. If you say, I want you to apply it as though you're this person using this logic, there's parameters, right? Completely different type of output. So like it said, there are two R's and I said try again and instead I apologize, there are three R's. So the other thing is you need to build in a check and balance system. So like I just told Fuji, I said go do your reports. I said, but then, because he's like, I'll use chat GPT do this. I said, okay, but then you need to go validate the data and make sure that what it told you is correct. And you can offer it for formulas and things like that. But the other part is most people aren't building in a check and balance system. I mean, have it in our government and not that it works, but whatever. there are also need to be something and that the problem is, and it's the same problem in every kind of business as people don't delegate. They, the hell is the word? You just give it off to people and you forget about it. My brain, I know this word is driving me nuts. Abdicate, people abdicate. So as soon as there is somebody that they think, can or will or something handle a problem for them. It isn't delegation. They just stop thinking about it. That's how embezzlement happens. That's how a lot of things happen. It's because people advocate, oh, this is my person for this. This is my system for this. It works. But we all know nobody and no thing works the same all the time. Life happens, human error, system error, economical error, whatever. So whatever system they build, there needs to be a quality assurance kind of check and balance system that gets built into it and whatever. It's not just about chat TBT and why I'm going off about all of this, but this is the thing that destroys a lot of businesses and a lot of more people when they get to the point where I can pay to delegate. Case in point, Mark, you haven't done anything bad, but I'm just saying this is the thing. You need to be a aware of in yourself don't how to keep the delegation right like we've had issues with our complaints and missing a statute because yeah so dealing with it yeah yeah delegating is one thing advocating is a thing you can't ever do and it has to be the most critical parts like why we why you resist the non-attorney model because attorneys have liability right and it's not just you owning all the liability you have somebody else in there that's got skin in the game and that's important because that that keeps a layer of protection against you strategically and i agree with that so the one interesting thing that keeps coming up and dandy you probably know more about this than i do is they're having these bots listening in on the calls for tonal shifts and for I guess voice for lack of very term is the person sound happy to add positive for us
00:09:00 - mark sweet (3)
some of these things. And obviously they're trying to pressure their problem like flags the call for a manager or supervisor to listen to it, whether it's a training issue or potentially an upset client or what happened.
00:09:11 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
There's no way it's listening to the tone.
00:09:14 - mark sweet (3)
No way.
00:09:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No disagree with you.
00:09:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure they're saying it. It would have to be a third party. They're not doing it.
00:09:25 - mark sweet (3)
They're using something that's already done it. If anything. Yeah.
00:09:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's probably more based on stop words than tone, right? Because just think the individual aspect of people's voices in general, right? how people speak differently. whether it's like people can't even pick out sarcasm text. People can't pick out sarcasm voice. Top words. Words of frustration. Words of anxiety. Words of that all day long. can see that being more effective than. and then looking for a tone or trying to identify tone. It could be a combination of the two, maybe, but I bet it leans more towards the word itself first.
00:10:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do think it's the word. So right now Chat TBT can tell you the tone of words, text. it does that. don't think it's, and also how much you can pick up sarcasm, especially thick sarcasm. I don't know how good it's at that. But the thing is, if people keep it in perspective, and this is what I think most people won't do, which is actually a benefit to all the other people who are going to be smart, is that you take it as a potential data point to go, like basically a flicker to go say, what's happening over here and go listen to it yourself and go, is this right? than I'm going to go and this is a problem person because Chat TBT keeps saying all their people are angry. angry and maybe it just can't even recognize it right or whatever.
00:11:03 - mark sweet (3)
You be able to figure out something like yelling or screaming.
00:11:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, it's it's going to be in this middleware. They're putting a middleware in place. I don't think that's yeah, I don't think that that's necessarily native to Chad GPT. So, I don't know if it's something else. It is. That's all anyone's using.
00:11:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, we'll see it open AI. That's what Chad GPT is, but it's open AI. it's all it's going to be so interesting, but keeping here's what we're talking We're talking and you're interrupting you.
00:11:45 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That don't track anything.
00:11:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You don't track anything. It's important to keep everything in containers, but that's what to your point of tracking is it's easier to do when they're in containers. Right. Daniel.
00:12:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean, it's just, it's all sizzle, right? It's typical lawyer , right? Those guys are the most easily sold people on Earth.
00:12:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's It's unreal.
00:12:16 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, I'm not very excited by Shawnee Ball. And I have no idea how to implement it, what it actually does in the background.
00:12:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and then they're not going to track it. So it's like, you don't even, if you did it, are attracted to what it is? Oh, yeah.
00:12:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, I'm pretty sure you got to have a lot of that to be an attorney, period, or just collectively coming from somebody that was one of my career choices.
00:12:45 - mark sweet (3)
There are multiple more to do this. Coquitos, one, apparently.
00:12:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
What, Pekker? What?
00:12:52 - mark sweet (3)
a weird name that is.
00:12:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
See you. Yeah, I just thought about it.
00:12:56 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:12:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are you looking at?
00:13:00 - mark sweet (3)
So, could you use a real-time AI system to analyze the live phone calls that take customer sentiment provide agents with live cushion and feedback, uses voice analysis, introvert motion, infuse like stress or enthusiasm. There's the observed.ai, does kind of the same thing.
00:13:16 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I mean, I don't think you need a real time, right? you could just find something that allowed you to download recordicals and mass-analyze those to like help nail a script first, right? Like, you know, they don't need like any or support yet, right? If you got a script that worked and you're like, okay, this script is solid. Now, the only way this script goes sideways is through the execution thereof. Therefore, now layer on something where you know it's not gonna try, it's just gonna sort of try to make them be more successful with the script, but maybe.
00:13:55 - mark sweet (3)
Maybe, I mean, the issue, and I'm sure we're coming up is these larger teams, right? Because if you've got, take, for example, and it's alerting you that Marie is not doing a good job for whatever reason, right? You would want someone to listen to it take it over because you could potentially have a large case, right, your hands. Doctors office was calling in super frustrated. You want to know right away rather than after the fact, after the problem.
00:14:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right, so like, I like the large case, right? But that would be like a word that could be like a stopboard based thing too, right? It's like, hey, if they say UPS truck, 18 wheeler, you know, you're like, oh, those are like, not stop words, but those are like flag words. Uh oh, this could be a commercial, you know, that kind of thing. But that would be the extracted via the script, right? So there's where the script would come into play to then sort of like was Tina was saying, sort of like what I was saying, you're not writing a prompt, you're just making making data available to the prompt, that's the prompt will say, hey, I can use that. Hey, that's something that I'm supposed to be looking for, and then it does its thing.
00:15:11 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, no, I mean, that was one big one. The other big one is, you know, even up does AI demand writing, which I don't know.
00:15:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, that I can see for sure.
00:15:20 - mark sweet (3)
Makes sense.
00:15:21 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
But you would do it, you could do that right now, but it's just a matter of you having a self, I mean, it seems like the, and this is what I literally was doing yesterday because, you know, I'm a loser. But I'm like, okay, I can just have the data in the Google sheet in like a row. And I just say, hey, this row. And I keep telling chat GPT, like, I don't need to build the database at this rate, but I need to someplace to store the data and say you're using this. Then it's a matter of like, you give it a demand. Let's say you get, let's. it's a demand for a dog bite or whatever, whatever it is, it's a car accident.
00:16:06 - mark sweet (3)
That's what we do.
00:16:07 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, do a car accident. But like, give me an example of one where you'd be like, it's a tip, like the setup where like, this is the demand is based on these four or five things. Like, is there a scenario like that?
00:16:24 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. So you're generally going to have liability. Number one, like, how did it happen? Who's that fault?
00:16:31 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay. So you're saying, yeah, injuries and injuries is the part you spend the most amount of time on.
00:16:37 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. Three state specific, which state did it happen in? And four is the rest of the board of plate template, quite frankly, you know, the terms and conditions and kind of the opening and just the boiler plate template.
00:16:51 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. So you have the first one probably has a fault, not a fault, right?
00:16:56 - mark sweet (3)
it just binary or is there a third? No, there's a third. Okay.
00:17:02 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So you, it's one of the three. And then the next one, so the injury would be the most complicated one, right? You'd have to then go through your database that you have, and litify like, Hey, here are all the possible injuries.
00:17:15 - mark sweet (3)
And then you'd have to build like a sort of matrix, which I can totally see with. Hold on. So when I say injuries, it's pulling from the medical workers of that specific client with what they had.
00:17:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Right. So, but you'd say, like, Hey, had an MRI. They had this. had that. So what is the number more based on the treatments than the actual injury? Like, Oh, it was their neck MRI. you build like a matrix and say they had MRI, this, this, this, this. And then maybe, and then the prices or whatever are included. So it's like, if you could dynamically say, Hey, like imagine, filling in a form and you're like, it's, it's not at fault, it's MRI, that, that, that, right, select checkboxes. And then it's whatever, whatever the next one is. So they submit the form, that goes in that then temporarily updates the set of fields. then the prompt go, then it hits the prompt and the prompt set, the prompt is written to say, Hey, you're going to look after it's half fault and you're going look at this and you're going to look at these injuries, then go look at this data set that has the injury pricing or whatever, or you're including that price. You're saying it's MRI 5000, it's this, blah, blah, whatever it is. And then the prompt is just waiting for you to give it those parameters. And then it goes and looks at your ideal demand, let's call it, which there's probably an ideal one, right? then boom, you'll write it and then the quick ideally you would write all this and you'd have a demand that's done well to compare it to. You say, okay, if I feed it this data, does the demand that spit out come out like this? Yes or no?
00:19:09 - mark sweet (3)
you see how to train it, like the ones already being written first, hey, mean, this information, no, here's a better example.
00:19:15 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
There's no way you could train that. Then you just start massaging that prompt in the middle.
00:19:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's like what we were having Fuji work on with his reports is feeding the data and the analytical process as much as possible. But then the other thing is the system for sure that should be built in is human approval.
00:19:42 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, yeah, no, doesn't just get sent out on and so.
00:19:46 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, well, and you could human score it at the end to go, now that's of three or the lawyer scores. Somebody, somebody that you trust their scoring.
00:19:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That right there. Mark's score basically for a while, and then train somebody that scores according to your approval. That's the thing for, okay, so going back to the application conversation and just the pace of the technology and the evolution, the innovation that is available right now is leveraged, all of this is AI stuff is leveraged if it's used right, but all of it has to be something that you learn firsthand, everything has to be. For example, okay, so Dan, the foundation of basis really is numbers tell the whole story, so we need to be able to have the numbers. When it comes to online businesses, most of those numbers come through the website, so the analytics. So he's diving into GA4, which is Google Analytics 4, right? It's a whole new beast. We've been using Google Analytics. I've been using it since 2002, probably. I think it was out. Maybe it wasn't that old. Maybe a few years after that. Let's see, 2008, I was getting into split testing. So anyway, we'll say maybe like 2005, people were already starting to use Google Analytics. And now it's an entirely different kind of thing. It's this whole host of a suite, basically, of things that you used to have to get somewhere else. But Google owns all of it. And because it's so new, even the experts are still just kind of figuring out how to use it. So he has a massive leverage opportunity to be an innovator right now, which is a business owner who understands how to tap into Google Analytics. And so he's doing it. He's been studying it for weeks. From an expert who I know personally and I've met and he that's all he's been doing is this this whole time So he's been going growing with it But Dan can't delegate this to anybody right and If he could it would cost it wouldn't it wouldn't be worth it The only one he could delegate to would be another expert. So for you with the marketing with the with the AI but also The business the culture all of these things coalesce into Something very unique for you specifically and subsequently sweet law, which does have its own Unique identity and culture, but I'm just saying The things that interest you If it's innovative and leverage the more you spend time on that and getting real data Talking with Dan. I'm kind of helpful with these things Sometimes he spends more time in it. But anyway, um, there, there's a lot of opportunity to at least figure out how we can shave a little time here and there. So we've been talking about the path to growth is optimization and leverage. This is it. If you can improve the script through analysis data, right, with AI, if you can improve, and not just the intake script, but the attorney's want to script two for certain types of scenarios so that they can be handling things more consistently. So like Lorenz for Mike or the case managers, actually, basically everybody, certain scripts for certain scenarios, they feel like they could be trained better to handle specific types of people and scenarios. Because they know their job that people handling is not what their best at knowing the law and case handling is what their best at people handling is a necessary part of managing the case well so like we've been talking about call control scripts or just I brought up the phrase a few times but when I brought it up to runs sorry hold on and when he brought it up to his team they all want training I need to tell you this by the way it was the last last week conversation but so using AI to kind of help us find scripts if you are listening somehow to all the calls in sweet law and can identify who handles inside the team already the best types of people like if we were able to and that we're not here yet I don't think with the AI but something to keep in mind about like best case scenario best use cases would be okay who handles um specific death cases who handles any type of thing or any type of person and they could label it by the language that's used um and then say okay this person does a really great job of handling this type of person like Mike with distributions. So what Mike does that Lauren said that stand out is Mike doesn't take it personal and he kind of scapegoats the the law firm he's like my hands are tired I can't this is just the rule like I'm I'm not the one deciding that this is what we're gonna get paid this is policy but for whatever reason the way that he says it diffuses the situation and then he can get the full attorney fees more often than other people without people being odd and so that's a skill right but is there a teachable not not necessarily scripts but maybe a logic so is there a verbal cue of some but he says this, respond this way, and the result is this. This kind of analysis, which you'd have to listen to so many calls to be able to do that, but if we could get to the point where I think we can, probably in the next year or two, AI could do that really well, and you could identify, you read the book switch, right? Do you remember the phrasing, bright spots? Okay, so they are the anomalies where everything is bad and then all of sudden you've got something that's just amazing, and a lot of times it was something that already existed, so it was a resource that you already own. I'll give you the example and I'll throw this in for you Dan. So there was this guy, he had to go to some Asian culture, I don't remember where it was, where the children were malnourished, and he had about six weeks in a very minimal budget and had to overhaul it and improve their nutrition. And he was a college, something that was funded through college and so you know he had to succeed with all these limits but what they did is they calmed all the data and they found out that there was one location where the children were actually doing really really well and so they went down there and they observed their daily life and they noticed that the mothers when they were working in the rice fields that they would take the shrimp that they found in the water and added into the kid's rice and so they were getting protein and so the kids were healthier and that actually was available to everybody else in the culture but it wasn't a practice across that that area I don't even remember where it was I wish I did I read it like 10 years ago anyway so that resource was available to everybody but only one person was using it so they didn't need a new budget they just needed to tell people use what's in front of you put it in the rice give it to your kids they'll be better you may boom right so it already existed so my point is that if we can get better data, even more deeper data stuff that we've never even thought about really looking into, because it was a pain in the and Mark doesn't like pain in the is data. I just had this conversation with the other person like I don't want to do that. Anyway, um, friends go figure. Anyway, um, then we can figure out where are the bright spots in sweet loss. Like, is there something that Samantha does on calls that makes her even better? Um, I think that there's going to be more that we can figure out. And if we can figure out how to safely, ethically reliable, reliably get AI into, listen to these calls and give us some kind of info. That would be, we could really improve and up level all of your existing people. with feedback from what's already happening inside this route. I wore myself out talking too much. But anyway, hopefully that was useful. Dan, you're quiet. Are you in a rabbit hole?
00:29:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, I'm like sitting here going, I think I could build a demand rider right now with high level. I think because you don't need, you don't. So right now we, for the AI bot that closes people into appointments, we've trained it. So it has this massive prompt that it's always referencing, but the prompt is in a document. So that's the data storage example that I was getting earlier. Here, it's just, I don't know if it's a text file. can't remember. But, and then we let it round. And then we massaged it based on the outcome, we said, oh, don't do that, do this, don't do that. So now I'm like, okay, we just sort of mapped out the parameters. Obviously, it's not exactly right, but it's in the neighborhood. There's not that many. So it's like, okay, you had a form and then you, the form had these elements in it. And then you said, you just have someone fill out that form. Again, it's just all going to be about the prompt. So if I fill out that form and I send it to the prompt, what do I get at the output, right? And that's a very, like, we don't need a production ready, passable, blah, blah. What's the point in doing all that if it doesn't work, right? are around the sizzle. Hey, we're going to go build a business around this sizzle. But... If the stake is no good, I don't care how easily it is. And that's, what are the odds, right? That, I mean, I can tell you right now, I'd be willing to bet a lot that none of these companies have a pre-lit lawyer at the helm saying that's a good demand, right? And let's face facts. What do you need at the end? You need a good demand. What's a good demand? The one that gets you more money than the demand, right? They don't even have a comparative, but they don't know good from bad. It's like, well, I met with the absurdly guys and they were telling me, which we need to talk about them later, they had what might be another Arizona firm backed by P.E. Money that they sold a thousand leads to. But let's say their leads are $250 a piece, which they may or may not be. can't remember their present. So they dropped 250. Yeah, they drop this, this firm, whoever they are, drop $250,000. And then they were like to add sardly. How do we know this is working? Come again. You guys don't know what to do. So then the ads are like, well, you know, you're going to want to look at how many you convert to a retainer, like, what is that blah blah blah. is over the course of like two or three months, and then they pulled the plug and they said, okay, we're going to stop and we're going to evaluate and see what the outcome is. Pardon, your outcome is not coming for about six more months.
00:32:41 - mark sweet (3)
FYI.
00:32:42 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
If you're lucky, if you have lawyers. So clearly, nobody in that project was an actual personal injury lawyer, ever worked in a law firm, any idea how these things go. So they just see, oh, sizzle, can have non lawyer. partners. Let's go. Woohoo. Then they would say I stuff, right? So all you really need to do is just, it's all about the prompt. The prompt will be is the ultimate piece of IP. It's not chat TPT.
00:33:15 - mark sweet (3)
Anyone can access that.
00:33:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's the piece in the middle. And having a good demand as an example choose to say these guys even know what a good demand is. And then your point, that demand might need to be financed by state, right? You can't just have a demand demand demand demand demand, right? They're not all the same yet. That's how they position it. And then they just slap this huge price tag on it.
00:33:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
None of the sites have pricing on it, which is always a digital way. If you build anything, that's AI related, Dan, and it is prompt related. What I want you to do is build a dummy test scenario that you run through regularly because my experience is that the output is changing. For example, I have a game that I like to play, and I like to get some photographs, and I have a group, whatever. It's my little, it's my little unwind thing. But I noticed that the output of the group was kind of low, so you help people, so you don't have to buy boosters and upgrades to get through things, and I like to do that, whatever. So I started giving stats, and we went from 200 helps a week to 2,000 to 200 helps a week in a matter of like a few weeks, because they gave people stats. But anyway, I use AI to screenshot all of the players and their rankings and their helps, and it did it really well in the beginning, and now I'm having an issue with the same exact prompt and the same exact data, getting it to give me the same kind of report. So what that alerted me to is that I need to have a test prompt and a test result, right? So if I ask you to do this, I expect a specific type of output. If I give you the same exact prompt every single time, I should get something within 99% of the same kind of output. Because if you're building, let's say, a demand writer, and you give it the parameters, and all of a sudden the algorithm in the background changes. And now, or, and this is what I actually think happened, more, what's the word, the law changes, and they just can find what it can do? If the parameters change in the algorithm, if anything changes in the algorithm, then it would change your output. So, but they're not going to tell you that this happened. Even if they tell you there's changes, whatever. or people are going to pay attention to it. So what I think that you should have, if you have anything that's AI based, is a test that says, you know, if I give you this, you output this, it's the same every time. So make sure that you're still getting the same kind of function.
00:36:14 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Does that make sense? Yeah.
00:36:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Even on private servers that's still having the same issue. Yeah, because you're hooking it, unless you wrote your own AI, if you're hooking into OpenAI through an API, you're still using their stuff. And if the law has changed, which does happen, legislature changes, know, they can't do, what they can't do, how it can be used ethically, whatever, something can change the way it's able to respond to you, then it may change your output. It may say, well, I ethically can't give you that. And maybe the work around is the way you ask the question. maybe you simply can't get it whatsoever, but either way, if you don't have something to test the quality and go, hey, or maybe you find out that the output hasn't improved with your test, like your dummy test, what you call it? Whatever, prompt. back to checks and balances, if you're using AI, there should be a foundational fundamental, this is my test that you can still do what I've been assuming that you're doing and that you're doing it with the same kind of logic so that you know if the logic has improved or just gotten worse or you know the output has changed. I don't think anybody's thinking about that or building that. I'm sure somebody is, but I haven't heard anybody say it yet, so but we have to take that into account because the outputs do change and there's stuff happening in the programming behind the scenes that they're not going to be like, hey, just you know, you know this.
00:38:00 - mark sweet (3)
One of other hard parts of what we do is the medical side of it. And what I mean by that is we've got to bring all these medical workers together and, um, prelet side, we can redact things that are bad, um, and put it in a way that puts our client in less payroll. Like, I don't know how to train a bot to be able to do that.
00:38:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can. I'm sure there's ways of knowing you know, it's not hard. It's fronting. Okay. I could help you with that.
00:38:28 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Like you can. Turn to do what?
00:38:31 - mark sweet (3)
So we'll have, let's say, hospital records, right? We really just want to only provide the best things. I don't want to be hard to where it says like they're on Matt, um, bad for us. And in pre litigation, we don't have to necessarily share all the records. Okay. pre litigation, we don't. And so a large part of why attorneys are doing the demands in my office, because I won't use records to pull out the bad stuff to hide it.
00:38:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
War games screenshot in my head. play a game. But the reason is though, because chat GPT does have some rules about what it can do ethically, but if you put in the parameter, let's play a game, we're going to role play. This is your role. Your role is to share this information, but to make sure that we never insinuate or allude to drug usage or this or this or this or whatever. You lose the game if you reveal x, y, z, whatever, and that logic can work.
00:39:34 - mark sweet (3)
Okay.

Well, again, it's going to be a matter of like having a stop word sort of library, I can't the word, that, you know, you can start it right off the gate, right, heroin, meth, right, like there's something you're going get, but then you're going to miss one, right? But as long as you can then update that. database or however that record exists, then you'll get to it, right? So it's the path to getting to the right version is just iterative beta testing with yourself, right? So you turn, like how many cases do you settle a month?
00:40:21 - mark sweet (3)
don't even know, I don't pay attention to number.
00:40:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay, so you have 80 examples a month, right? you actually use these demands, you could run 80 demands through this thing, and it's going to learn pretty quick, right? It should learn around, I would say 300, you get about 300 in there, and you should have a statistically significant outcome. Now, it's just a matter of doing, right? You do it and look at it and go, yeah, that's good, that's bad, this part's right, this part's wrong. But it's going to learn through actual real world data, god forbid.
00:41:01 - mark sweet (3)
Like you said a rating and like this one's a two out of ten. This one's an eight out of ten. So that way.
00:41:05 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yep. Yep Yeah, exactly and it's you grade it and then give it feedback what was wrong. This is what was wrong Yeah, this is like I talked to Salco about this months ago once once We got through it. was like, oh wait, this could be done. like it can be done. It just you have to do it Yeah, right. I'm I'm sure if you set up one of these services and then run a demand through what comes out You're gonna be like, this is not great And they'll go oh, we're working on it.
00:41:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're working on it.
00:41:40 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
How are you working on it?
00:41:42 - mark sweet (3)
No, that's literally my concern is this just gonna be what they have which is the same as just a template pulled together, right? my own thing then someone else's right because you need to us Then with their every situation where we can make it like a one butt click from ourselves for us or no
00:42:01 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
probably, but that's like the next level, right? Then you have to go right, sales course app version, but the parts that you would you carry over would be the prompt, right? Then you just have to say, Oh, this, this front end. Let's say the front end is just always a form. Oh, this front end form needs to be a whatever their language is called. I forgot what it's going, but it needs to be a blah, blah, form, but then it's still going to go hit any API for charge, even tea, and then it's going to output it inside of the sales force app. And then probably turn into a PDF or whatever.
00:42:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And just a reminder, an encouragement, although I think you get excited enough about the stuff that you don't need it, but the habit that we have of iterations and also just so So you start building something knowing it's not the end product. It's. going to change, you're going to have to do some rework, but it's not really rework because it's iterative, because it's going to have been improved, because you will have learned something that it's then a compounding effect of what you started with and a little bit of a tweak, but in terms of like building something and then hooking it into Salesforce, when you try to have a conversation with somebody ambiguously, like there's no nothing really specific and they're just trying to imagine what that looks like, you're dealing with the limitations of their brain, whereas if you have something that already exists, now you're talking to a coder who deals with API, plus who's familiar with Salesforce and what the options are and whatever, then it becomes much easier conversation because you have a foundation to start with. So if you're willing to put the elbow prison and spend some time trying to figure out a base level framework and get it. started what happens is the same thing that happens every time we've created any type of framework around data or systems or whatever is that you look at it and you're like oh I didn't think about this I didn't think about this and it is a revelatory revelatory process that makes everything else easier but usually what happens is people just think it think it think it think it think I'd like to think the solution you can't you create the solution then the real solution presents itself so you're in the position now of just I mean whether it be something that you use to massively leverage sweet law and I say massively but let's think about it on an energy level and also just kind of alleviating what's tedious or minutia for you and for your people when you have the ability to conserve conserve that energy then all that energy gets to put into higher leverage activity so in and of itself Oh, that is a great play, but then if you create a system that is now kind of proprietary system that you can go sell and monetize, but also not just, you know, coldly because you can go make money, but you also go to get to help your friends use a system. And then you find all of the, you know, related type of activities that it can be used for different types of markets, the dog food like there's. Just using AI to analyze and figure out things. I mean, there's, there's so many plays to it if you're willing to sit there and think and work out the solutions like as much time as Dan is spent in high level. And as much time as you spent just researching and marketing and having all these conversations with different people you put all of that together and. Pretty awesome.
00:45:50 - mark sweet (3)
think. Yeah, no, Dan's super anonymous me almost thought this is all, but if we can actually build the stake behind this is all then we've got something.
00:46:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And even if you only use it for yourself, I have many tools that I've built just for me. I enjoy them daily.
00:46:10 - mark sweet (3)
But as you like to say, Dan, what are the hardest people to sell?
00:46:14 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, no, would be, you know, the best products are the ones that solve your own problem, right? And it's not just you know, it's not just your problem, right? And then then you also have tied to that, the whole story brand aspect of, oh, yeah, no, you know, it's trite to say, build for Laurie's bio borders. But in this scenario, it's not, it's not trite. mean, it's, I don't know if that gets used a lot actually in this space, to be honest, but you know, we get built from, built from marketers by marketers, but it's, it's true. And it's like, you know, you could, then you can go into this whole story brand aspect of it. And also results before and after, before. before demand rider, after demand rider, right? Whether it's saving time, it's an increase, like Salco's convinced that you can increase your bottom line through ruptured, like really dialing in the demands.
00:47:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can increase my bottom line.
00:47:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
that's true, if that's true, let's say that does happen, you're also going to free up time for lawyers, which may or may not have a result, but it's quantifiable, right? These are the these are the cornifiable outcomes of this thing.
00:47:40 - mark sweet (3)
So, we just kind of need to pick A-Link to start with, I guess, for lack of a better term, because there's just so many options for where to go, but demands make the most sense.
00:47:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Organizers get them processed, analyze, start there. So, first, it would be getting files that could be fed,
00:48:00 - mark sweet (3)
to AI first securely there is one other thing that I think actually AI can do very very well and it's already somewhat in our system which is pulling by insurance companies and by adjusting their settlements and what total damages are produced damages are to see who we do better with and who we don't do as well with and see if there's anything between doctors we use and don't use yeah I don't have enough data for everything everything but at least we could tell by insurance company and get it started and it's just feeding more data as things go yeah like State Farm I think that now they are very bad State Farm to State Farm things and they're on there we're going to let you get lot of stuff because we're spending too much money which they go every like three to five years between this yeah that was the interest that uh that thing that Josh showed us is doctor thing and then how I when I when he pulled that up I was like wait a second
00:49:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Like he, he's like, oh, you can use this to find doctors, which I thought was interesting, but then he was also saying that it did that. It should, it allowed you to then look at your outcome per doctor. So you could be like, you know what, this doctor doesn't get as good as this doctor. But then you could go back to that tool and be like, I need a new pain management dude in this area. And then all of a sudden, here's the 20 guys in that area.
00:49:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know if anybody remembers somebody was asking about tracking doctors and creating his spreadsheet for that, just so we can get that data. Bring any bells at all. Oh, yeah.
00:49:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So his thing, his thing does it. I also thought it was interesting. Did you catch this mark? was like, hey, wait, what? So he basically was like saying that your firm's bigger than theirs, right?
00:49:55 - mark sweet (3)
That was the bye I was getting yet.
00:49:57 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Didn't he also say that they refer out three?
00:50:00 - mark sweet (3)
hundred cases a month.
00:50:01 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I was like, wait, what?
00:50:03 - mark sweet (3)
Yes. Now, how many hours, how many are actually like retained or referred out? think are different numbers.
00:50:11 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay, yeah, me too. This was the conversation I had with the ads, certainly guys. Yeah. So oh, yeah, back to that. They gave me all the data on this. We'll just say it was the new Arizona firm. They converted 14% of those leagues. But that's with their version of I'm sure those guys were just retainers, right? They're gold. metric is retainers. It's like, no, the metric is cases. They are different.
00:50:42 - mark sweet (3)
No, I could believe if your criteria is crap, then mine, right? have a great tier. I can believe 14% fairly is because we're at what percent would have certainly like five?
00:50:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's everyone's five.
00:50:57 - mark sweet (3)
Right? Right?
00:50:59 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's like that number comes up all
00:51:00 - mark sweet (3)
time. I don't know how to refer it out as how many 10 10 percent.
00:51:06 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:51:07 - mark sweet (3)
So yeah.
00:51:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. So we need to get so we need to get that in place which we talked about before like there's referred out and then we need we need to differentiate with out for referral and then as been referred out because right now it seems like things are referred out but if you pointed out on those three or four that I sent you you're like I don't think anyone's going to take those however the system says refer it out so I'm like we need to change that.
00:51:34 - mark sweet (3)
Oh yeah absolutely no it's still referred out because again we're going find anything from even from the jobs 50 percent if one out of you know 10 they get some money on but still one more that I wouldn't have any money in.
00:51:47 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well yeah the quick math we did a couple of weeks ago was it's five grand so it's like okay five grand you know nothing especially if it's just a phone call but if you were to go in right now and say refer it out times 5,000, that would be a false number. It's not really that. So, I actually talked to Isaac about that. He's going through the Salesforce course. He's learning some things.
00:52:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, speaking of Josh, what does he have for us in reports right now? You were saying that he could do the...
00:52:20 - mark sweet (3)
We had a really cool meeting that you're going to like, but he needs a little time to put it together.
00:52:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I heard about it. I'm really upset I didn't get to be there.
00:52:27 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Listen, it was I don't meet with him ever. So super, he was like, can we do it Thursday? I was like, uh, okay. But normally it's all email. It's not face to face. Or zoom or anything. And it's actually normally it's email through Stacy.
00:52:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't even email him. No recording.
00:52:52 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I don't get to hear all the smart stuff. You don't.
00:52:56 - mark sweet (3)
I'm sorry. I like the end result of it.
00:52:59 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So that's a good part.
00:53:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like the conversations because then my brain goes, whoa, this is good.
00:53:05 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay, fine. He knows this for sure.
00:53:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but here's the thing. He's the guy who has access to all the data I have been asking for for years.
00:53:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Some of it.
00:53:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:53:19 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
For sure.
00:53:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Either way, it's just I decided to see.
00:53:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, yeah, you have to his thing builds it. So that data doesn't really exist with his add on. It can. So it's like he, he has two apps that he, I guess, sells. don't know. He didn't actually get it. He did not try to sell us on them at all, which was also funny. He just showed to show them to us and he's like, nerding out on them. I like, yeah, but it's kind of interesting. I suppose we could ask him how much the app is.
00:53:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It might be it. Could you do that and ask him to like. I'm gonna tape a demo and let's just hope that he just gets really geeky in there.
00:54:04 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, he will.
00:54:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, he will.
00:54:06 - mark sweet (3)
thinking about this though.
00:54:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Let's see. Oh, yeah.
00:54:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, will you ask for that?
00:54:14 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm already doing it.
00:54:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. Okay. This is gonna be fun. See that and somebody who is excited to go create it and get it for us. I mean, you guys, that's a golden kiss right there. Golden Goose. Okay. Um, uh, down you said you needed to talk about the answer to the guys, but was that what you just talked about? Also, yay for record month.
00:54:45 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, that's good. I was not outrageous. So what was not outrageous? Or spend like we didn't over spend to try to get to that number.
00:54:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What did you spend?
00:54:58 - mark sweet (3)
I don't have the final number. Because they're still adding stuff into the system. So like the very, very rough number. Was. About 420 case spent.
00:55:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And.
00:55:23 - mark sweet (3)
The other week or so we should have the final final numbers, but it looks like it should be around that. Numbers are going to go down and it'll just go up. So it might be, you know, instead of 4,100, 4,250, which is still a lot better than where we were.
00:55:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, would you divide that by incident or people incident. Okay. Okay.
00:55:49 - mark sweet (3)
If I'm trying to sell or from trying to like position myself, I do it obviously by people because it looks better and how 99% of firms look at things. I just don't look at that way from the market. Because again, it's one call, it's not three different calls, right?
00:56:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:56:08 - mark sweet (3)
Um, and they also include their drops and subouts and then try to pull those out as well. Because if we kept those numbers, if we look by person and by drops of outs, then we're at 126, that brings the number down to, you know, 33, which is a significant difference from 4,100.
00:56:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's, I mean, that's really good. Yes. And your subout rate, what we haven't done, which I want to do when we're starting to track it, is just kind of figure out what that percentage is, 8% roughly, right now. But I'm tracking it over time.
00:57:01 - mark sweet (3)
I mean, in this case, it was just, there was one set out where someone signed with three firms in total. Um, I mean, the drops, I put the reasons why all of them in total sense. Um, you know, one, maybe we could have done a better job of the upfront just to try to keep them with their response. If everything else was, you know, a pretty good reason, um, you know, stopping right after a setup. So we need to figure out, is there something better once they sign an agreement to get them to feel better with us? And both those were HQ intakes. So I need to see what we can do to shore that up. I don't know if the HQ intakes do it in Vegas. The guy who runs it's about four, uh, five foot two.
00:57:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not so bad. Hey, that's a good height.
00:57:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
For a guy. Mm hmm.
00:57:51 - mark sweet (3)
who? ball guy with mustache.
00:57:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or Portuguese girl.
00:57:54 - mark sweet (3)
Okay. Okay. Um, because you're coping. Myers is trying to buy all their leads. California, because they have a lead generation business goes with it. They're doing that nationwide, but they're having issues and having to like fire some clients. They like to work with us because we're relatively easy to work with and we get in the answer to the phone. We actually follow up. So. I'm trying to steer away from them saying everything Jacoby is obviously one more. Their cost is 3,500 per retainer. including their cost.
00:58:26 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's not. It's not late.
00:58:27 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:58:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So their lead to they close it themselves. Correct. Oh. Have you seen what? Well, you've gotten it, but it's not. You've already seen what they signed. Right. So what percentage.
00:58:45 - mark sweet (3)
And I see you respond to them.
00:58:47 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:58:48 - mark sweet (3)
It doesn't seem very. I say 10% we say, what did you sign this?
00:58:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Exactly. So I was going to say probably still about 10% right. So they're not. Cucouville as far as signing the wrong stuff.
00:59:05 - mark sweet (3)
Now, can I get the price point? may make sense, but I don't know.
00:59:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, it's going to. Yeah, let's say, yeah, if it puts it up at 4,500, remember, um, could score work.
00:59:18 - mark sweet (3)
Look, in special outcomes.
00:59:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Analyzing as a vendor.
00:59:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:59:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so just will just will have the per vendor. That's what I was going to ask.
00:59:34 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, we're doing per vendor per state, and then we're checking the ROA all the way through to see what our ROI is on each source.
00:59:41 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:59:43 - mark sweet (3)
But then hopefully we also add on per attorney. So we'll see which attorneys doing what.
00:59:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, understand you guys all like want growth and they don't get excited about anything and really celebrate the win. That's a big celebration.
00:59:58 - mark sweet (3)
And then you should celebrate with your whole team and tell them. They're reading large bonuses this month so i'm already um super thrilled about spending more money.
01:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean that's not the only way to celebrate you can just oh i need to schedule another like follow-up meeting with you too. I want to do that.
01:00:16 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah almost sixty two thousand dollars this past month on bonuses which is a lot.
01:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a lot um yeah but you don't have to just use money to thank people.
01:00:30 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah people like money.
01:00:32 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
They do like money but they also like praise.
01:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They do in LA. They also like praise and knowing especially yours.
01:00:41 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah they also like money.
01:00:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh whatever. Okay um so we spend a lot of time talking about the AI stuff just one other Just want to start getting up over one because it's going to take a lot of time to get it right.
01:00:55 - mark sweet (3)
Like it's not this is not okay. By next week we got a process. That'd be cool but. that's not yeah likely um but in every case that we get the policy limit on meaning we get the most amount um circling those to feed because we always want to give chat sheet see the best data although guess we can say hey oh void writing demands like this as well yes you so you want to a high low yeah yeah for sure and it's worth all the effort to organize that data to feed it correctly and then give it the parameters and really have um measure the output based off of the prompt there's there's a lot of leg work to do but then once you do it it goes really fast so um i mean i think that's really it uh is there anything else that we should discuss rather um then try to start any new conversations right now that was a good conversation and especially because
01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we're leverage and optimization, which is really the overarching, you know, target that we have the most out of the least.
01:02:08 - mark sweet (3)
So we can go with Dan, you know, there's more money to be made for Dan and for me, for the separate side projects that are not just the law for themselves. And I want to make Dan and myself lots of extra money.
01:02:20 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So, you know, there you go.
01:02:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll just watch.
01:02:24 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, look, this is the doctor run, right?
01:02:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
doctor notes like I'm down for it. I got lots of time to work.
01:02:32 - mark sweet (3)
So yeah, I want to hire a teen and make her my money too. She's not.
01:02:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, okay. So is there anything that's pressing anything that we should know or just to bring that for an agenda for next week? On either side.
01:02:54 - mark sweet (3)
And this month, I'll be waved into Colorado and to We don't have anybody in Colorado to do it. We have both Fuji and agape.
01:03:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no, I'm an attorney.
01:03:11 - mark sweet (3)
Like you're the only one that we able to do Colorado. Yeah, the same way we do like Washington right now.
01:03:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just saying cuz like somebody's already in New Mexico, but not you.
01:03:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So I'm asking Colorado is open for the Colorado's mark and mark AI.
01:03:26 - mark sweet (3)
Here we go. Yeah, no Colorado is we're trying to. haven't done anything with it yet. Um, although thing of it, the dude who was selling like coaching, he did like a really crappy job with Andy Stickel on the other dude. I don't remember who that is. Anyway, they connected with the guy in Colorado who just does a bunch of billboards, but doesn't want to actually work, and wants to spend all his time in Italy. So, yeah, maybe they'll be in part of connection there, but I don't know.
01:03:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, anything else?
01:04:00 - mark sweet (3)
Talk to Tom and the CAMG people about potentially doing boards into Mexico because that may not be the worst place to start and start getting like our message a little bit clearer and our feet under us to some level. That's just one thing we really haven't done much of any on is, you know, traditional.
01:04:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I would love to see the valiant breakdown by state.
01:04:31 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, it was actually kind of interesting. No Washington, despite generating a decent number of Washington leads in no California.
01:04:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, how much of New Mexico was him.
01:04:49 - mark sweet (3)
I'll tell you right now because he had asked him the same thing and to do the breakdown form. So that was for Missouri, five New Mexico for Washington. Sorry, no Arizona, that was not Washington, Arizona, that was weird.
01:05:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or Missouri, what?
01:05:10 - mark sweet (3)
Or Missouri, five New Mexico, Washington. But he generated a decent number of Arizona leads, just not an abandoned anything.
01:05:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where do the rest of the New Mexico ones come from?
01:05:26 - mark sweet (3)
Three came from Quantify. One came from Felipe, one came from Monkey, five from Valiant, three from Walker.
01:05:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was just asking because for the longest time in Mexico was averaging like two, and then we jumped up all of a sudden, just a few months ago to six, and now we've got thirteen. I mean, those retainers, that that trajectory is impressive.
01:05:56 - mark sweet (3)
It's quantifying Valiant, those are the two that really made the difference.
01:06:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
before quantifies Ben and quite frankly pretty good find thanks for mustache guy yeah like I said he never know so we're like him sort mustache guy yeah that's a case HQ but who found them case HQ on case HQ no case HQ came from case connect guys yeah and then case HQ referred quantified and who did case connection guys come from me that was the pedigree before it was me yes okay okay it was me for being on Facebook sort of case Nick was an absolute monetary failure for us that's okay they saw
01:07:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you have to look at the pedigree, you have to look at the little chart there, it matters, cause and effects, everything.
01:07:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, I mean, that is good point, right? It's like, some, right, it's not a fail, it wasn't a, it was a lesson, right? wasn't a failure in one respect, but then it's like led to this and led to this.
01:07:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It had a return, even if the return was indirect.
01:07:25 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, and then other people won't do it, right? That's like, that's what the ads are dealing with right now. All these firms they call, they're like, please stop calling me.
01:07:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, yeah, I'll bet. Also, this goes into the practice, which we intentionally and purposely have, which is exploring all the vendors. right. Yeah, exactly. that they're going to be crap and knowing that even if they are crap, sometimes there's a tangent that is valuable to us and, but look at, I mean, record number, When we started your low 30s, mid 30s, and now you're here, and one of the practices is exploring all the vendors, having all the conversations, and it is tedious, and it is risky, and some of them don't pan out. But because of the relationships in those conversations, and the secondary and tertiary conversations that happen as a result of the first one, look at where you're at now, all these different sources, just the change in power and who's bringing what across the state, it's just, I just want to pay attention to the practices and the value of that, because it's important.
01:08:43 - mark sweet (3)
So monkeys back to where it shouldn't be, because they did concerned over last month, obviously, because the numbers didn't make sense.
01:08:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Also, I feel like you leave You you manage the vendors better. I feel like you were a little bit more reactive before you didn't know your numbers, you weren't on top of them and you were hesitant to want to have conversations with them. I think you felt like they had a little bit more power over you than the other way around the dynamic has shifted and all of that has happened mostly. Here's the thing. The other thing about data that people don't really notice is that it creates a level of confidence in you know what you know. And so you do what you do even better, and that adds to more confidence and it's a compounding effect too but when you negotiate with people confidently their outcome is very different. So, anyway, all of that just takes into account. So, just wanted to point it out.
01:09:52 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, I just got to repeat it and beat it. think we're tenors out for next month already so that's good.
01:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good September. I can.
01:10:00 - mark sweet (3)
That's all right. Yeah. Well, I dropped for it. That's fine. So we'll repeat it again, which is good. And then starting soon, have Yuri. He's a lot of Thark joining us. So he's a Ukrainian Lot Thark dude and he's going to be taking the bar in February.
01:10:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And where's he going to fit?
01:10:23 - mark sweet (3)
So when he starts, we just have him do demands because I think it's going to start getting too busy. can do more as a demands. A lot of us quit with his to help Lorenz. He has a very large support system, but we're trying to see if can create another Patrick for lack of a better term where hey, this is kind of good. And you know, short term rental, I guess is the best way to think about it. You get a chance to see the lawyer be it be like in baseball, right? like, oh, it's a mid season pick up, but then like they're down the end of the season. We like to do not like anything. And so if he's a great film another Patrick, he's not great. We'll just say, hey, know, our perfect time done.
01:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Goodbye. I love that.
01:11:02 - mark sweet (3)
I love that as a problem process to build them up. this is a long term commitment, but but it's not with no without anything because he's doing some work.
01:11:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and it's the and also that's easier than going out and just trying to hire anybody because that doesn't go well.
01:11:23 - mark sweet (3)
We're having much more difficult time with it. So it makes more sense to build these people internally or I'll do both quite frankly, where we can find them. We just have to keep an eye on our payroll because that's a lot.
01:11:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is the guy who just like keeps throwing out bonus and left and right.
01:11:40 - mark sweet (3)
That's Mary more than me, but yeah.
01:11:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, okay. Well, Mary.
01:11:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think we need to start having some other conversations.
01:11:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Mary's nickname is money fairy.
01:11:51 - mark sweet (3)
Maybe you didn't know this. Look, we started. That's what I was going to say. You know, if the teams have their goals. to help them do more than push them and do more. So, you know, hey, and those are high numbers. think maybe.
01:12:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
But here's the question. Here's the real question. Are these numbers a result of that or not? Because you're for sure related. But right.
01:12:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
to what degree?
01:12:26 - mark sweet (3)
Right. I think what's going to be more on the money in than on the settlements themselves because the teams while they do have some controller getting, you know, records and whatnot. I'm sure they feel more like the attorneys are responsible for that. On the money in, you know, maybe something like the teams like the case manager is sitting around like, how close are we, how close are we to see what else they can push to try to get that extra money in.
01:12:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's the thing though. It's the amount that will make the biggest impact to you that actually almost makes the least impact to them. So psychologically. If there is a bonus for a thing, it's not necessarily that that bonus has to be a certain number. It just has to be there There's a potential that you're overpaying. So like on the line item for how you can earn the money Taking that back not necessarily you can't take anything back. Anyway, this is a whole big long conversation But my point is is that a lot of times a five dollar Not talking about your attorney your your your attorneys your team But it's somebody just getting an unexpected or an earned extra a small amount Versus a large amount that the happiness level is almost equal. They're obviously our gaps, right? But my point is that To get the lift that you need you probably don't have to give the lifts that you're giving so There is some math to be figured out there, but again you have an existing team Zisting expectations pulling back and then you have have to look at what's available in the market. There's a lot of numbers to crunch.
01:14:04 - mark sweet (3)
And that's probably what it comes to the market, where we can do these interviews, what people want, is more than what we're paying our current people for lower quality.
01:14:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:14:14 - mark sweet (3)
So this is the way to bridge that gap to some level.
01:14:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's entirely possible that it's a very, very good system. And so then the other way to leverage your money is to be able to use things like the AI to have them doing less of the tedious stuff. So they're doing more of the money-making activities. So with the same amount of staff, you're getting more money. You're also paying more bonuses. But that still should be maybe it's not a higher percentage of profit margins, but an overall higher bottom line. Then you're still winning the game.
01:14:51 - mark sweet (3)
So I think that's issue for me. is that I wanted an achievable because I hated, hated, hated working for people where the goal is just not realistic.
01:15:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. You feel like you're being set up to fail?
01:15:09 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. But I think it may actually be a little low because I shouldn't be breaking even every month if they hit their goal.
01:15:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Like that's not right.
01:15:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Exactly. So what kind of How can we visually see this data of what comes in and I have to think about, you know, what I would want to see, but all the different types of bonuses, what all the goals are, who hits them, how they hit them, what it costs you, aside from the bonuses is, you know, the working net revenue up until payroll and bonuses so that we can see that correlation and and look at the performance over time.
01:16:03 - mark sweet (3)
I can't, I'm kind of fried right now, but the most person they got and go through, but you know, again, these are good problems to have right in their goals and in their expectations.
01:16:13 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That's definitely not a bad thing. Oh, I got something. I talked to your boy, Salco. I forget when, but I forget when, but because I didn't answer the phone for a couple days, because I was doing a bunch of with my parents, but uh, so he was saying, and I thought this was interesting because I was like, okay, yeah, I never thought about that. He was saying how he just settled a dog bite through you or whatever, in your, in your firm, I think, for like 75 grand. He's like, yeah, just settled a dog bite for 75 grand. And I was like, okay. And he's like, can any of these vendors generate dog bite leads? And I was like, I don't know, like I never, I've never done it. I've never asked them. I've also never seen it. So I, when I I was talking to Ed, certainly, on my bi-weekly call that I have with them, for whatever reason. I brought it up with them, and the guy was like, really? I go, And he goes, I've never seen anybody do that. go, neither have I. So then he starts researching. He goes, dude, there's nine million dog mike. And he just starts rattling off all the data. And I go, And he's like, why doesn't anybody do this? go, I don't know. I go because lawyers, copy lawyers, copy lawyers. And I go, do you think you could generate them? He goes, yeah. And so when I was talking to South, I go, what's the criteria? And he goes, I mean, you know, that route lost some . And what I heard was, did you get bit a dog? Do you know who the homeowner is? Did you get medical assistance? Medical treatment. That's it. That's it. That's a lead. So I was like, yeah, that would be a lead. Oh, okay. That's a simple form, right? They just fill that out. So then it just becomes a math problem. What's the cost per lead? So if you say, cost per unit is x, convergent is five, right? We always know it's five from internet, basically. Then, and then average case value, you might not have enough data for that. But I go, okay, that's interesting. Like you could do that, but now you're talking about diversifying your case load, right? So everyone's going out to car accidents. You add this into the mix. got it. Now, hold on. You got car accidents and dog bites. Then you're also adding into the mix. Well, now they've had a lawyer with suite law. And when they get, when they get in a car accident, they're going to call a suite. Yep, and the referrals. So now all of sudden you're adding new nodes to your network. I was like, okay, that's interesting. And then it's a different demand, right? So it's like, okay, do you have a good dog bite demand? Sounds like Salko maybe had a good one. have no idea. But I was like, okay, that's interesting. And these guys were like, I can't find one. ad for this. That's it. I can't explain it to you, but I've never done it. Doesn't mean you should.
01:19:07 - mark sweet (3)
One really big difference between a couple between dog biting car accident.
01:19:12 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:19:13 - mark sweet (3)
The drop rate is massively higher on dog bite because a lot of people don't have insurance.
01:19:21 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. Exactly. So the qualifier, so the 5% might be too in actuality, right?
01:19:29 - mark sweet (3)
So if you if you bake it in a 50% drop rate, you get into the case because that's what I'm saying. So your drop rate is 40% plus.
01:19:38 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So if you model it at 50, can you even model it out, right? So if you say, okay, going to get, you're going to get, it's $250 a lead, you're going to convert five, and then, and then half of those are going to drop. They probably going to be cheaper, right? Yeah. So I was like, all right. And so the ads certainly guys are looking at it. They're like, wait. this is a thing. I go, it is a thing. I just don't know if it's a thing that works. And they're like, all right, this is interesting.
01:20:10 - mark sweet (3)
And of course, for them, talk about you get decent money on, especially when you talk about minor children getting bit, like we've gotten.
01:20:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That's the other thing, it's mostly children that get bit just to do sports a lot. No, according to the stats, I don't know if it's truly true.
01:20:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We have a little girl that lives up the street. She got mauled so bad. She doesn't have hair anymore because they she got attacked by two governments and they they chewed up her scout like she shouldn't be alive. She had multiple surgeries.
01:20:43 - mark sweet (3)
It was right. And so if there's insurance on the homeowner, that's, you know, $500 million case.
01:20:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yep.
01:20:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
01:20:52 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
They got nothing. So those get so you're not totally against this idea, then?
01:20:57 - mark sweet (3)
I'm not totally against the idea because be significantly cheaper for a commitment.
01:21:03 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I would imagine.
01:21:04 - mark sweet (3)
So yeah, exactly. But I'm not against the idea because the criteria is, did you get that yes, and then get scarring photos, basically, would like show me the bite because you've got people that it's like, you know, a scratch, like it's what I got. Oh, there you go.
01:21:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:21:18 - mark sweet (3)
But dog bites, especially California, it's there's no one bike for you. think Arizona law is a little different.
01:21:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Did you just say one bite free?
01:21:27 - mark sweet (3)
So Arizona kind of has that role, actually.
01:21:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
You're kidding. You had to have to be a second offense, like second strike.
01:21:35 - mark sweet (3)
Unless, you know, a dog with dangerous propensity. Yeah. wow.
01:21:40 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. And they were like, we could do California. OK, that would actually be the perfect and biggest population, all that good stuff, man.
01:21:49 - mark sweet (3)
Because you got some plastic assertions and stuff like that.
01:21:51 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So California would definitely be.
01:21:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. yeah.
01:21:55 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
01:21:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah. Well, I think the other thing is the system, whatever system. some you create like a could do you have access to or would a private investigator or if you hire them have access to like if you get they say yes I know the homeowner this is where they live this is their information where they could go say we know that they have insurance is it a record that a specific entity would have access to no you can hire a investigation companies it just but they're not the best in that regard I mean you send letters the worst case you file lawsuit and discover you find out pretty quickly and you just learn they have nothing and it's kind of a whatever but so if you wrote it all up it's basically here's the boxes this is what has to happen this is this is how long this would take this is what this process would look like so that and then do a rough forecasted like if we were able to get leads at this cost the percentage that have insurance, don't have insurance, the estimated value like I just did a quick search and it says 4.5 million people have been a Forbes report for last year, per year, 800,000 only must seek medical attention of those. Do they know, you know, how much is that is just little stitches or go away? There's nothing like there's so much data to go get and then plug in those numbers and then how much does it take? But even if it added, you know, $50,000,,000 to your gross revenue, that revenue, whatever, all those numbers, you could spend a day or two doing the research and find out if it's even viable, but if it's viable and you've got...
01:23:45 - mark sweet (3)
It's It's viable. Generally, also need to try to target more affluent areas.
01:23:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You don't want to target like combat. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:23:54 - mark sweet (3)
That's the big difference for the lead generation.
01:23:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They usually just do state wide and if you live or die by it's an area.
01:24:00 - mark sweet (3)
is where you just, you know, damn well, they don't have anything.
01:24:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:24:04 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So you're not targeting Compton. I got you're in Compton.
01:24:07 - mark sweet (3)
You're going to target more like Vermont.
01:24:09 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:24:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, okay. Um, else that needs to be talked about this week or tabled for brought up for next week to talk about?
01:24:23 - mark sweet (3)
You know, I mean, I buy things definitely in Avenue. Um, because it's easy to train. like, did you get bit by dog? Yes. Okay. You theoretically have a case like it's not.
01:24:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's also it's another way that you're using your existing resources. So it's getting more out of what you have. And that is leverage. Yeah. That's what we want more of that. Okay.
01:24:46 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. That's a back then.
01:24:55 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
But yeah. Oh, yeah.
01:24:57 - mark sweet (3)
I know. Yeah. That's coming. Yeah. Just as a quick heads up. that's one word for it.
01:25:05 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Um, but yeah, he died when, like today. Yeah. Yeah. That's what him and I were talking about that. He's like, he was like, I don't understand like what he thinks is going on. Like he's kept saying his dad thinks he's going to be doing this and doing that. I was like, dude, nobody, nobody, like, we're all on the same path. We're all on a path to the end. Of course, we're not sitting there going hope it ends.
01:25:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My mom is.
01:25:39 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, is true. And they and they accelerate that for them.
01:25:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know.
01:25:47 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, not recommended.
01:25:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not recommended. They're miserable. And they spread them as a read.
01:25:54 - mark sweet (3)
But you had something. All right. We're situation.
01:25:59 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, for sure.
01:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right guys, till next week.

I'm going to do on my phone because I can't find the other link.
00:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was just emailing it to you because I sent that to both of you, sorry, yeah.
00:00:23 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Let me just change the settings so I can use the camera.
00:00:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, you don't have to, we can still talk, let's just look, there you go. Here we go. Hello. Hi, sorry.
00:00:46 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
I'm having issues every week.
00:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, as long as you don't get frustrated by it, I don't get frustrated by it, it just is what it is, but anyway, sorry, thank you for rolling with it. It's a cool, calm and collected. It's good, baby. How are you, Ben?
00:01:06 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Good.
00:01:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah?
00:01:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Brining away.
00:01:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Grinding away.
00:01:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
00:01:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That business. You do have some fun though, right?
00:01:18 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah, I don't know, weekends. mean, every time I go to the gym, I'm like happy, you know?
00:01:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, you get that oxytocin when you lift heavy weights?
00:01:28 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
I'm sure that, but I did not know that.
00:01:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I just learned that this year and I was like, that makes sense because I'm happiest when I'm like, for it. I'm also aggressive, so that might have a little something to do with it, but I'm just going to say it's about the opposite of it. Some good chemicals. So the size of last week, I'm a scare little AI. It was funny, actually we were comparing, it's not funny, but we were comparing AI notes and how badly it summarizes things or names people or whatever and it's a nightmare, but I've never had anything as bad as somebody being afraid of losing their job. So that was not fun last week. I was thinking about it makes me sick to myself. Okay, anyway, so let's start with just kind of what, where has your mind been besides, so I'm going to preempt this with when you're a grinder and you're operating, know, you just tackle stuff and knock it out. And operational mode is just operational mode. When I talk to you, when I ask you, like, what have you been thinking about this week? I want to know about the higher level thoughts, the ponderings, the things that you think, oh, you know,
00:03:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
a wonder if we try this or just kind of things you caught yourself observing about maybe processes or just just the business in general what you notice is good what you notice might be better things like that you find yourself contemplating from time to time just like oh one way or the other oh yeah lately it's been like how can I I make things move a little bit faster because I know Sam she told me how she plans like her months and it's like you know at the beginning of this month she's already getting ready for the next whereas I've been more like starting this month like let's get this month you know a good month this month but I'm trying to do it like a month ahead meaning if I could send a demand out as soon as possible this month then I can prepare for it to get done towards the end of this month, early next month, whereas right now, it's more like, you know, once it comes to me that I'm like, okay, I'll send it now. I'm just trying to be in control of how the months will end up as much as possible. So I mean, I've been going through the cases seeing like what I'm able to get started now that way. know, when next month comes around, I have a good idea. Okay, this one's going to settle. We'll be able to get this client as money next month. So more like efficiency as opposed to just, you know, grinding it out day by day.
00:04:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Exactly. So that's what we've been talking about though. And I would love to know talking about is, so what are the priorities? priorities and the priorities for the day will be relative to what's coming down the pipeline, right? And ranking by different types of things. So first of all, if you've got a customer or a client, what you guys call them clients? is impatient and there's a risk of sub-out that automatically needs to be high priority, right? And if it's, so one of the things that you should do, I know we talked about a list of some things, but and I can send this to you, hold on, I'm trying to think about the best way to do it to make sure that we get it captured, but one of the things that you could do is have kind of a ranking document for yourself and for your team. So basically, You look at, you know, let's, let's figure this out. So when you start your day, how do you guys decide what's to work on?
00:06:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Me or the team?
00:06:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Both, because the team is you also.
00:06:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
What I always look through emails really quickly, that's like my kind of gauge of what to do if there's like an upset client email, which we got yesterday, like I see it, and I'll handle that right away. If I see that distribution came in, I'll send that out to the client right away that way. You know, by the end of the day, hopefully it's done and signed and we can get that done. The subtleness that came in, it goes out of the way, and then I'll go through my case list and see what's, what's ready to be closed, what I can send out. I'll And then once I kind of go through that, then I go back into my email and kind of read through like what documents came in that are going to help push cases forward, negotiating things like that.
00:07:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so I'm going to go hang out with a friend. So, this is me trying to think about like years' worth of systems and figuring out the smallest thing to say, but okay, so one of the things that we talked about doing, that is very tedious and people don't like doing is time tracking for two weeks. And it's not about micromanagement but it's about having a clearer understanding about where your time goes. So you have a lot of different types of tasks and there's a lot of mental shifting that happens throughout the day. We will choose our tasks for different reasons at different times. Sometimes it will be mood. Sometimes it will be it's just in our face and we don't have to think about anything else. So we do that. Sometimes it's because somebody else decided it was urgent by their attitude, their tone, whatever.
00:08:44 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
It could be your team. It could be the client. It could be your team because of the client, right?
00:08:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Brought it to your table. But that's reactive and what we want to do now. we're human beings so some things will be reactive. So like if a fire happens you're reacting to the fire but if you don't react to the fire what happens it's a big problem right so sometimes you have to be reactive but we want to plan for and create the ideal environment and system and routine that first of all prevents fires as much as possible. Second of all ensures the fastest recovery when you get derailed because the fire came and you had to deal with something that took a lot of time took a lot of energy took a lot of resources with the team whatever that type of thing. So understanding and segmenting your day and your week based off of types of tasks based off of priorities knowing that everything does have to get done and then also based off of your rhythm. So certain types of tasks are better done at certain times a day. Now there's a kind of a standard circadian rhythm to that. It doesn't apply to everybody. So for instance, statistically most people do better at higher cognitive function tasks like math earlier in the day. And anything passed like lunchtime one o'clock to a clock, that would be better for like task work, grunt work, where you're not having to be strategic, not having to calculate, you know what I mean? So those types of tasks. So what would be a really good exercise, which is not going to be a one and done kind of thing. Everything you do is going to be iterative. I'm just going to keep repeating that and improvement. But is really looking at what what are your types of tasks? What is the mental load of them? What is the you know social load of it? Because obviously if you're in a place where you just want to deal with people less at times a day, right? There'll be sometimes we want to deal with people face to face less or on the phone less or whatever. You want to be able to kind of plan those times for that time of the day. But what should be fluid is knowing that because we're human different things will happen. Those moods will up and flow. They won't always be at the same time every day. So knowing and just kind of checking in with yourself, okay, like my brain's on fire right now. What's the highest level thing I can do with this? Like everything's calculating. I got a savant thing like beautiful mind going on right now. Where can I apply that? That's going to be the best thing to do, right? And that's planning, strategy, it may be trying to figure out a problem for a client that needs to be solved. That's really a good planning strategy leading type thing. And then when you're in a mood where you're just like, I don't want to deal with anything, I can just panel paperwork, but that's about it. So you want to kind of plan a schedule throughout the day that is your norm, right? And when you recognize like you're just not at the ideal place for this thing, rather than grinding, you want to go through your types of tasks and look at it and go, you know what, I'm better suited for this type of thing. Now, sometimes that's not going to work. You may have like a few bad days altogether. We won't necessarily call them bad days, but the energy shift is different. What you can do is different, it may have nothing to do with you. may be the cases that have come through. It could be people, know, whatever the whole... No crazy retrograde thing like sometimes people just lose their mind collectively at the same time, you know, and like you got to you got to deal with that whatever is causing it there's definitely a vibe shift that tends to be like around so if you also take that kind of stuff into account and just look at it so what are the types of things so what I would love to do is kind of create a list together and maybe we create it as a spreadsheet and I'll start it and then we'll just like screen share and look at it and talk a little bit about requirements from you like what does it take out of you can you like knock it out no time no matter what the awesome at it can some of these be a little bit taxing you know when you're having to make calls our distributions taxing any of that type of stuff. So let's kind of categorize the activities that you have to do and then Bob. part of what we think you spend time on, you don't have to do the time tracking. It's always been, every time I've had somebody be willing to do it, revelatory for them. In that generally, they spend more time doing a thing than they think that they do. And that tends to be helpful because then we figure out, oh, that's the thing that we could improve the process on. We could get more training on or delegate to somebody who's a rock star at that type of thing. So, again, it's never about micromanaging. It's about getting information. So, how do you feel about going through and just kind of talking about the tasks that you have throughout the week, of ranking them in terms of value to the business, ranking them in terms of how much it has to be. Patrick, that does it versus somebody else on the team. And then kind of putting the, maybe the energy or the mental resources. that is higher priority. And we're talking super ambiguous now. So once we get the spreadsheets started and we start kind of putting things into containers, then it gets more specific, then it gets more clear, then the value starts to come out. But I'm talking about let's just create spreadsheet. Right now, screen share, do this together as an activity and see what we see.
00:16:25 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Okay.
00:16:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. So let me go. Go sheet. I'm sure. I don't want to make it only to me, you're not behaving or being slow, that's the problem. I am not in the mood for waiting for things, I normally have blazing fast and it's going to be like lagging on me. Okay, Patrick, if I share with you at SweetLaw, is that Google account that you can get to Google Docs or do you need to have a Gmail account?
00:17:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
And now you rejoin the Zoom on the computer? Yeah. Okay, might be easier.
00:17:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm-hmm.
00:17:47 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Okay.
00:18:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, so if I want to share a Google Sheet with you, what email should I use?
00:18:15 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Don't Patrick at sweetlaw.com.
00:18:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, I think we're going to count that. And then I will screen share. It's your screen. Okay, okay. So you said we had distributions. I already forgot what you told me. Settlements. You reviewed caseless. Okay, so one thing I'm going to do is, like, the description of process. Okay. The reason for this is I'm not asking for what has to be done for distributions. What I'm asking in settlements or review case and anything else. What I'm asking for is, what is your process for deciding that is the thing you're going to spend this minute on, right? Because you have a whole case list, and it's just going to keep getting bigger. So what we're trying to figure out is, what is. the, almost like the equation for saying, this is the thing I'm going to spend my time on now out of all these cases. So when I ask for the description of process, that's it. What's your mental process for going? This is what I'm going to work on now.
00:20:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
I mean, sometimes it'll just come from, if I get an email and look at what it is, and it's like the last thing we need to be able to get a distribution. So I'll just go ahead and request it at that time. Like every like 15 minutes, I just check my email, see what comes up at the top. It's just like a habit. Because in order for distribution, like you usually know like not everything comes in at once to be able to close a case or usually waiting on like one item. Also come from when I review the case list, you know, I'll see that case. I'll go through it. I'm like, okay, we need this. I'll call real quick, follow up, I get it, then I can request distribution.
00:21:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Now, I would imagine distributions when it gets to that point, that's high priority. That's, we don't want to drag our feet. That needs to get moved forward ASAP, right? can you think of anything that as a category, we're not talking about extenuating circumstances, but as a category would rank higher than
00:22:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Probably not.
00:22:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. If you had to guess roughly how much time you spend on distributions, conversations, any part of it, that particular section of the case, what would you think that you do? I don't know. Do you be willing to do the time tracking for just two weeks? It will be really tedious, but I can help you a lot with optimizing your system if I get that information.
00:23:15 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
I really don't want to do it. I mean, I don't feel like I waste that much time.
00:23:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I don't think you waste time. It isn't about wasting time. It isn't that at all. It's about optimization. It's a completely different thing. It has nothing to do with wasting time. It's about looking for the weight. Okay, so checking email every 15 minutes. Absolutely productivity killer.
00:23:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
I don't agree with that.
00:23:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I'll tell you why. And you can tell me why and we don't have time of looking for something to choose to work on. So, like, ideally, that would be better at specific times of day. Even if it's once every hour that you're doing it, being intentional, the problem is emails to volatile, anything could come in. You have to process all of that. If you're shifting from different types of thoughts every 15 minutes, you never get into it. I'm positive. You don't waste time. I'm also positive that you could get more out of your time if you weren't shifting so often. I've yet to find an exception. You could be the exception statistically, psychologically, biologically, physiologically, that would be an extreme anomaly. So, you don't want You don't want to track time, that's fine, but what I would recommend you do is just even just writing things down or just pay attention to where your time is going, but if you want to compete with Samantha, if you want to be top dog, you're going to have to be proactive about all of your time. You could start with just asking Samantha, do you break up your tasks? You just, like, check email constantly just do whatever. It's entirely possible that she does and just analytically processes things very quickly, that she's not even consciously doing it, she just doesn't really do well. But it also doesn't mean that she couldn't be more optimized if she does constantly shift. Everyone can be. There is a, so if you're in the middle of something, doing something, let's say you're just, your brain, like, goes blank for a second, you don't want to or you just check email or there's a ding and you check email you're shifting so now you have to get in this new what is this new thing you have to process it then you might go do it but then when you return to the next type of work you have to ask yourself again okay where was I what am I doing oh yeah that time adds up it could be up to an hour or more a day of just wait where was I what am I doing is there a frequency you suggest to let me check um so it so that's why going through this type of stuff and figuring this out would would be the starting place rather than choosing a frequency arbitrarily so that I understand and and so that you're measuring for yourself um what is the necessity of a going to email to accomplish these things, and whether or not, like, so tagging email first thing in the morning, okay, distribution, settlement, or whatever types of things, right, so you could have different types of labels that you use in your mail, so that first thing in the morning, and this sounds like more work, so I'm going to give you all the processes, you find the thing that works best for you, right? But say, for example, you just have a system of green flags for anything that's distribution, first thing in the morning, if it's in your email, when you're going through distributions, that's what you're going to look at first, and what that does is immediately removes the lag time of having to reread the emails and go, wait, what was this one? Wait, what was this one? You already know because you saw the green flag, that's distributions, I'm not working on that right now, I'm working on settlements, and that's an orange flag, or something like that, so that when you keep like active, activities together, you keep your mind in a similar zone, so you're not constantly shifting back and forth and reminding yourself, what is this? What is this? What is this? That is happening all day long if you're checking your email that often and you're you're reassessing things constantly, which takes seconds, but sometimes but those just seconds add up. So if we go through this, okay, so you've got distributions, you've got settlements. So settlements, would that be the next highest priority?
00:28:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Settlements slash like negotiating.
00:28:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Now I imagine this takes up quite a bit of time throughout the week.
00:28:55 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Oh, yeah.
00:28:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Could you ballpark it like Do you feel like you spend an hour or more a day on distributions and settlements?
00:29:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Like today, I did a distribution. It probably took me like two minutes.
00:29:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:29:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Like I just had to email it to the clients. That's all I did for it.
00:29:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And just one.
00:29:18 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Yeah, because I don't have that many words.
00:29:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's going to be like hours a week, right. And same with settlements and negotiating.
00:29:25 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
No, that's more probably like. Like an hour a day, maybe.
00:29:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and. Reviewing your case list.
00:29:47 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
It's going to be the most.
00:29:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So. Let's. right down reviewing the case list. What types of things are you looking for when you look at that?
00:30:11 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Well, it's like a new case, make sure like all the initial stuff is taken care of, which could be that we found coverage as the police report been ordered, hospital records in order Clamp and reached out to The treatment being set up what what's that treatment? Um, that's yeah, that's for the new ones for like Mid treatment cases, just making sure that You know corresponding Furls are being made, making sure that if it's at a point where we need to request policy when that gets done, as a client we've reached out to, do we have something that, or like we have an MRI, make sure I review it to see if it can be demand early.
00:31:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you can demand early, is that what we said? Yeah. Okay. So like if a MRI indicates a certain kind of injury or something you can do faster and expedite it. Okay. else?
00:31:58 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
That's about it for the middle. treatment stage cases, cases that are like towards the end, making sure that if there are any referrals that the client doesn't want to get or move forward with, give them a call, try and convince them to. If not, make sure Cynthia knows to request all the records. If we're just missing like one, I might send out.
00:32:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We got this for second, I'm so sorry. Keep telling you my internet connection is unstable. What's going on? That's almost never happened. Okay, sorry. Case towards the end, can you start over from me?
00:32:44 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Yeah, see where the treatment left off. If there's a big policy and we're not at the policy point, kind of just see Why why the case is coming to an end if the client didn't want to follow through with the medical referral hold on when you say See with policies like where we're at on policy limits like what do you can you like if there's a hundred K policy, but I look at the notes and It looks like the client's kind of wrapping treatment up Oh before they hit the policy limits like before yeah, like like they they haven't treated To get the policy yet Because they're let's say it's a hundred K and you know He's only gone to pain management and no injections or scheduled things like that Probably means the client doesn't want the injections So on those I'll reach out to the client, you know try and convince them Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't And if they want to close out and make sure send your requests all the medical records If we have like three out of four facilities, I'll just go ahead and send a demand with that.
00:34:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what was that last thing? I'm still running out.
00:34:11 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Sorry. If we have a majority of the records, I'll just submit a demand with those.
00:34:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so you don't demand anything until they're done with treatment and have been taking care of within with the policy will handle. That depends.
00:34:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
You know, sometimes if it's like. There's 15 K on the third party, and I know the client's been recommended injection. I'll demand it right there, even though he has like a hundred on his side. Because I can get the 15 while he's still treating. That's the thing. make sure the health insurance lien has been requested and then you know depending on the client you know based on my experience with them thus far if they really need you I'll let him know hey you know this is where we're at with the case this is what I'm gonna do next so I might make a call or a text there I guess the next category would be like cases in negotiations see where the last offer was left off if you just call see if you know why they're not able to get to the number we're at Um, why they were not able to get to the number right, I think that I'm offering or I'm okay.
00:36:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, negotiations is about your attorney fees.
00:36:22 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
No, this is settlement.
00:36:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So with the insurance companies, or, okay.
00:36:28 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Yeah.
00:36:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so this would be about policy limits. Or no.
00:36:36 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Uh, it could be policy limits. This is like pre us. Pre settlement, so I'm trying to get to a settlement.
00:36:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Just trying to make sure that. I want to understand a neph of the process too, because one of The things that we're going to get to is figuring out how much of this stuff you do, how much of it is done by anybody else on your team. Really want to understand more about the process and the nuance of it. So the mechanics of it, we don't get into too much with with Mark and love for getting through some stuff. But but even being able to understand that better will also help me figure out how to lend support and kind of optimize what's happening, which ultimately is more profitable for everybody to move on. Okay, so where we weren't able to get to the number we want for settlement.
00:37:36 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Okay, what else? If it's like at a standstill, you know, ask the client to write a statement. Now we've been doing the second voice, so I'll, you know, reach out to someone to second voice it. Sometimes it includes if the number is a fair number and they're, you know, Max out and the client's the one that's not willing to accept Try and convince the client that To go to offer and they should accept it Often do you think that happens?
00:38:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm-hmm not much Right now I just have one All right, what else in negotiations That's basically it okay, and then distributions We're gonna do settled cases so once it's settled there's still some stuff to do You
00:39:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Get the release, which is basically the formal agreement that, you know, works up in the settlement. Again, negotiating with the doctors for their. I would that part of we don't do we have a department for that.
00:39:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The department. And inside a sweet lot.
00:39:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Yeah.
00:39:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who does that.
00:39:38 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Oscar.
00:39:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I'm just curious about just understanding that where does Oscar. What are his other functions or is that it.
00:40:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
He does that, he helps with distributions. There's some more stuff I'm not sure, maybe marketing here and there.
00:40:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that too, but I know I've heard his name before. Okay, I gotta look Oscar up later. All right, so you don't have to do that. That's good because that sounds tedious as crap. What do you need to go sharing with the clients, the doctors, and they're like, basically, if I give up my fees, it's so you can make your fees.
00:40:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
seems like a tug-of-war that just would suck. The only thing that we do is we send Oscar the numbers.
00:40:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. Then what?
00:40:59 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
If it's. There's you I am to go after prepare that for.
00:41:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's you I am under insured motorist coverage.
00:41:09 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
So you first have to get the third party settlement. You have to get their policy limits before you're able to demand for the U.
00:41:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am. I believe that is enough for myself. Because if they have it that they're not uninsured right to see you've checked that first is that the whole. Underinsured yeah. Oh underinsured okay not uninsured uninsured means that they don't have insurance and we're just dealing with the client insurance from the start right so when you say you I am it was under insured.
00:41:55 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Underinsured yeah technically meaning you know we got their policy limits and it's still not in.
00:42:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have to cover it therefore they were under and true of it. Okay. Where am I Go. Okay. There's you. am go after that.
00:42:22 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
And then. And then. I guess the next category would be like distribution.
00:42:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, are you one that does most of that on your team or all of it?
00:42:47 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
I do all of it.
00:42:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so we talked about how much time is just not a lot the way. I mean, cases take a long time. You've got like 140 cases or something somewhere around there. And I know how many of you think that you do a month on average right now, knowing that that number is changing and increasing? I mean, what distributions will you work on in a month?
00:43:26 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
And I guess I So this month so far, I've got one, two, four, five, six, seven. I was going to say roughly 15 at the moment, we'll just move on.
00:44:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, oops. Here. So would you be interested in asking Samantha to show you kind of like her. Like, does she have any system? Does she have any sort sheets where she, like, how does she organize things and just look at her and see. And it may not be anything you want to do, right? Just because that's her process doesn't mean that's the way that you would work. But since you've already been asking her questions and What I think is, so the way that I figure out my systems is almost by triangulating. I get information from different people, I never copy anybody's system because nothing works best for me. There's nuance to everyone and that really should be the process. I'll give you some feedback. You can get some stuff from Samantha, you can ask other people but ultimately the best system is going to be one that you've custom made. There are things that all of us are adverse to for different reasons and it doesn't matter if the only reason we're adverse to it is because we just don't like it, we don't want to do it. What you have to figure out is what creates the most friction and drag and what creates the the best, the smoothest effort, right? And there are multiple things that will do that. drag can just be you don't like it, like you don't like reading books. It's not that you don't like learning, but you don't read books, right? We all have different ways that we we function and do things. So then but then sometimes what will happen is what we may like less is not being the last not getting the the cases done that we want to get, not making the amount of money that we want to make. And so, and this is one of those things where they say people make changes when the pain of staying the same is more than the pain of change. So if the only way to be the top dog and sweet law was to read books. And month after month after month and obviously that is not the way that that would work. I can't Think of a better example, we think about anything else. But we'll just say that that's what it was. If you knew without a doubt that the only way to be top dog and sweet law was to read books, I think you'd read the book. Eventually, you'd just be like, this sucks, this sucks, this sucks. I know that that's the thing, so why would we do that? Now that's not the thing. But what will be the thing will be your processes, will be how you organize your time and how you utilize your resources, because you have fixed resources. You're not going to get a whole big team to do other things if you can't manage your resource as well. 100%, the way to win, the game that you want to win to get the most amount of money, the highest payout to be top dog in the firm. If that's the main thing, I would think earning the money would be the main thing and doing it really well. So those are tied things, right? Because you're not, I don't think you're the type of person and be like, I want to make all the money to help with everybody else. already know that that's not the case, right? So it's got to be a crossover type of rule. So figuring out how to create a system that works, that doesn't annoy you, doesn't piss you off, doesn't feel tedious, will be the thing. But one of the things you I want you to just kind of keep in the back of your mind is, you may want to, it may behoove you to be less annoyed about certain types of things. It may not. This is all theoretical at the moment, things to consider. is there any activity that you do now, food that you eat, anything that you do because you know it gets you what you want, but you used to hate it. And now you don't because it gets you what you want. Can you think of any example like that in your life?
00:49:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Oh, chicken reps.
00:49:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I actually have to eat that at three, and I'm already thinking about it. Yeah, and so let's be a little bit more detailed. What was this specific thing that Chicken Frost does for you?
00:49:21 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Yeah, it's really big and strong.
00:49:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And protein levels are hard to get, huh?
00:49:27 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Yeah.
00:49:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. why chicken out of any other protein?
00:49:33 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Um, stelliness, you know, gets you where you need to be with the least amount of comms, I guess.
00:49:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So, um, it was a tradeoff, something you wanted more than not eating, boring, old chicken breast. Right? So, at some point, there may be some chicken breast you got to eat every day. If so, this to the thing I want you to really think about. And I know what you're driven towards. But if you're going to be top dogs, lean and mean, right, in sweet law, then what's your protein here? It's going to be using your time the most strategically every day. But if you don't know what is the most important thing, and if you're just going to email and reacting to whatever's there, I guarantee you that that's just it's not cutting it. I mean, it could be, we call it P protein. It could be salmon with all the extra fat like all day long. It could be like high fat beef. I don't know, but it's not optimized. It comes with cost. It comes with side effects that you don't want. Yes, you're working consistently throughout the day. And yes, you're probably making calculations on the fly about what you should do. But it it's still reactive. So going through and looking at these things and kind of triaging your activities throughout the day and throughout the week is going to, and I don't, there is no perfect way to do that, but being intentional about that is the first part of the strategy and it's the first thing that kind of will unlock things. So we know this Samantha is really smart about how she does things. I would recommend just go ahead and ask her, hey, do you have a system for like ranking? you like, what does your day look like? I would ask her, like what does your day look like? Is it the same every day? Do you have a rhythm? you have a routine? What does that look like? And how did you arrive there? Did you used to just like check email all the time and what was that like? I would like really ask lots of questions around where she is now, where she used to be, what the difference was as that happened. Um, and maybe you can ask other people. I don't know. I don't think that there's anybody else to model knowing what I know about you and sweet law. Mark's MO is very different. Um, being, you know, the business owner. What he does on cases and because he works them so little like I don't think he's he's the most optimized at that because he's doing all kinds of other things. So that's not a good model. Um, you're not doing litigation. So not Nick. Lorenz doesn't have the pace and he's not really the one to model after right now. And who else we have? Hank is new. So Samantha's Samantha's the girl plus she saw dog anyway.
00:52:49 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
So. Yeah, no, I've talked to her before and she's given me some, like I used to come in and like do demands in the mornings because when I started here, that's all I was doing. Mm hmm. And then she told me like she will do it towards the end of the day because there's usually less phone calls, the adjusters are already gone. So it's like if you can reach the adjuster in the morning, use that time to do your negotiating and stuff like that. And then by the end of the day, it's like the demands are so like chilling mode for me. Like I can just sit there and do them and it's kind of like a break. So I started doing those like at the end of the day too.
00:53:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so you're already recognizing a rhythm that you have and of the task and you okay, what else do you know like is there anything else that you kind of tend to select specific times of day to do. like how is it so far already?
00:54:02 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Sorry let's do like adjust your phone calls and stuff like once as soon as I get into like 2pm ish. It's like sometimes they're on mountain time Eastern time so that's like usually the cut off file reviews to like around like 2pm we'll just go through how long does adjust their conversations take how much time do you think you spend week say like maybe 10 hours I don't know
00:55:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that would be like averaging two hours a day. Does that seem fall-parkish? Yeah. All right. What about far review? Specific time of day and roughly how long is there a specific time of day that you tend to do that more?
00:55:27 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Like after 2 p.m. I'd say like 3.30 to 5 is like 5.30 is like demand time. Sometimes you may not have a demand to write. So it's just like extra far review or sometimes I'll just reach out to clients like big ones just to kind of talk to them a little bit.
00:55:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
On a 5-bit one.
00:55:57 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Like usually 100k plus.
00:56:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many of those do you think you have right now?
00:56:10 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
That'd be 10.
00:56:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, I shared this with you. These notes are bad. The order is not great. This will start to improve its structure over time. Would you be willing to, through the week, just kind of observe what you think your schedule is? I would love for you to do one thing this week and maybe next week as well. Check email once per hour instead of every 15 minutes and see.
00:56:55 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
I don't think it's every 15. I'm just giving a number like sometimes if I'm writing a demand. an hour goes by and I don't check it but I do check it pretty frequently.
00:57:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so at the very least though, I'm being more specific about it. Maybe every hour and it may even get to every two hours or after specific chunks of time. So if you're in a transition mode already, that makes sense to be able to check emo, right? So if you did distributions and you've completed it, there's nothing to do that day and these aren't very long so that's probably not a good one but let's say settlements and negotiating. Let's say you've knocked that out. Okay, this is a shift period, now I'm going to go to a different type of activity. Checking email just to see if there's anything that already falls within your priority list, right? Needs to be done, needs to be responded to, that's a good. So using email as a transition time intentionally or specific slots of the day where you're going to it, looking for... things according to your order of priority. And then marking them and flagging them in some way, keeping a very simple system, Patrick, I'm telling you, very simple system of using the built-in flagging system, right, in the emails for colors so that you can just glance at that. you already read it once. You don't have to read it twice. If I put this flag on, I know it's ready for distribution. I know it's ready for settlement. I know it's, let's say, mid-treatment. There's usually about four flags, yellow, orange, red, blue, so maybe five flags. if you just have some assignments, then what you'll do, it's only few minutes a day, but it's more than that. It's in you can do. So you're going to make yourself a little bit more potent for specific applications. activities because you had to do less of it in email. So once you've identified what the email is because you read it, flag it. And when it's not in that thing anymore, change the flag color, or remove it completely. It's a tiny little thing. This is gonna be chicken. I'm telling you right now. This is chicken breast. It's, it will make a difference. It's annoying, but it will stop being annoying pretty quickly. Once you do it regularly, it I have no other way to explain it to you other than, you know, over two decades and hundreds of people that I've been working with. It's the simple little thing. So if that doesn't work, I don't know how else you could organizing that, but organizing email to a degree. Now, there's a way bigger way to do it, where you could create folders, drag everything into this, blah, blah, That's, that's a pain in the . Using the built-in flag. system. It's right click on the email and you choose a color. Eventually you'll remember what the color I think you'll do it very quickly. That will help. So that's what I would like you just to consider. I don't want you to half- it so if you're not going to do it don't do it. If you're going to do it stick with it and I really want you to consider it to be like chicken breast. Give it a little while if you're going to do it. And then the other thing is just really try to even if you just make some notes okay this is how I spent my time just a little bit for a week. Any amount of really specific information the fact that I asked you how long you spent on time you're like I don't know rough idea ballpark. If you want to play high level if you want to be top dog if you want to get the most out of get these cases done more efficiently knowing where your time goes. He is 100% the key to unlocking that, so you just have to decide if that's the thing that you really want to do. So ponder that for me, and we'll, so we have group talk next week. I'd be interested to see how Lawrence goes through his day too. And again, it's just kind of a slow and steady process, and you'll think new thoughts every week, and you'll gain a little bit more knowledge and gain a little bit more experience that we keep moving it forward. But these are the leverage points. So anyway, thoughts, questions, comments, annoyances.
01:01:47 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
No, I guess I never really like broke down. You know, what I spend my time on, like day by day.
01:01:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me ask you this, when you go to the gym, do you have a routine?
01:02:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Sometimes I'll make it up as I'm going, but it's like a certain body part in that day.
01:02:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. And do you ever just not do a certain body part by ever just completely neglect any muscle group?
01:02:18 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
No, never.
01:02:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So even though you're going and you may not have a routine, a workout routine, you mentally are calculating, I've got to do these muscles. I've got it like upper, middle, lower, you're thinking about everything that has to be done and you're thinking about even subconsciously the fact that you've got to create some balance. Like, you know, if you don't work, if you've worked the front of your muscles, but not the back of your muscles, you create imbalances, you know that, right? Like if you work your quads and not your hamstrings, you're going to have hip issues. There are things that we're doing constantly, and some of It is just because we've been doing it so long, but this you haven't been doing so long. And so you're there are some things that you can learn about why you do it. So I don't know what kind of results you get at the gym, but just kind of think about this. Like that is the area where you spend the most time on what makes you happy. And what is it that but so the thing that I know that you're going for is is we'll say be and talk about like you want to be the best attorney at Sweet Law. That is not going to come from just showing up and grinding. That comes from strategy. So that's the thing that's a little kind of bug I want to plant in your head to think about that and really just kind of breaking it down and understanding what does what. So you understand that there's different types of protein. You understand that there's different types of training to do. Everything gets us different types of results. That's what I want you to think about how you show up to work. The way that we do things matters and specific results are going to come from specific types of effort.
01:04:29 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
So just two lunches to work every day. First one is beef.
01:04:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
second one is chicken.
01:04:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Yeah, chicken and they have turned in. I put it off because I don't want to eat it.
01:04:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
See and now I would eat the chicken first. So I just like it's done and then I would savor the beef later and be like that so that I get to look forward to it because I like doing that with my energy. I want to knock the crap out first and then get to the good stuff for the rest of the day. Yeah, but that's the thing though, understanding how you tick what what makes you work. So and then also sometimes asking yourself, but does it work better for me that way? What would happen if I knocked it out instead of going stupid chicken for more hours, right? And just go now while you only got away for two or three hours, eat the chicken. Chicken's gone. I get beef legs.
01:05:29 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Have it a bad day. then I got to hit the chicken now.
01:05:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm even worse day. Yeah, right. So there's a book called eat that frog. I've never read it, but it's basically about do the hard thing as soon as possible so that you're not mentally being dragged down by the stuff that has to happen. Get the hard stuff done so that you can coast for the rest of the day. But it really isn't about coasting. It's because even if you want to like play hard, you're not diminished by the human. feeling resistance like I don't want to do it. So think about what where resistance shows up and you know how much you want to let it have power over you.
01:06:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
So when someone asks you if you want the good news or bad news first you always take the bat.
01:06:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Always always always always because if they tell me the good news first I can't appreciate it because I want to know what the bad news is. I won't even be in that moment. The pain is coming. Shut the up and give me the pain. I watch the needle going in if I get shocked. I want give me the pain first. So I'm done with it every time. Every time because I want to be fully present for anything I get to enjoy. If I have to eat broccoli but I get cake I will throw up eating all the stupid broccoli and then don't talk to me. be until I'm done with it. And then when I'm eating my cake cup also because I want to be fully present, don't talk to me. Just let me eat my cake. And I'm going to really enjoy it. But I'm really, really, really conscious and intentional when it comes to energy. So, like, anything that has to happen. So, if I go get waxed, right? If the girl is talking to me, I'm like, you need to stop talking for a sec, because I need to focus. If I can breathe, it doesn't hurt me that bad. If she's talking, then I'm just like, I'm flinching and that stuff, but I can breathe through it. So, yeah, that's just something to think about. noticed like, you're young, you've got lots to learn still, and you've got through military, so you've got some different experiences. play around a little bit with things. things with routine and figure out what gets you better results. It's not so much about what you like better because that's going to be clouded by what you're experiencing at the moment. Ask yourself what gets you better results at the end of the day, wherever you can reduce stress and friction and most stress and pain comes from anticipation and people don't take that into account on that. That's why I choose what I choose first because I understand the anticipation is the pain. It's not just eating the chicken is the fact that you're sitting there thinking about it all that time. That is real distress in our minds and our bodies. It literally could pump cortisol into you just thinking about the stupid chicken. And then, but there could be literal endorphins and dopamine coming from you get the beef. Also because it's the vitamins. make a load way above chicken. Those B vitamins and steak and beef, if I'm in a really bad mood, I almost always don't eat beef because I don't digest it well. But if I can't figure out my mood, no matter what, if I go eat a steak, those B vitamins. Oh, through the roof. B12B6. I know those ones, I don't know about what else. B2B2. Yeah, it's good stuff. So think about those things, play around and just kind of observe them. And it doesn't always have to be the same, but be conscious about what you're choosing for yourself. And think about the thing that might be draining you a little bit because you're anticipating something you don't want. Knock it out. Yeah, I got chicken waiting for me. I'll tell you what though, and they may even happier than hate that saying something.
01:10:04 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
So, also, sorry about your talking to Are we with Lorenz next week?
01:10:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

Are you guys here together? Can you hear me? Hello?
00:00:56 - mark sweet
You Hey.
00:01:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi, I can hear you guys. I'll hear you. Do I have both of you?
00:01:06 - mark sweet
No, I'm going to do a round then. Hold on, absolutely my mouth.
00:01:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going see you too. I'm going brush my teeth and I feel like I missed something and it's driving me nuts. I'm tired. Hey.
00:01:42 - mark sweet
Is this a home office or office office? No, it's not. The office is the one usually see it with the window where you can see the airplanes.
00:01:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, we're hardly ever on video, so I don't know. Now we've got Chona. Oh, no audio yet. Water. Oh, there. Something. Hi. I am so excited to meet you in person. Well, Zoom person, you know, this person. You're so pretty. I mean, I mean, you're gorgeous.
00:02:26 - Chona Sweet
Oh, thank you. It's probably a good idea.
00:02:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've got like three tablets, three laptops, one desktop, you know.
00:02:43 - Chona Sweet
Oh, I was drinking a crap.
00:02:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I thought that the this would be the fastest way to kind of figure out what, because you've talked about what Chona's doing a little bit Mark and like how there's some income potential there and then Chona you're just getting your head wrapped around showing up being the schedule and then also Mark has a different kind of brain those those business brain people it can be a lot so it's a good thing it's just not you know like trying to get on the same page with everybody we all think differently and very intensely so mark if you would pretend I don't know anything about anything and give me just the real like third-grade version of what you see the potential is then we can start the conversation from there yeah so there's
00:04:00 - mark sweet
three income streams.
00:04:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:04:04 - mark sweet
The first one is what I would consider traditional medical practice.
00:04:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:04:10 - mark sweet
So the doctor, his name is Dr. E, just so we're all kind of on the same page. Okay. Dr. E's primary practice is traditional healthcare pain management.
00:04:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you.
00:04:24 - mark sweet
So he is the pain management provider of multiple facilities and clinics. what I mean by facilities is hospitals, including health insurance. So he primarily bills health insurance, gets reimbursed from health insurance, and that's where he's paying employees from.
00:04:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:04:48 - mark sweet
That'll make sense.
00:04:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sort of. is my problem with trying to take notes and listen at the same time.
00:04:54 - mark sweet
So I'm just going to listen and let the AI note taker do its job. So most people who are professional, being doctors or nurse practitioners, those are the people seeing the patients, get paid on a per visit payment.
00:05:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:05:09 - mark sweet
So you get paid X amount per person that you visit, more people you see, more money you make.
00:05:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:05:18 - mark sweet
So that is in the hospital, some of it's in clinic settings, some of that is telehealth follow-ups.
00:05:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:05:25 - mark sweet
Yep. Now I'm ready to get paid the same across the board, no matter what that is. Okay. So when you generally want to go to places, we're going to see more patients, because if you're driving around and only seeing two patients at each place, you're kind of losing time on money. So let's say one facility, a 17 new people to see and one has two. Right. advertise a 17. So that's the main traditional practice. Okay. Second part is the personal injury practice. Okay. So that's most similar to what Fuji does, from kind of what you know, the difference is Dr. E. he doesn't just do consultations. He does procedures and surgery.
00:06:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:06:07 - mark sweet
So he works with a wide variety of lawyers and other doctors. So we're used to seeing maybe 10 or 15 lawyers that food you might work with, Dr. D for hours 50 of them. Some good, some bad, some in the middle. Okay. And so part of running Chona on is the medical records for a traditional practice versus PI practice. Well, they necessarily shouldn't be this way are different. Okay. Here's what I mean by that. Good enough is good enough a lot of the time for traditional practice. So we're noticing and seeing a lot of dictation service from Dr. D, where it's just dragon dictation and writing the notes. Okay. But there's a lot of typos and misspellings and some other things because it's not perfect. Which the general gist is there. Okay. In personal injury, that causes problems when you get into litigation or further on, because it looks like you're doing what you need to do. And so bringing on Chona is a couple of things. One, being able to see more personal injury patients. Two, having someone who actually can write records and reports that make sense, which is part of what I've been working with her on. There's lot of things that would get complicated and we can jump into those later. Very, very simple right now.
00:07:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, thank you.
00:07:31 - mark sweet
Now Chona can do some basic procedures as an NP, like trigger points and couple of good things.
00:07:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But... Hi, sorry, my daughter's leaving for the night.
00:07:46 - mark sweet
But she can't do things like surgery. She can assist, but she can't do the surgery itself, because she's not the doctor. So the payment structure is a little bit different in that now, legally speaking, she can only get paid for the person she sees. cannot get paid a percentage.
00:08:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, legally formal, yes.
00:08:05 - mark sweet
So we worked out a version of that that makes a lot of sense for her. And I'm assuming hypothetically speaking, hypothetically speaking, there might be a 50 50 split on consultations. So similar to like what Fuji does now where it's 400 500 visit. So split between Chona and Dr.
00:08:27 - Chona Sweet
E.
00:08:28 - mark sweet
And then 20% of whatever the procedure values are. Now procedure values tend to be much more significant, usually running anywhere between 4,000 up to 50,000 plus per procedure.
00:08:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And why would he be interested in sharing that? Because Chona would be the one who is in these patients and people that I know. And how are you getting around the legalities of that? are you creating some other kind of that kind of person, company, whatever.
00:09:03 - mark sweet
So it's a little C and thing. follow our taxes separately, like everything to keep separate.
00:09:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:09:11 - mark sweet
So I get no personal benefit out of doing this. I just get a happy wife.
00:09:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I get some personal benefit. That's not what I mean.
00:09:18 - mark sweet
Like, I think referrals, maybe, for example, Christian, honey, I think that's what people that I know. Because again, I know that Sean is going to do a good job. And, you know, a lot of issues are the same things like these pain doctors get really busy and don't do as good of a job.
00:09:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get that. That's helpful because it's a little more onto it. But when you said technically, she can only get paid per procedure and can't really get a referral fee. How are you structuring that?
00:09:50 - mark sweet
You know, there's a lot of marketing costs involved in what she does. And so more than sure, Dr. would be very happy to pay a marketing fee to help her continue to grow. I wrote for a pipeline.
00:10:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got it. Got it. Um, valid and creative. Well done. So, okay.
00:10:12 - mark sweet
Um, then there's number three because that's number two.
00:10:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you.
00:10:17 - mark sweet
It's okay. Um, and number two, number two or semison. Chona does not need doctor supervision in multiple other states. California is one of the few that she has to be under doctor supervision. So, you know, when you go to the doctor, usually see a PA or an NP, like most of the time. Um, in Washington state, she does not need to be supervised by a doctor. There are. What about Oregon? Sorry.
00:10:46 - Chona Sweet
about Oregon?
00:10:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think you need to an organ either.
00:10:50 - mark sweet
Anyway, sorry.
00:10:51 - Chona Sweet
Carry on.
00:10:52 - mark sweet
Um, but in Washington state, there's two doctors who have tried to use some of the telemed pain docs that we've worked with before. I'm just going to use footage of the exam. and they weren't thrilled with like some of the reports and just again when the pain dogs get really busy things then you get to sloppy. Yeah. And so because I'm I'm just literally friends with these people they'd be more than happy to send you know about 10 to 20 patients a week to try not just to do consults. She would not need to split any fee because she'd be off on her own without any doctors provision. That's what I like do procedures she can't do anything else obviously.
00:11:26 - Chona Sweet
I can do trigger points.
00:11:29 - mark sweet
You're not flying up to see how to do it right away. It doesn't make sense.
00:11:32 - Chona Sweet
Yeah.
00:11:34 - mark sweet
Because we'd have to find a surgery center or an office and it comes with its own liability and everything else.
00:11:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean but what if there's a good song skiing?
00:11:44 - mark sweet
You would have to find rent out medical spaces expensive.
00:11:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:11:49 - mark sweet
Jeez. Whatever.
00:11:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not saying that it couldn't happen in the future but for the short cut. No, no, no. I mean you know I'm joking obviously.
00:11:58 - Chona Sweet
But these are options. I mean again if she gets busy No, up there to go up there twice a week to go and do procedures that she can earn more for than.
00:12:04 - mark sweet
Yeah, it does make sense. The issue is trigger points only pay about 800 each, and she's going to about 450 for a console and trigger points take out as much if not more time.
00:12:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice click and do you and I know the answer to this, but I'm going to ask it anyway, have a spreadsheet with all of the income earning opportunities and that makes some basic calculations on what can happen. Then roughly how long each of those procedures or types of income opportunities take to fulfill so that you can figure out roughly what the earning potential is.
00:12:40 - mark sweet
In my head, because there's the same limitation that kind of Fuji has, she can really only see about 400 patients in a month, more than that you start paying for that.
00:12:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:12:51 - mark sweet
so, part of the benefit with being under the doctor in California is the doctor's going to be signing their reports and records so it allows her to have a little bit more flexibility and to make It's kind of like cheating, I guess, to be able to see more people, not really cheating, but...
00:13:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or you could see 400 people and try to get them to come back for other like follow-ups and whatnot.
00:13:12 - mark sweet
More procedures and things. problem on the legal side is this, because the limits are what they are, there are times where you just, even though they may need that procedure, there's not enough money to get that to actually happen.
00:13:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it's 400 in a month, right?
00:13:28 - Chona Sweet
It's not just 400 you've ever seen per person.
00:13:31 - mark sweet
Per month.
00:13:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Per month, okay. month, yes. So then, how have we covered all the income-earning things?
00:13:40 - mark sweet
I felt like we did. Those are the three for her. The only other one for me is essentially what we've talked about with Dan is building out a better software, a better way to do this. With Sime, I report writing that could get away with a lot of the issues that we're seeing like Dr. E and somebody's being Dr.
00:13:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Suffer from. I think that this Steph, me working with Chona is actually probably going to help expedite that. I'll see things that in a different way. So then Chona, let me get to know you a little bit. And now the one thing that I that stood out to me that I was that I'm kind of holding on to is that this is a fulfillment kind of thing like that you didn't really necessarily want before, but do which is like having something of your own, having purpose, not just work, you know, but like something that you're proud of, something that you that you do. But what else could you succinctly kind of summarize what was the catalyst for starting this, what were the things that were happening inside of you that made you say, I'm ready. I want to do that. is because you still obviously have some overwhelm and so not being sure about things, but obviously have enough faith and Mark and in yourself to want to proceed with this. kind of help me figure out like imagine and be there with you when you're like, okay, I am ready and I'm all in.
00:15:23 - Chona Sweet
What was that I think, I'm not sure if Mark mentioned JP, honey. That's so we recently completed more of a kind of individual coaching type service and we it basically helped me I think that'll put it me into myself that I didn't know is there or has always been there but I I just, it's just wake that, you know, passion up again from me. I feel like I've always been passionate and with my career and then life happens. I think I think after my dad passed in 2020, I lost that passion and then, you know, there's some psychological depression with that brief. And, you know, after that coaching, I just have this renewed passion, you know, within myself. And it's like perfect time, you know, when I say it's like just how it happens. Yeah, the coaching finish. And then would you say, mean, a few weeks before I finish, Mark has been talking to Dr. E. So, and then Dr. E again recommended or ask Mark, do you think Jonah would want to? I don't know if I know, you know, the background. I know Dr. E from my previous work. He's a fellow. He's a doctor in training way back in 20 I don't know, 17 2016 no 2014 2015 so he's fellow and I'm a nurse practitioner, but that's how we met with Dr. E at Theodore Sinai And then I introduced him to mark because he the moment he graduated he wanted to hire me That's one of the NPS that I'm not sure. don't want to work too hard And then I introduced him to mark and they clicked cuz they're both you know have that business mentality and Ever since he's been asking me and I said no no no no I don't do this I'm I have an employee mindset I don't think I have no clue anything about business or anything like that. And then finally, I think it's just that, you know, that timing with my personal coach and then Mark talking to him and I didn't even realize that I'll have a second or I have another job at this time. This is not part of the plan. What you mean another job? I mean not another job, I mean a different job, I mean leaving my previous job because this is a new job for me, so.
00:18:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. What were you doing before? Like were you?
00:18:38 - Chona Sweet
I'm still an I'm a nurse practitioner but more of an internist in a psych hospital.
00:18:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
00:18:46 - mark sweet
Wasn't the last what you're in, you're in a half?
00:18:49 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, the last year and a half, like I started part time with them in late 2022 while I was at UCI doing pain management and then I become time of last year of February. Then I've been doing that. Um, but prior to that, I've been doing pain management since 2013. Since I've become a nurse practitioner in 2013. I've been doing pain management. then I said, I don't want to do pain management anymore. I want something different, more challenging. And it definitely challenged me. biggest population is very challenging, but someone has to, you know, take care of those patients. Again, mental health is the taboo, still even on the medical fields, but in no one needs to help those patients. you know, it's definitely challenging. and then this opportunity arrived and then on the timing of the personal coaching, I said, you know what, not? Well, why can I see that person that can make more that I didn't even realize I can? Obviously, obviously with Mark, I guess. push gentle push like you can do this you believe in what i can do so that helps so what parts of it um excite you the most um the autonomy has always been there that's why i became an arch practitioner that's why i went back to you know getting my master's and doctors like i wanted to be a economist like that that's the driving factor and just in context i left UCI even though i'm paying good money i mean okay money i don't think i feel that they're paying me too much because they're not utilizing my full of potential and i don't like that that's why i left that job and that's why i went to the internist position which even though i'm very autonomous it's a very it's scary you know you have to always I'm back with this patient's mark is always kind of worried that I would come one time I came home with a scratch in my face like the patient do that just like no it's either you know it's a high stress environment but so you and money I mean if you're asking about that the income potential is there 100 percent I mean I'm gonna lie it's not if that's not it but it's more I think the autonomy and the fulfillment of utilizing to my fullest potential trumps the money because if it's really money that I'm talking about like UCI would have been perfect yeah I was just gonna say that doesn't make any sense that money would be even in the top because if you left because they're paying you too much and not using you then your perceived value is more important to you like I think so right Hans because remember how I would always complain that I feel like I'm um, what's that term used? I'm a glorified babysitter. babysitter.
00:22:09 - mark sweet
You're helping the residents at UCI because, you know, they're doing doctors and they don't know what they don't know. And while you enjoy teaching, it was just kind of a, you were there just to make sure they didn't screw up something.
00:22:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so money's definitely not your main driver.
00:22:26 - Chona Sweet
You, you want to serve a purpose.
00:22:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, you might like it, but if she made that decision, money can't be the main driver.
00:22:35 - Chona Sweet
It might be closed, but it can't it's definitely, there's that component of the incompotential of making what two doctors can make in a year. It's definitely there, you know, like I'm gonna lie. But if you tell me that I will be working as what I do at UCI and be a glorified assistant and not utilizing my potential, I will not be happy.
00:23:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Even if I make that much money. So I'm just gonna delineate the difference between making a lot of money and earning a lot of money. So earning a lot of money is important to you. Making a lot of money is not as much. Right. The difference is just it's slight but it's important. Mark, are you laughing about?
00:23:26 - mark sweet
I don't know, like it's nice things. I do.
00:23:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's okay. But it's still that it's not the same. When you tie how you get the money, that matters.
00:23:38 - Chona Sweet
Right. That's that's what I'm saying. That's right for me to even say I felt that I'm getting paid. I'm getting I'm paying they're overpaying yet you said because they're not doing what I'm supposed to do. I feel like that's a good feeling.
00:23:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean if your husband gives you all the things you you are that because you married him.
00:24:00 - mark sweet
So No, we're not.
00:24:02 - Chona Sweet
No, we're not.
00:24:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, we're to see you open this kind of words. Okay.
00:24:06 - mark sweet
Hey, she should make double what she's been making before. The other thing too is, when I tell Med Park, it's more and more robust. It does allow us more flexibility, but from a location standpoint, as well as, you know, a time standpoint. So if we want to travel or one of the other things for kids or whatever else, it gives us more options in terms of working time. And so it's not just a single income leader, know, anything else, trying to instill earn her income and what have you while being able from home or being able to work from wherever we are.
00:24:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:24:40 - Chona Sweet
So freedom. Yes, I like that.
00:24:43 - mark sweet
Yeah. So all these things kind of come together. And the timing was good.
00:24:46 - Chona Sweet
Dr. He's been trying to recruit her for years because he doesn't have to train her.
00:24:50 - mark sweet
And, you know, he's like, make, he's definitely more business focused, but it's kind of raining.
00:24:55 - Chona Sweet
He's all over the place. Oh my gosh. He is.
00:24:58 - mark sweet
Because he just takes on every project.
00:25:00 - Chona Sweet
which is okay but you know he needs people who can do what they need to do and so it's a great learning opportunity and she's going to have more opportunity than she would if she joined you know like any other paint tops that it would work like this procedure I've never done this before but doing procedures which I am very much this is what I'm saying like utilizing to my fullest potential although California we I still need it in collaboration with a physician but this is just the first time after 11 years of the nurse practitioner so first time I'm doing a procedure which is you know it's great it's amazing you like learning yeah yes I do I do and yeah all right so now I understand the why and the what a little bit and now we got to kind of figure out the how that works with chona so the thing and I was talking to you about this last week chona
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the mind is that the beginning is always the hardest, but what I can tell you and hopefully Mark can testify to is that when we really break it down and look at everything, what we're doing is we're going to be looking for leverage and optimization. So what that looks like is for example, you know, seeing more patients in one location, but there's going to be so many things that you're doing that from communication, travel, how certain locations operate, how you plan your day as well as how you start your day. Mark used to start it by checking his phone every first thing in the morning and get stressed out about something that went wrong or whatever, just immediately like it pumps cortisol into our bodies that that's stress of like there's something to do and I'm just like, can you just not look at your phone for a little bit and see how that goes and started working Dolce and there were some improvement. It's like the little things. It's not just the person doing business is the most important part of the business. So we'll talk about a lot of different things and it will start with a lot of questions. So the first step is you've got to get your head wrapped around everything and then you've got to be able to communicate to me enough so that I can get my around everything and so then we can start working together. So it is slow and kind of tedious and overwhelming in the beginning which is why I said you can also feel free to just vent send messages and just kind of vent because even in that venting I'll learn some things I'll learn about you know what's happening and the faster the more we communicate in the beginning the faster I'll be able to get to something useful for you. My standard It is I just talked to people once a week. Although I do tell them hey, you can reach out to me. Nobody does So it takes a long time.
00:28:06 - mark sweet
think you run in photo stuff.
00:28:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know I know thank you so much I love that doggy. I do take doggy payments Yeah, so You know something was just on your mind and you like this happened and I don't know where to put it I don't want to hold on to it You can tell anybody or you can tell me like I said you can just leave me like a voice You know you have an eye called to right Audio messengers are so great because then it does the dictation and I can just read it if I can't listen at the moment And so I will encourage you share as much as you feel like sharing Because the sooner I get all of that the faster will get there Um because I don't even know What questions to ask right now other than mark The fastest way is to get something that we can all look at so we can on same page, right, which is where, what are the offices, what are the opportunities, what are the procedures, what are the all the things. And it seems very tedious and Mark doesn't like tedious, but we can do another group call and I can extract it and I can create the spreadsheet myself. That's totally fine. But and that process actually works really well for me, Mark, because then I'm getting it firsthand and when I'm putting stuff in this spreadsheet, then I wrap my head around it. So what we could do is just schedule a couple more of these calls until I got my head wrapped around all of the opportunities to even start to formulate the questions. And you know how it goes and Mark can explain this to you is the more that we look at, the more we talk about the more that we see, the more the questions formulate, the more you just don't even know what you don't know. So it's a lot of asking questions and then it's just kind of a rough. It's not really fancy and it's not shiny and it's not exciting, but it gets some results and hopefully it'll help you be peaceful sooner rather than later.
00:30:14 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, I feel like everything is up in there. I'm getting used to the flow of the number one, the main traditional, that's what Ricky's He's going to put me because he's really all over the place. He's spread him to the food and he's about to take on a really large contract.
00:30:38 - mark sweet
He's not always going to fulfill it.
00:30:41 - Chona Sweet
So she puts her in Long Beach, which is probably busiest hospital, I would say. Sorry. like my mind no no I have to initiate a lot so like what I feel like I am he doesn't have any plan for me whatsoever I I told him is it okay with you you know being respectful I will shadow this NP you know because I want to know how they do it because the office manager which is Mark's Mary I don't know if you know her but the office manager would tell me don't do how doctor eat that because he does it may definitely you do it the right way so I have to shadow everyone else because I need to know the right way more efficient way so that's what I did yesterday he didn't tell me I have to tell him like I'm doing this is that okay with you sure that's why everything I said sure so I can see myself as my goal knowing what I'm where I am now is I wanted to make sure that the Long Beach Memorial, it will be, I will have, I want to have my roots basically there. Rather than running around, he wants to have a lot of patience, right? don't have that many right now. That's where I wanted to be. If we can get 30 patients a day at Long Beach, that would be nice. Right now, like yesterday, it's less than 20. not a lot. And I just paid per patient. So.
00:32:27 - mark sweet
So she gets between 20 to 30 a patient. So the goals between 30 to 50 patients. And there's not a limit on the number of patients she can see in the traditional sense.
00:32:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So that, all of that is really helpful. And I like that it's going to serve you really well that you recognize his shortcomings and aren't adopting that. Like that, that autonomy, of course, you would want it because you already see how you could do something better or improve.
00:33:01 - Chona Sweet
I already made a suggestion on how to increase, and he's like, oh yeah, we didn't do that, like, okay, this is gonna be a process. I feel like whatever I make decide, as long as it's obviously politically okay, he will say yes, so I have to make sure that we set up dark roots at Long Beach Tomorrow, so that we can see at least 30 a day, that's a goal.
00:33:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And Mark, how fast can you help, like you said, you know, lots of people.
00:33:35 - mark sweet
I'm holding that back until their systems and reports and processes are right because you get only really one chance at it, right?
00:33:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, your reputation.
00:33:45 - mark sweet
Hundreds of other opportunities plus my own personal reputation side into it. So the good news is he already has some PI patients coming in again from what he's doing before. So trying to cut her teeth on those, she doesn't get the same payout. She'll get like more of the traditional payout, but at least. she can cut her teeth, get under control, get the report writing right, figure out how to actually do a better job making sure patients show up because that's a huge issue for this doctor's office. Now on insurance, they're not showing up, it's actually better for him from an insurance perspective because he's paid a flat rate per month.
00:34:20 - Chona Sweet
I don't think about the procedure though.
00:34:23 - mark sweet
No, no, no, no, procedure will get a little more, but like if a patient doesn't show up to the office on the insurance side for him, he's happier, quite frankly. On the PI side, the personal injury side, that means you're not making any money, any wasted time.
00:34:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there's that follow up automation thing that we need to set up.
00:34:46 - Chona Sweet
So okay, he's not very, he's not good, his system is not good. He's hiring more people. There's a lot of non-PI patients that come that they can't get through the phone. So whatever the second income that Mark is saying with the lead, I will have to also drive that and making sure that I am calling, that you're going to have a procedure in this day and make sure you come.
00:35:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In the interim, would it make any sense to do what Fuji is doing and have an offshore kind of team that just does those calls? Because the automations will work better because we can do the text, email call, follow up and it should be cost effective. Plus, we can do all the tracking. But in the interim, without risking your reputation, Mark, and without tona having to be the one to call everybody because that is not the best use of your brain and your time.
00:35:51 - mark sweet
For the problem, we've used Dr.
00:35:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
E before in the past.
00:35:55 - mark sweet
Now, some these have been problems, which tona will be writing them and maybe in. They're okay. It took us multiple months to get signed bills and reports back from him to the point where like a lawyer sued him over and he called me to like to try to get him out of it because he opened for coaching and getting his stuff organized and set out because super busy like I not not yet he's he's going to take over the role mode still.
00:36:23 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, that he's in that mood. They keep would care about what everyone say or he doesn't have any ego.
00:36:29 - mark sweet
He's very nice person.
00:36:31 - Chona Sweet
He just wants to get paid. just wants money.
00:36:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Chaos doesn't take over the world.
00:36:35 - mark sweet
Chaos blows up the world. And the VA thing, we're getting more and more negative feedback from whether it's Fuji or other people who are using it that they really don't like the VA who doesn't know what's going on and a large accent issue. It's a great idea in theory, but I think is you're trying to scale it unless you have the right VA is a balance and issues. So because the volume for P is low. I'm going to believe we're in do everything yourself first so you know how to do it also. Oh, yeah. But until then long term that is not the solution I've shown on calling and setting up that's not the solution.
00:37:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The answer is I do it. We do it. You do it. It's the way to go. It's what I do too. Okay, so do we have other ideas for how to get more more people per day without someone having to call everybody or is that just that's what has to happen right now.
00:37:32 - mark sweet
So right now in my mind is get her feet under her for at least the next like 30 days.
00:37:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:37:39 - mark sweet
Yeah. Get in your sway. Get in going. Right now she's on prescription running power because everything has to get approved. Like you have to get what's it called for the hospital again?
00:37:50 - Chona Sweet
There's a for any doctor to anyone that can there's a process called getting a privilege in the hospital. So it's more thorough, not just background checks, just more deeper kind of employment, I guess, background checks that they do and it takes a while. So now it's been over a month now from Long Beach, so that will take a while. I'm hoping this month it will be done. Is that what you're saying here?
00:38:23 - mark sweet
Yeah, so again, we can't even really get a lot of stuff started till she's got some of these basic things.
00:38:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, that's what I was trying to figure out is like, what's the timeline? So if we spend the next, let's say roughly four weeks meeting, if you're willing to come at least for the next couple mark, because yes. So then we can spend like the next couple calls really kind of extracting the the plan, all the the income opportunities, and I'll put it in a dashboard that will make sense. So we can do some calculations and forecasting for some. potential there. And then Chona can give us that insight about what it's like on the inside, how long these things take, how efficient this process is, how inefficient this process is, and really just kind of take inventory and stock of the operation side of it. And then what we do Chona is just kind of, you know, merge and optimize operations with the financial opportunities together. And where we've got the simplest process to get the most amount of money where those two intersect, that's the most leveraged income. So again, it's a lot of gathering, but gathering from from different aspects. So getting marks kind of planned, your information, feed on the ground, and I'll put it together and organize. And then while you're getting your, you know, why you're just getting used to doing it, and we'll be gathering the data that will then help us to create this strategic plan of Okay. Here's what we do for the next 60, 90 days. Then we do that thing, right? we're observing it as it happens, kind of tracking what's happening as we're doing it. Is it going according to plan? What else are we learning, implementing and inserting that data into what we're tracking? And just, it's an iterative process. So we start with gathering information, sort it, make a plan, and wash runs repeat constantly.
00:40:27 - Chona Sweet
So as of right now, I know that I will be my native Friday. Since I don't have the privilege in the hospital yet, I would do clinics and telemedicine. So that's where I'm at right now on the traditional, on the number one, the main job, basic breath, the main job. The second job mark is holding that back until I'm ready. In the meantime, what I'm doing with that is I'm attending Choice Hall and hopefully where we can be a member soon so I can have access to their ideal note system that way I can incorporate that soon. In the meantime, Marcus is helping me. I show him my notes of the lead, the PI patient, and he tells me this is good, this is not good. And I'm in collaboration with Dr. E to make that better. But all of these, I'm going to have to drive it. It's too busy. Dr. E still busy with this. And the third one, Washington, I have yet to submit the application for what we call reciprocity. Since I'm with that, I have to, I'm licensed in California. I don't have to take the test. I just need to apply. So that's what's going on.
00:41:45 - mark sweet
Question or question of question of question of yet. If we don't do that soon or you have to have Dr. E. Vouch that you have for an active practice in California either he doesn't need to be involved with the reciprocity of Washington, like I just need to apply.
00:42:00 - Chona Sweet
and it will take a month at least to get that.
00:42:04 - mark sweet
We're seeing like three months usually in the doctors.
00:42:07 - Chona Sweet
Oh, Well, the doctors are probably different than the board of nursing. So I don't know, but it will be the board of nursing. But I feel like the Washington one would be the highest potential for income because I don't have to split that with him, with anyone. So I'm excited with that part. I thought she thinks.
00:42:30 - mark sweet
Well, maybe again, you don't to split it. So her, yes, but volume is going to be the question in the problem. Right. So if there's more volume and more procedures in California, she would make more from the California and Dr. E. Yeah, despite having a split because it all just comes down to volume. And I don't have a lot of volume in Washington.
00:42:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know a couple people, but it takes time to spread. Right. And everybody being, you know, having the same type of thought about it. we create the spreadsheet that I'm talking about, Shona, and having all of that, it's going to make all of that easier because we're going to be looking at it mathematically with just really simple numbers, and it's almost kind of polarizing when you see the different opportunities and the things that happen. So it's not so much like that.
00:43:20 - mark sweet
This too is we would still want her to do some of the traditional because it just makes everything else look more legit. Take Fuji, for example, I know keep going back to him I follow it, but he's got the Q and E work, not only makes him money but makes it look more legitimate because Q and E is generally defensive minded. So it makes him look like he's more fair and balanced. If she's doing also mostly health insurance and working through hospitals, it makes it look like she's primarily a primary trader.
00:43:49 - Chona Sweet
Okay, like how Dr. E said it when he was the post and he was asked like this is the same thing I do with my other patients. It's the standard of care. Which is where I want to be. don't want anyone do anything illegal. Dr. E and I are very much in labor. We're not going to do anything, whether the lawyer says we have to do this.
00:44:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We have to stand on our medical beliefs and what is the standard of practice that's where we're at. Good and I mean, it's not philosophy that ever comes up in Sweet Law, but one of my just kind of like principles is have an unimpeachable character, meaning that you do the same thing everywhere you go, no matter what. I will punch an old man in church if he's invading in space and they're like, I don't care. that's not a good example, but it kind of means that even when I'm in the house of God, if somebody is doing something that makes me uncomfortable, I'm going to handle it the same way. Right. you act the same all the time, you treat your patients the same with integrity, obviously honoring the Hippocratic oath and just being there. to do good, then nothing really holds up unless you're just being taxed crazily for some reason.
00:45:07 - Chona Sweet
So however much and organized Dr. E.S. his patients love him. Like he is a good doctor. Like he goes beyond like sometimes the patient is scheduled for example for epidural injections and they don't need trigger point. Trigger point is another payment. He'll waive that. That's the kind of person he is. And I'm actually, I saw it before when he's in training. I know he's a good person, but seeing it now for him 10 years later, it feels good to be working with that kind of person.
00:45:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. All right, now I'm getting a whole kind of picture. And of course, just mark over there being a nice guy with nice people and nice sweet wife.
00:45:51 - Chona Sweet
I do like and she's cute.
00:45:57 - mark sweet
I'm super excited. And so are MPs and people who run businesses too, so you know, yeah, I do I do have friends.
00:46:04 - Chona Sweet
I can I see them their growth and Although I don't want it to say I mean, yes, I see them I get jealous, but I I accepted early on that that's not the path I chose, but now I can say hey I can do this too, okay Yeah, well even in my world I'm in business and I've made people millions and millions and millions and there are female counterparts that I've made way More money than me, but I've had more time with my kids and I coached soccer and I've done all kinds of other things And that was my priority and I picked them up from school.
00:46:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got them up I made them breakfast I went to school three or four times because somebody forgot a notebook lunch or this thought the other and that was my Priority that was what I wanted to do so every night I got that twins, but you pick you pick what you want and there's different seasons in life So you're in a new season and it's fun and exciting and Mark's got people to help you out and you've got people to help you out and you're, you're gonna do awesome. I'm Yeah, I'm so grateful.
00:47:05 - Chona Sweet
Like I told him. I'm so thankful again. I feel tired today. But again, after I talk to you, I feel re-energized.
00:47:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was, I was dragging. I was like, I'm going to pass out. As soon as this call is over, I was ready to fall asleep. So like, Yay, thanks for that mark, too.
00:47:28 - mark sweet
Yeah, I mean, look, this should be good. There's a lot of options here. You know, like to have multiple fasts, not just one. I like it. Flexibility is large.
00:47:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
still want to see the doggy thing happen one day, the doggy food and doggy health.
00:47:45 - mark sweet
I know it has to make money first and be a proven concept and you're not ready. It will happen. This is something that I care a lot about. So, you know, it's about me like when I'm focused, general contestants, but like when I focus on something, it will happen. It doesn't matter how difficult it is.
00:47:59 - Chona Sweet
It happens. It's not a matter of if it's when.
00:48:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I love that tenacity. Okay, well, I don't have any more questions, but I don't know what I don't know, so I don't know if there's something I should ask that I didn't ask. I feel like this was a good start, but anybody have anything else to bring up?
00:48:21 - Chona Sweet
No. I really know my role.
00:48:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You want me to get the operations on my end so I can input it. I just want you to get your footing. I just want you to do what you're already doing, which is noticing what's working well, what's not working well, and get comfortable and then relay that information and that process back. And I want you to not overthink it. Okay, that will really stress you out a lot. I just really just show up, do your best, and know that you're going to make an impact for him, which is going to make an impact for the patient, and you're also going to be able to earn money that makes you feel good because you will know when you earn.
00:49:00 - Chona Sweet
it.
00:49:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, and just enjoy the process as much as you can. Shoot schedule. So you're gonna have to have evenings for the foreseeable future, is that right?
00:49:14 - Chona Sweet
I think, I think for right now, that's what I'm seeing.
00:49:19 - mark sweet
So, would you rather try to do a morning or no?
00:49:22 - Chona Sweet
I think the moment, like I was telling Tina, the moment I know the assigned patients to me, if I, I think once I get the hospital work done, and then I would know my schedule, like I would know how, because it's just right now, it's still up in there.
00:49:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're the only person in the world, I would be the selectable for, but I'm going to be the selectable them.
00:49:44 - mark sweet
going to the to the selectable I'm going the selectable them.
00:49:48 - Chona Sweet
don't have any, like, what I'm saying is, I feel like you have like a midday even in the clinic, there's a lunch break, but I'm saying that if I have you, two, then I can push back the hospital. What I'm saying is I can go after. Like, again, the only one with the scheduling is the clinic. If they scheduled patients for me during this time, time frame, so that would be it. But the hospital, I have no time there. I would go when I can. If I go early, some doctors go at five a.m. a.m. the patient. Like, like, I don't want to do that. mean, I'm not going to wake up the patient.
00:50:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so right now you are at the hospital every day.
00:50:31 - Chona Sweet
No, not right now. still don't have access. I don't know the moment that I get that. I'm I'm assuming. I mean, I'm not. I'm hoping it will be soon because I I did the process in less than a day.
00:50:48 - mark sweet
Mark knows and everything. Yeah, it's just we're just waiting for approval.
00:50:52 - Chona Sweet
We're just waiting.
00:50:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's just waiting at this point. Well, do you want to schedule a week to week for right now, then? If that's okay. Yeah, let's do that. So next week, I have my girls for the weekend, so I like to keep Fridays open. And the week after that, I'm traveling, but we're not going to talk about the week after that yet. So how about next week, Thursday evening?
00:51:13 - Chona Sweet
that work? Yeah, that's okay. Are you okay there?
00:51:20 - mark sweet
I just have something from four to five, but that's it.
00:51:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We don't know.
00:51:29 - mark sweet
You have to come in the evening anyway, right?
00:51:33 - Chona Sweet
Like after that, Shona? Yeah, I'm, I'm the director say evening, if that's okay with you.
00:51:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, yeah, so like six or like what time?
00:51:43 - mark sweet
I think six, it's just mark that I don't know what time mark is okay. Yeah.
00:51:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, well, we said, so I'm assuming that you're not available until evening.
00:51:55 - Chona Sweet
When are you first available and like you have time, you'd be ready for tab a call. I think. I Thursday, I should be available, again, because I don't know my schedule yet, I should be available after five.
00:52:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's what I must, you know.
00:52:12 - Chona Sweet
Okay, I'm just assuming office hours because I like today.
00:52:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so let's shoot for six o'clock and if we need to adjust it, we'll adjust it.
00:52:24 - Chona Sweet
Okay.
00:52:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so it will be the same line and we'll plan on meeting at six and I'll send the calendar invite and then next week we will talk about the following week. Okay. And so next week, Mark, whatever you need to have access to or be looking at to be able to feed me information about income opportunities, specifically, like, is actual data as possible.
00:53:00 - mark sweet
I know it's more theoretical unfortunately.
00:53:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, that's fine too. Whatever we have to start with, but my point is that if you can just have yourself either mentally ready, if you have to be at a computer, just whatever, that be able to have that type of conversation will be really useful.
00:53:16 - mark sweet
Look at your word response, Fred.
00:53:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She just has the general numbers, but who can kind of them? That's an better start. Okay, I am so excited.
00:53:24 - Chona Sweet
Trona, do you have any questions? No.
00:53:27 - mark sweet
Did she hear dogs?
00:53:28 - Chona Sweet
She has dogs.
00:53:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, what? They are not here. They are feeding with fluffy dogs. I have a poussaint. She's a poodle and a bee shan and I have a havinese boy. And the poodle has purple and blue hair dye right now because my daughter loves to be ticker to the beach and her hair was just flowing and the little kids are just like, oh it's a rainbow puppy. We love dogs. And we have birds in a bearded dragon also, so what I was a dad And the bearded dragon he's like this big and he loves to just hang out on shoulders and do you see He's I feed it with life In pics, uh, well he gets freeze dried mealworms. He loves blueberries. He loves kale Oh, Sometimes we will get him live prickets. Yeah, that's my daughter. I like lizards in the wild They're very adorable in the wild. Yes I don't think he should be in a cage. Anyway, I don't like cage down Tina is a big fan of the dog food idea Yeah, um dogs. Okay. I'm not going to cry.
00:54:45 - Chona Sweet
So we're gonna talk about something else Yeah, yeah, I'm excited for this.
00:54:51 - mark sweet
I'm for showing.
00:54:51 - Chona Sweet
I'm excited for you know the future I feel like there's dr. A like we're gonna start slow, but then there's a part of me that I'm good I'm ready to go like, you know, like, but then he I think it's in my head and I kind of verbalize it, but we'll take it slow, and it's like, okay.
00:55:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't always don't take anything slow.
00:55:14 - Chona Sweet
They go.
00:55:16 - mark sweet
It's the idea of slow, but it's not crap. This happens and now we're, yeah, we're.
00:55:21 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, the moment that he have at least 6,000 new ones coming in this October, they're already trickling in. So we'll see how that goes.
00:55:30 - mark sweet
new patient's starting in two weeks. Yeah. What? It's like 10 plus people before then.
00:55:36 - Chona Sweet
Well, let's say, and not all of them are paying patients to collect chronic pain. So let's say at least, I don't know, 30% are on chronic, have chronic pain. But basically any one of them that have pain issue, they can't, they will come to us. So, there's that, there's that new thing too that I will, my name. It will be one of the top again, because I'm paying, I'm going to to push out a lot of narcotics, so there's that too. I'm not thrilled, but I'm comfortable if that makes sense, because it's my speciality, but yeah, it's just what it is.
00:56:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good.
00:56:19 - Chona Sweet
Buckle up, lady.
00:56:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh. All right, well, I am looking forward to it. And I think just a little bit, I've been able to talk to you. I can tell that you are made of some exceptional stuff, and that you're about to be tried in the fire. yeah, but my favorite thing about it is it feels amazing to know what you're made of, but you can talk about what you're made of all day long, and you can feel it inside of yourself. Until you get tested, you don't really know. And the tests are painful, but they come with a level of conviction that nobody can shake. Nobody can make you feel less than when you've done. and the really hard work. And so I'm excited for you to feel a whole new kind of level of who you are and what you're made of.
00:57:08 - Chona Sweet
Right. Thank you.
00:57:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

Hello.
00:00:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, how are you?
00:00:04 - Michael’s iPhone
Good, well.
00:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
are you? Good. How's the babies and the family?
00:00:10 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, it's exhausting. I forgot. I forgot how tired you could go, but I can't complain to you. You are Esther. You guys are the ones actually doing it.
00:00:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, it is a family thing that whole, it's not just a women thing, although we definitely definitely got a lot to do.
00:00:30 - Michael’s iPhone
I'm pretty sure you guys do the bulk of it.
00:00:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, I just saying it's not just stuff.
00:00:37 - Michael’s iPhone
I will agree with you, that it's all right.
00:00:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My power, power went out and all my stuff. Yeah, I had to reset everything and like log back in and load my browser windows and all of that.
00:00:53 - Michael’s iPhone
So that almost never happens.
00:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that was fun. So I'm just, I'm a little disoriented.
00:01:00 - Michael’s iPhone
to the one getting everything back up uh Mark said he hoped you got your GT4 yeah we yeah yeah it should be coming on Thursday oh okay um let's have you what's the progress on assistance or chef or anything like that oh so we found uh we found a home assistant personal it's like a task person and also to watch Mari so she's gonna come Monday through Friday from 8 to 12 or 7 30 to 12 and what we believe is that'll help us return Amazon stuff do shopping at Whole Foods our weekly uh returning things dropping you know is to UPS to kind of the tasks and then also when Esther's super tired we're gonna give her Mari for the morning and then she'll bottle feed Mari for the 8 o'clock and the 11 o'clock feeds and then let Esther sleep in or just do whatever she needs to do and then at 12 o'clock Esther will take over as usual for the rest of the day and yeah and then I usually come back and finish work about five so I'll take over or help out at five so we're gonna start there I love that plan my stinking AI note taker is also not letting me highlight so I just want to make sure I get that so 12 o'clock to noon um yeah we're gonna do it above board too you know a lot of them we want to just cash and I you know I'm in position where I don't really feel like I want to do that and risk that so we're just gonna do it above board we're paying her 35 an hour which is a premium but yes but then uh then we could do it above board pair, like a normal W2, like legally, we're supposed to, and then be done with it. Because yeah, I think I could find a cheaper person, like 25 30, but they all wanted cash. And I was like, I don't want to risk that, you get hurt, and then you sue me. Yes.
00:03:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But also, it doesn't, I, have you considered 1099 instead of W2?
00:03:21 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, we looked at, I actually, we have an employment lawyer, and we talked about it. But if they're coming to my house, it's pretty much W2. Unless they're doing tasks like cooking, specific cleaning, but if it's like, every morning, eight to 12, like on a schedule, and it's, uh, it's tough.
00:03:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, the schedule.
00:03:39 - Michael’s iPhone
It's only, it's, it's excuse us that that becomes an issue. But I was just like, I don't even want to, don't want to go in that. Yeah.
00:03:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And are you hiring her as an LLC or like a corporation?
00:03:54 - Michael’s iPhone
That's kind of a personal corporation. It's weird. Like, yeah, I set it up through Poppins payroll, so they specialize in
00:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
housekeeper payroll well what I'm asking is like are you using the are you minimizing liability as much as possible in your corporate structure no is that something that you consider maybe wanting to do that's a good point you mean like corporation hire yeah I mean even just an LLC is still you don't have to deal with unemployment you don't have to deal with any of that stuff although if you're doing W2 that's probably financially the best way to organize it in terms of protection from getting sued especially if that corporation solely exists for home operations type stuff rather than you know any of your other business so that its assets are minimized the her ability to sue you is minimized But also, you have to pay unemployment with W2. You have to do all of those things anyway. So an S-Corp really isn't gonna add any more burden, but it should give you some more protection. And also, there are things that you can do to protect your money and an S-Corp that you can't do and other things like hiring the kids, paying that type of stuff.
00:05:23 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, we already passed through one of the Corps. So yeah, actually, maybe if we made it sort of like an executive bonus. I'm gonna look into my accountant. Actually, that's a really good point. Maybe if we put another layer of liability besides just the work of insurance.
00:05:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thanks, y'all, look at that. Every week, I'm gonna look for a way to be valuable.
00:05:44 - Michael’s iPhone
We'll try. I hadn't even thought of it. Yeah, because what I had talked to my accountant was like, hey, can I use business expenses to pay for this? And they're like, no, that's sketchy, like, don't do that. But if we're doing it for liability, we're essentially, we're giving the childcare, you know, as a executive perk to me and Esther. Yeah, but not trying to claim a tax deduction. I think that would be in just for essentially liability.
00:06:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, let me ask. That's great. Thanks. And also that, to the point of the type of people that you want to have in your life, having somebody who is good at wealth management and wealth advice, there's a big difference between accounting and wealth management. So the difference between multi-millionaires and billionaires think very, very differently. So anyway, something to keep in mind. All right, let's write that down. Okay, so 12th noon, you rattled off the task from me really quick.
00:06:42 - Michael’s iPhone
I would really like them one more time if you don't mind. Yeah, so she's going to work from 8 or 7.30 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. So the biggest things is like the weekly or by week or twice a week grocery shopping, returning Amazon things to Whole Foods or UPS stores. dropping off packages we want to send to UPS, USGS, or FedEx, and doing just random, you know, we need diapers, please go to Target, you know, stuff that we can't easily order online. So those are like the tasks. And then, under that house cleaning, she's going to do, we're going to have the housekeeper continue coming every other week. But she's going to do maintenance of the dishes in the kitchen, which is what Ester and I were driving us crazy. So she's going to do the dishes in the kitchen. She's going to help us with the laundry. I want to say my laundry because I have more than Ester and, you know, washing and folding my laundry and, you know, a light bathroom cleaning around mostly the toilets. And then, as a backup, if Ester's tired, she's going to have bottle seed Mari for the morning and just focus on Mari for the morning.
00:07:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. how did you find her?
00:07:59 - Michael’s iPhone
do you know about that? The value is like let's just explore that conversation a little bit so I'm familiar with it. Yeah, so I just started asking my neighbors, hey, you know, we're looking for a housekeeper, do you guys know anything? And then this lady actually came to our attention because she babysits our next next door neighbors to kids. She's been doing it for five years. And now they're both going to school in the morning, so she has no work in the morning. So they said, hey, you know, it'd be perfect if you guys took her in the morning and then, you know, obviously we'll do like normally act. so we had to talk with her Esther and then me and then also my my mom, my grandma was very skeptical. So we all talked to her and then we're actually going to talk to the my neighbor today little later today. going get on the call and just kind of bet her a little more. But yeah, that's that was kind of a process.
00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it hasn't started yet, but you're you're right there making that decision.
00:08:59 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, September 1st is when. And the kids at school starts when she'll have time to start with us permanently.
00:09:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's a very good day. That's the day Tina was born.
00:09:07 - Michael’s iPhone
So I put good blessing. Nine one in 1991, right?
00:09:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nineteen seventy six year of the dragon.
00:09:16 - Michael’s iPhone
I have no shame.
00:09:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I earned every strike. Every strike. Um, OK, so how will she roughly?
00:09:28 - Michael’s iPhone
Does she have kids? She's two kids there in Guatemala. They're fully grown. Actually, I'm sorry, they're in San Diego. They've brought their families from Guatemala. Her kids are in San Diego.
00:09:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so how old are the kids that she was babysitting?
00:09:49 - Michael’s iPhone
Four and six, I believe now. Four and seven, something like that.
00:09:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And what kind of family are your neighbors?
00:10:00 - Michael’s iPhone
Two lawyers, they're two stay at home lawyers.
00:10:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so the reason I'm asking is because it speaks to level of expectations. You know what I mean? If people in certain industries, you already know there's going to be a certain level of competence required, ability to communicate, ability to work autonomously. Generally speaking, higher level professions have low tolerance for stupid mistakes, especially on repeat. True. Right, so if they're both attorneys, even if they're not the most high-performing, there's a certain amount of effort you have to do just to get through a law school and medical school, right? So the odds that she's highly incompetent, or you know what I mean? Just because somebody refers you, somebody doesn't mean it's a good referral, but similar ages, similar neighborhood, which is going to be similar of a sort, income levels. You know what I mean?
00:11:01 - Michael’s iPhone
There's so many things that go into that So that's super hopeful and I'd like We've actually seen her at like the park with the two kids before like I've seen her multiple times that like the parks and Yeah, so every time I've seen her like she's not on the phone. She's not like texting, know She's always like watching the kids.
00:11:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that Yeah, that was a big thing too.
00:11:26 - Michael’s iPhone
We we had seen her. I so that's why we're gonna talk to the lawyer the owner today because We don't know how she's you know in the house Seen her in the house. I've only seen her in the park. Um, yeah, and what you have nanny cams We we thought about that we haven't Because mostly because estu is gonna be in the house kind of like the lawyers work Um, but yeah, we're thinking of that Well, um most of the services have apps and you can have sketch
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
tools where you can turn things on and off. So privacy mode, like if you only want it to be on during the hours that she's there, do a little research first and find something that you can just schedule beyond during this time. If you don't want the footage, you can save it to a cloud or an SD card so that it's not in the cloud and your privacy is your privacy, that type of but, you know, when it comes to your children, safety, things like that, something to consider. Also liability, if anything ever happens, you've got evidence and nobody wants to be that person, nobody wants to think about that, but after the fact is too late. Also, we all tend to be on better behavior when we know we're being watched and it doesn't matter or cause an effect, chicken and egg, it doesn't matter. Whatever draws us out to be better people draws us out to be better people.
00:12:54 - Michael’s iPhone
So it's like the switch, it's like switch, the housekeeper to know, like make it easier for her. to be on her best behavior, right? Like, that's what the book talked about is like, yeah, like, who knows if it's forcing her or it's like, you know, whatever, it doesn't matter. Like, the end result is she's going to be a little bit better because she is being watched. Like, yeah, I like that.
00:13:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ah, look at that. We're applying switch.
00:13:20 - Michael’s iPhone
I like your book. I'm going to read that book. Like you said, it's short. I think I'm going to, I will read it four times because it's just a very, like, basic, easy to understand, like, makes sense concepts. And, yeah, I'm going to read it four because it's anecdotal, the stories pop out in your head.
00:13:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, that's the thing that's been amazing to me. I only read it once. I should go back and reread it. But I, the details of the stories that pop in my head and how frequently they do, I reference it probably several times a year. There's only a few books that I do that, which you would think it'd be more than that. But I can't say that about most books or anything that I've read. a single source that has multiple applications and that's one of them so that's why I don't recommend a ton of books but I gave one a mark today also that I haven't read for like 12 years probably called EMIF and that would be good for you to read as well I just think it's a good overall business book but it is about structure I have read that I think I have read that book it has like a really a lot of words on the cover it's like the EMIF yeah I read that I don't remember what the premise was it was about sales it was more about how many structure and maturity and menu items so for example you can't go to McDonald's and order a filet mignon because even if they wanted to go to the store get it for you and you said you were going to pay him $200 to do they're not going to be good at it you don't know what you're going to get because that's not what they do over and over again, but they want to be the best at what they have. So these are the limited items yet. Right.
00:15:08 - Michael’s iPhone
Was it even mastery or something?
00:15:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Revisited.
00:15:12 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. Yeah. haven't read that. Yeah. That's what it was.
00:15:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Even if revisited. Okay.
00:15:17 - Michael’s iPhone
That's great. I'll pick that up and get it on book on tape. I do remember I liked it a lot. I don't remember. Yeah.
00:15:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then also talk about IBM. I think that was e-book, Emeth and they talk about org charts and that IBM was kind of unique in that it was born as a mature company. So it talks about companies from teens or like newborn stages and then beginner right and then teenage and then a mature company. And a mature company has SOPs has an org chart. It has all of these things, very specific functions, very specific seats and roles that perform each of those functions. functions and that type of thing. And it has been so long, so I have to go back and ask myself what I will.
00:16:05 - Michael’s iPhone
I will already totally read it.
00:16:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, it's okay. You don't have to do I do. I need to because because it is one of those ones that I it's a it's a staple. There are certain staples that that I like to reference. And it's because they're foundational concepts like switch those concepts. You can use them for almost every type of decision that you have to make that is high impact, right? Who you hire, how you hire, how you choose your how much time you're going to work, where you're going to work, that type of thing. Because it gives you a structural concept framework to run your decisions through. So switch does that.
00:16:59 - Michael’s iPhone
And think no, no, I'll really. For sure, I do remember it.
00:17:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, okay, okay, so I'm excited.
00:17:05 - Michael’s iPhone
I forgot Yay, I love it. I love it when people are excited and they when I read over and over it is Peter Teal is zero to one It's about like starting a new business or thinking about like a product that you want off That's the one I've read like price five times now That's the one but but it has like the same thing like you're saying and like switch very simple concepts Like things like a checklist to go through in my mind. Like is this even a good idea, you know, so okay?
00:17:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'll do that. I love that love that Okay, so we're starting off with an assistant and she is going to tackle dishes every day Yeah, through Friday Right. Well, that's what I meant.
00:17:49 - Michael’s iPhone
Sorry Monday through Friday The hard thing that Esther and I talked about is like Esther doesn't like leaving the kitchen dirty at night And so we're trying to like she thinks she would be okay and we're trying it for like a week because it's just very foreign to her like you've stuck in the kitchen sink overnight so yeah but she has just very skill like but I think yes just come around she's like let me try it you know we'll try it for two weeks see if I could like handle that she doesn't like going to sleep with the kitchen and mess I mean I get it but you know if you know help is coming in the morning that I feel like maybe we can try it and see and something that you can help her with this is is it because you know that in the morning you're gonna have to face that duty and you don't want to start your day thinking with that that is on your on your plate so it isn't that there are dishes in the sink it's that there are dishes in the sink that you have to deal with first thing in the morning or look at all day so if you because yeah no I actually talked to her but I did I asked her the question it was because in childhood she would get that she didn't have a great childhood she who would get yelled at if things weren't aligned. So now she makes sure things are aligned. That's the reason. And she even said, I get it. That's my reasoning. But it's hard to break that and go to sleep with that purpose.
00:19:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For that purpose, maybe ask her to commit to just 30 days. 30 days, draw how she feels progressively. But here's the thing. Our decisions should feed our values because of our priorities. Our priorities are from our values, not someone else's. And so the way to loosen ourselves from the past is to break the responses that we have as a result of them. So if it was really Esther's vow. use rather than a fear response. Um, that wouldn't have been what she said.
00:20:06 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. So she's still she's still making it about a fear response rather than about her own.
00:20:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is to not give it any power anymore.
00:20:18 - Michael’s iPhone
So I like to practice taking the power away from dishes shouldn't have that power over her. That's right. I like that.
00:20:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She needs your coaching. I'm here. Um, but we can do this. But this is, this is why I talk about the holistic approach stuff. Because yeah, she can help her.
00:20:41 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah. If she could make that like if I could just put like a little bit of a carrot and be like, Hey, why don't you focus on your values? What do you want? Do you want the dishes to hold that power of fear over you? And if I could just get her just a little switch try it for 30 days, then it'll make our lives better at night. could focus on the kids at night instead of, you know, washing dishes.
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
for 45 minutes.
00:21:01 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, you know, we might cook more right because you don't cook because we're so afraid of all the plate, you know, the pots and pans, so like that might be better. So yeah, I love this. I'll give her just that little nugget and see if she'll try it for 30 days and then see if it makes her feel better.
00:21:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Great. So there's one more additional power in that because if you take that fear that came from the past. And if she's able to, you know, loosen its power, what other things is she's still doing because of childhood wounds? And what other hold can be broken? So because if you learn that you can break a hold, then you learn that you can break all the holes. Okay, yeah. I'll look around.
00:21:52 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah. And she's a wonderful person. Like she actually goes to therapy, she works on the different, you know, she knows she has. as bad things and she works on them and you know she believes that some people don't think they can change but she believes she can change so yeah it's been really good.
00:22:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's amazing but the other thing is our partners see things differently than us and we can't see all the things all the time and you can't do all the things all the time so this is where leverage comes in what are those things that have the greatest amount of power for good or bad so in our business in our lives we want to create the powerful levers but we need to undo the bad lovers the one that if I go to bed and the dishes are in there that I could have a bad night's sleep that I could wake up bad because of dishes now I like a clean house I I the energy my productivity my happiness is very much tied to it but having had four kids and being single and running a business and doing all of those things I had to let certain things go and and I got help, you know, around the house and learned it. But I have to let, I can let things go in the moment. So my overall value of cleanliness has not diminished, but the power that I give it when it's out of alignment for the moment is also diminished, because I'm like, it will be solved. I have a system in place to solve it. I don't need to worry about you. You take no more mental space.
00:23:25 - Michael’s iPhone
So anyway. Yeah, I love that.
00:23:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Astronies you. I'm I'm looking for about two or three more clients to be full, especially as we're going into fall, because I want to be dizzier when my girls, they don't need me as much anymore. They're teenagers like growing up and they're moving out. And I'm like, I need to take care of other people. So if you know somebody, let me know. OK, so we'll get into your sleep stuff. But this is a pivotal thing. Can you guys hire this person?
00:23:56 - Michael’s iPhone
OK, so let me know. think so too. I'm really like, I don't like to hope a whole lot, but like I'm like, man, I think if everything checks out with her background within, you know, the old, the lawyer that I'm going to talk to, and I'm really like, man, this could be great. So, yeah, we'll see. I'll let you know in September.
00:24:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Optimism is powerful.
00:24:17 - Michael’s iPhone
It's powerful. It's good.
00:24:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've learned to be cautiously optimistic, but I used to try to hold back my optimism, because a lot of things wouldn't go the way that I wanted to. But instead, what I've shifted that to is instead of holding the expectation specifically of it will be this way, my expectation is it will be improved and it will be better. Because of the specific thing that I did, or because something else revealed itself along the way, or because I failed at this part and I learned and I'm a step closer to actually doing it right. Either way, I lose. And so there's nothing to not be optimistic about because I'm a step closer.
00:25:00 - Michael’s iPhone
Regardless, I think I think like that almost about everything too optimistic, but yeah, that's how I think of it too Relined Okay, okay, so watching folding that's it.
00:25:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a huge amount of stuff I'm super excited about that because we haven't really gotten to the business stuff yet But we came in with a baby and pending now the big is here now.
00:25:24 - Michael’s iPhone
There's there's tiredness and exhaustion Sorry, I'm in your meeting right now. I know I have a good day.
00:25:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice to see you again All right, anyway, so we always have to take seasons into account.
00:25:38 - Michael’s iPhone
Are you I wasn't gonna go to jujitsu because I was like, oh, I got I had the meeting with Tina And then I was like, no, this is what Tina wanted to like, let's get out and do what I Early Yeah
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yes, yes, that is fantastic. Um, so how has my energy right now?
00:26:06 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, it's been great. I love this port. Oh, it's just so good.
00:26:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, it's just, yeah, I love it. to me about how often you've been going, like, has there been an increase in frequency? Um, just just give me a little more detail.
00:26:21 - Michael’s iPhone
Well, the baby's been tough, but I think, uh, last Monday, I started going, again, I'm trying to go three times a week. So like Monday, Wednesday, Saturday or Monday, Wednesday, Sunday, it's just every week's different. So I've been trying to go at least three times a week. So oh, it's just great. Yeah. Glad we paid for access. This was wonderful. Best $200 I've spent.
00:26:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that you phrased it that way.
00:26:47 - Michael’s iPhone
love that you phrased it that way.
00:26:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
told me to.
00:26:50 - Michael’s iPhone
like that. I know.
00:26:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know. But just because, just because I did that doesn't mean that that stuck in your mind and that because when you say it, you give it your own. on power. It's not because I said it. It's because you bought into it and now it becomes yours.
00:27:05 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, I would pay $50 a class to choke someone out.
00:27:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thanks. I think I need to do it too. I'm just a lot more calm everywhere when I do get a little, you know, rustling out of me. Yes. to that point, hold on, let me make sure I want to write that down. We talked about energy sandwiches a little bit when you've got some stressful things or you've got those like back-to-back meetings and things just jumping down and knocking out some push-ups or something to get attention out.
00:27:42 - Michael’s iPhone
Has that ever come up yet? I've been working so little the last two weeks. I really haven't done much work in general. Tomorrow, would say Monday. start working on Wednesday. So Wednesday will be, I'll be working again. So yeah, I mean, the things that I have got done, like the mission critical stuff, it's not really bothersome to me. It's like 20 minutes here, 20 minutes there, and then I get it done. But I haven't really tried to enter just that one yet.
00:28:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's cool. And really, like I said, I think the foundational piece is, and we have to sleep yet, but we'll get to sleep. But is getting your home situation, like you just entered the new season. It's not just two kids, but it's infant all over again.
00:28:35 - Michael’s iPhone
So yeah, this is very, very very Like our, I could already see like our time is gonna be, well, maybe not so much me actually, but Esther's time's gonna be vastly different. So there's a couple things on her business that I'm gonna probably pick up the slack on a little bit, you know, to help her because, yeah, now this is gonna be, it's gonna be all hands on deck for her for the next six not so. Yep, is what it is.
00:29:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so that I understand where your brain is going, what type of work would you be doing?
00:29:12 - Michael’s iPhone
On the Q and E work.
00:29:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I said, okay, when you say Esther stuff, then you mean in your business?
00:29:19 - Michael’s iPhone
Well, Esther runs her own billing company.
00:29:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She bills for my Q and E work, but we segment it. Got it.
00:29:27 - Michael’s iPhone
And so there's, there are things that I'm totally, I just shut off. I'm just black and white. I'm like, nope, that's, that's the billing company. That's hers and her manager. And I don't think about it at all. Literally, I walk into my Q and E. I interview the guy. I write my report. I send it to them. They take care of the rest. But now I think there are things I'm going to step in that she was doing that I'm just going to pick up a little bit more slack on. And just help out a little part.
00:29:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And before the baby, how many hours a week was as
00:30:00 - Michael’s iPhone
So working in her business roughly for she did she did a meeting on Tuesday, one on Friday, like an hour, maybe hour to a paperwork, but she has a wonderful manager, okay, you know, in the manager, a pretty good premium to be our manager. Basically, take everything off Esther's plate. The thing that Esther still has to do is just little things that are just very ownership related, I think. Okay.
00:30:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the manager can't help you with that type of stuff in for QME?
00:30:35 - Michael’s iPhone
Well, that's, that's what I'm going to, I'm going to help the manager do a little more. But like, I want my wording a certain way. And so that's the part I'm going to step in and like work with the manager instead of Esther and the manager on doing.
00:30:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Watch it.
00:30:59 - Michael’s iPhone
All right. my wording for how you can't advertise what I do legally, but I can say, I've done this, I've done this work, I've done this kind of case, as you could say, the truth. You just can't say, I'm the best, I will, know. So that's the point.
00:31:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One of the things that you could do to just just a thought, and it is just a this, not that document?
00:31:22 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
00:31:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Make that very clear. Okay. Yeah. Because if you give examples, and if you give enough examples so that she can understand this language evokes liability, this one doesn't. This one is a claim.
00:31:40 - Michael’s iPhone
is a statement. You know what I mean?
00:31:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. evidence based, that type of thing. So that's the point.
00:32:00 - Michael’s iPhone
is what helps somebody be able to see the correlation.
00:32:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if she's intelligent enough, if this is not that type of thing, we should be more helpful. Love it. Yeah, that's something simple. And then astronaut can work on that too. I could just talk to Esther about it. And then yeah, I can come up with that.
00:32:17 - Michael’s iPhone
That's great. Yeah. Okay, cool.
00:32:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Again, always leverage.
00:32:22 - Michael’s iPhone
whatever we can do to find some leverage and optimize the little things that you do, then you've got more mental effort for the big things. Big rocks, right? Yep, that makes sense. Okay, let me...
00:32:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so did you start using the Food Journal app yet?
00:32:38 - Michael’s iPhone
Yep, I believe I sent it to you. Tina at Profit.
00:32:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I documented it through Sunday. Okay, hold on a second.
00:32:50 - Michael’s iPhone
And separately, I sent the weekly report to your email.
00:32:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know which one you prefer, but I sent the Dailys and the weekly. You should only have one email from me, I think, but...
00:33:02 - Michael’s iPhone
As Tina, I imported it to Tina at Profit Drivers. that's me.
00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a user report. Okay.
00:33:02 - Michael’s iPhone
Um, all right. Well, that's good. So that's in macros. Let's take a look at this. And then I was shocked. Like, I thought I over eat all the time. Esther thinks I underneath, but I was shocked that like, I'm pretty close to 2000, whatever that limit is that 2000 calories a day.
00:33:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, yeah, but do you know what your BMR is? I don't know what the BMR is. Basic metabolic rate. Like what? No idea.
00:33:29 - Michael’s iPhone
Burn on average per day.
00:33:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they calculated it by your age, height, your weight. I'm not even sure if height is in it, but that's what I put in there.
00:33:40 - Michael’s iPhone
And then that's what they said, like whatever that number is 2000. Okay.
00:33:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what's your, oh, your budget is 2020.
00:33:44 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay.
00:33:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you're not trying to wait a minute. Correct. Okay. I'm trying to.
00:33:50 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. So then that's, that's probably what that is. That's very low.
00:33:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm a hundred and twenty two pounds. So it's a fairly low. That makes sense. Okay. Um, but what is your activity level? Like I would think that you're more active than you would need more calories than that because of Jiu-Jitsu.
00:34:09 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, actually you could see that like on the days that I did Jiu-Jitsu, I actually think I ate more that like I had a snack because I was just like dying.
00:34:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if you're actually under a little bit, but maybe not. So, and sometimes it comes down to macros and digestion and body energy, whatever. the whole, the whole point of it is just getting some more and I shouldn't end just seeing. So let me look at that.
00:34:38 - Michael’s iPhone
sounds great. never done that before, but I started tracking and I was like, oh, okay, I guess I am pretty close to the 2000 thing.
00:34:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I think your protein is low.
00:34:49 - Michael’s iPhone
And protein is low.
00:34:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because on average, just to maintain your muscle level and your weight. I would. say you probably need at least 100 grams of protein every day. So it's only a little bit under because you're averaging. Well, it should be, that would be, wait, seven days, yeah, 700, and you're at 663 for the week. So probably a little bit under, but we were already talking about more protein and probably you sleep at night. Unless it was fat and protein, because the things that you were eating weren't just high on protein, but they were also high in fat hot dogs, pizza. What was the other thing that comes? yeah, yeah, yeah, saturated fat specifically, which we definitely don't want to have more of. But I don't know what is the concoction that's helping you sleep better. Was it was it the protein? Was it fat? Was it protein and fat? So that's something to start really looking at is what is your, what is your your last meal of the day? So these are macros. That's helpful. I would really like to see the mark. specifically of the last meal of the day. And you can look at that in the log, go lose it. Dash or let's see, no log. Okay, so dinner, if you click on the dinner, let's say, go to yesterday's dinner.
00:36:21 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay.
00:36:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if you click on it, you should be able to see all.
00:36:30 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, view meal summary. There it is, new meal summary.
00:36:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yeah. So we want that just every day, and then we'll make a correlation of that between sleep. want to look at everything overall, too, so we can just kind of see when you do start making some changes, just what it kind of has an impact on your, like, brain fog sleep performance mood. Yeah, but, but that last meal of the day. So let's go look at. your sleep stuff.
00:37:03 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh yeah did you do I so I changed the document the old ones called outdated and I put a new one called spreadsheet.
00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm quite proud of it I think it looks a lot better. Okay. Do you report weekly report? Was it no that's not the weekly report. Let me just I'm just gonna forward it because I'm looking under use specifically and I don't see it. There it goes. I came through.
00:37:41 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah that didn't come through.
00:37:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
for whatever reason I didn't come through before. look at that restful sleep. That seems like it's improved.
00:38:01 - Michael’s iPhone
Well, that's because Esther this week started letting me miss the two evening feeds, so that's what I've been getting a chunk of restful sleep.
00:38:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but your first week, like before the baby came, this is even better than that.
00:38:18 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, that's that.
00:38:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is, I mean, let's go to outdated. Shush, see if I have the original slide, whoops, the first one, yeah, oh, that was an apple lot, because the first week you didn't have that, and we're tracks differently. So I don't have apples to compare, but either way, let me. I do like this better. Why is it better? don't know, but it looks better. I can see everything. That's why. Good job. I put it bar.
00:39:14 - Michael’s iPhone
I put like the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. But it's actually weird because Monday is actually looking at Sunday night sleep. Right. It's like baby for sleep. I remember that.
00:39:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:39:27 - Michael’s iPhone
So. Is there a way to look better now?
00:39:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:39:30 - Michael’s iPhone
Thank you. I'm quite proud of Good job.
00:39:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Somewhat rested. Oh, good. tagged how you felt. That's good. And that would be helpful to review too.
00:39:42 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, no. That's not antagonizing.
00:39:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the sleep tracker assumption. Oh, okay.
00:39:49 - Michael’s iPhone
Um. What is the app you told me?
00:39:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sleep watchers. Yeah. It does have a function to where you can set it to ask you how rested you felt. felt during the day or how fatigued you felt, so I don't remember what the language is, but I think it's fatigued.
00:40:07 - Michael’s iPhone
I'm just very happy these last three weeks. I've actually worn my ordering, worn my Apple watch to get the data. So yeah, it's getting incrementally better on our data. Okay, I'll try to I'll try to enable how like how do I feel when I wake up?
00:40:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not just how you feel when you wake up, but how do you feel middle of the day? Okay, good.
00:40:34 - Michael’s iPhone
I'm sorry, in the journal, I was making notes of that. Sorry, you out again. Oh, I was noting some of that in my journal vlogs. My daily journal.
00:40:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did I have a really hard time writing?
00:40:58 - Michael’s iPhone
Sorry.
00:40:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see. Oh, It's a little bit better though, but it's also it's hard to go through that and find just the specific things that I'm looking for. So if you open your sleepwatch app, let me, let see what this says, sleep. There is a, let's see, is it for the setting, the course?
00:41:24 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, you know what? It's funny now that I open it. so I don't open this app every day. only open it when I send you the documents. Oh, okay. So actually, it literally, right now, it's just like, how well rested did you feel?
00:41:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, okay, I'll start welling this in. Okay. Yeah. maybe I'll have it allow notifications. Because that will be the thing that will pop up in the middle of day. How fatigued are you? Okay.
00:41:57 - Michael’s iPhone
Allow notifications.
00:41:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it. I'll think of it. Yeah. I'll play around with little. That's the whole thing, right? That's the iterations of it's a little bit here, a little bit there. So we're going to get the, let me just get back to my notes. So we need evening, macro, log reports, added to the...
00:42:23 - Michael’s iPhone
So maybe the best way for that is to take a screenshot, because I don't know, but I don't can get it. don't know if get all that way. Yep, screenshot would be perfect.
00:42:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
okay. And we don't have to do this forever, but a few weeks of figuring out, okay, what is all the data that's pertinent? What is the report that's giving us the pertinent data? Review it for a while, make some changes, and then, you know, do this exercise again in a few months and see how you're doing. Or... or if an issue pops up, or if you're like, I'm actually sticking really good, all these things are good, then we wanna go look and go, okay, what was the thing? So we're not gonna be digging into this, like this deep for such a long time. We're basically getting a baseline right now, making a very small plan for whatever you want to do, right? Cause you don't wanna have like a diet overall or anything like that. So this is just data, and then knowing what are the things that impact you? So when you're like, I need to do something different, this is not working, then you know what things are gonna have an impact on it. Okay. I like it. All right. I'm so excited that you found somebody.
00:43:40 - Michael’s iPhone
You don't get to start till September. I know. She said, you know, we could do some trial runs with her on the weekends and give Esther wants to get out. So we might actually do that and just trial runs or something. What about if in the meantime, you have your cleaner come every week? Yeah. Yeah, we've talked. to about that. This goes back to the thing I we don't really like our cleaner and Mark actually suggested. Yeah she's just a little, well I talked to I actually talked to Mark about this and our house is like little bit larger so there's a lot and Mark was saying maybe make like you know like that list you were saying for my manager or the feeling like Mark was saying why don't you make a list like that for your cleaners so it's like do this at minimum and then at least we'll be like happy yeah because right now she misses the window like not the window sills but when you open a window she misses the inner groove and Mark was like yeah but for a 3000 square foot house like unfortunately you're probably gonna have to tell her to like hit that so I was like okay so yeah that's maybe that's another thing I'll work on I'll talk to Esther about leaving the dishes till tomorrow and then also I'll work with her on creating a list for the cleaner and see if it works. And if it does, then we can increase it.
00:45:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because that's just like, I don't want to pay this person every week. I'm just like, OK.
00:45:08 - Michael’s iPhone
And you can change it every week.
00:45:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I have my cleaning list. It's just a Google Doc.
00:45:16 - Michael’s iPhone
And oh, you have a list.
00:45:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can I have it?
00:45:18 - Michael’s iPhone
I mean, it probably wouldn't be relevant to you because I have a working on.
00:45:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So she also is great at organizing like a Marie Kondo type thing. And so I've got her working on projects plus my baseline cleaning because I also have two teenage girls that want money from me. So they've got to earn it. So our doctors are going to be super different. But what I do is I tell her, OK, these are the things that need to get done monthly. These are the things that need to get done quarterly. And then here are the weekly projects. These are the must-dos. So if you're running low on energy or time or whatever, these are the things you must-do first.
00:45:56 - Michael’s iPhone
Or I'm not going to be happy. OK.
00:45:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. But thanks.
00:46:01 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah.
00:46:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But then she has to go update the report and she'll tell me what she got done and anything that she noticed. if I'm out of the cleaning supply, if something took longer because there was an issue or she noticed something that I wasn't aware of, so put that in the report and then also confirm the amount of time that it's worked. So, you know, like if she leaves early, I want to know if she works longer, I want to know whatever that type of thing. So, yeah. So we've got the cleaning and then we've got the project that you know you don't get to the projects until the cleaning is done.
00:46:39 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay.
00:46:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cool. Yes.
00:46:42 - Michael’s iPhone
Yes.
00:46:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's the thing, the documentation and any type of business or where there's an expectation of another person that's working for you. It just helps. First of all, it's a paper trail. It's clear. expectations. And in a Google Doc, you can view the history. So let's say somebody goes and like, oops, I deleted it. Well, you've got version history. You can go back and see every version of the document ever. So you can say, well, she said, Oh, well, it didn't say that then. What day was that? Let me go back and check.
00:47:19 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, actually, yes, it did. It said it on that day.
00:47:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you know, it's accountability. And that goes back to the nanny cam and help people do their best. So, but it makes you be accountable. And this is the thing I was talking to you about before, making sure that you're being a good leader and a good boss by being clear. And so if the documentation says, which he didn't really tell me what I needed to do, he said this, this was not very clear. He said this and this is going to take three hours. And I did this because I only had two. So this doesn't make any sense, right? then now we know there's a communication issue and nobody addressed it. So who owns that? Does she own it? Do you own it? That type of thing. So, Oh, anyway, it's a, it's a hard process.
00:48:03 - Michael’s iPhone
I'm excited.
00:48:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This would be great.
00:48:05 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. think we're going to make a big difference, didn't you? Yeah, we've been meeting to do that list, like Mark said, but I think it's more specific list. That'd be great. We'll do it.
00:48:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that goes back to big rocks. First things first. So the big rock is, is, is really that the communication is clear and the expectations are clear. Because almost always when there's an offense or a problem, it's because expectations weren't meant. And usually when expectations are met, it's because expectations weren't clearly set in the first place thoroughly in all encompassing.
00:48:45 - Michael’s iPhone
Please make that a note. Esther has been telling me that for years and I agree, like when I lose my , that's exactly what Esther tells me. she's like, did you set the expectations for your person that you're frustrated? I'm like, no. Oh, but it's a common thing I you hit a nail on a head right there and please remember to keep challenging me when you sense frustration about Something just as we work together. Um, yeah, please know that's a huge problem. I have and I am trying to work on it, but What you just said when I get frustrated, I should probably turn inwards and be like, did I send my expectations right? they know how to please me? Yeah. Um, But great point.
00:49:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
good. need to do that. Yeah, yeah and um Another thought as I've been working on my like psychology. Did you agree? I'm like, man, I think we always have to be learning I wish everybody was learning because we just sometimes just get really complacent but um Just understanding what the mechanics of certain things are anxiety is basically the fear of the unknown That leads into expectations, right? If expectations aren't clearly said, I don't even know how I can satisfy them, do you know what I mean? So, think about working for somebody who you want to please and you ask them what they want and they told you and the tone that they use is, okay, this conversation is done and I'm going to tell you, you have that tone, I plow through it. It's not a bad thing, but you're like, the way that, okay, so if I do this, oh yeah, okay, that makes sense and I'm leaning in and I'm looking you and I'm pausing, there's potentially room to continue the conversation, right? You're like, oh yeah, that makes sense. What does that mean? How would you read that?
00:50:48 - Michael’s iPhone
I'd be like, okay, well the next time you do it, you better do it exactly right, otherwise there's going to be an issue there.
00:50:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Most people, and especially in a subordinate position. would take that as you just wave me off this is done you physically you physically make a signal a subordinate is most of them are going to take that as a that was dismissed this conversation probably should be over they don't want to hear more about it I have to watch when I do that and it's not necessarily a bad thing it's okay moving on but it is very much a signal of moving on when you're working especially with women first of all generally speaking they have to be very good at body language and signals women are raised differently but but you you learn you learn the environment you learn where you fit in what you're to do and women tend to just fall in line with that. So when I've been trying to hire and train assistants and autonomous leaders, I have to get them to push past those signals. And it takes years to do. And not all of them can do it. here's the crazy thing. It takes years to do, even with their boss, right here, saying yes, please tell me what to do. Yes, please probe. Yes, please hold me accountable. Yes, please ask me why I didn't do what I said I was going to do. Even with that, it takes a couple of years to get them to do it. And even still, they're like, I feel like I'm being bad. feel like I'm being pushy. feel like I'm being bitchy. feel like I'm, you know, like, and it's annoying people. So.
00:52:52 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, I got, I, I'll watch that next time I talk to, uh, I'm not going to have a conversation by manager today, actually, so. Well, we do it on the phone, but yeah, I'm sure there's signals that I give them on the phone room like, okay, done. Let's go. What are we doing next?
00:53:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's not really true. So what that you could do is just go, was there anything else you wanted to talk about that now? Okay. I'm also big on call control. I don't want it repeated. If you've told me the same thing twice, I don't want to hear it again. I don't, I got it the first time. And so I'm not telling you it's a bad thing. And I do the same thing, but I have to be aware of, okay, I have to catch myself in it and go, did I hear what you needed to tell me? Did we address the issue in full? Are you clear? Am I clear? If we're clear, let's move on. We don't need to keep talking about it. But if you're not clear, then, and I'm your boss, then I need to sit there until you get clear. So here's the other aspect of it. If you can't get clear quickly, and you frequently can't, get clear quickly, you got to go. I got to replace you.
00:54:03 - Michael’s iPhone
Interesting. Interesting. You know, yeah, okay. Yeah, you know, when my manager, we get clear real quick with him. And I feel like we're on the same page, but some of the people we've hired that he managed is when I talked to them, I'm like, and I think that probably drives my body language when I talked to them because I'm like, okay, we said it, let's go, but it always takes me. Yeah, I'm just like, I don't know if we got it.
00:54:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know that. So, yeah, interesting. But but but then you have to ask yourself what's the talent pool possible that somebody can meet me at this level with what I'm willing to pay them. So then you have to decide what is the Are you going to take that amount of time every single time you have to get clear with them? Or are you going to go pay two, three, times as much? So you've got somebody who's just going and doing the thing. So there's always trade-offs. You just want to be consciously making sure that you've made the choice and then be in it because you're dealing with people. So if you have to explain concepts and it takes somebody three or four times longer than you want it to, but once they get it, they get it and they do the job, they're reliable, they're loyal, you know, they're lot of them. Then that is a trade-off that you consciously and willingly make and then you need to tell yourself, okay, I just got to calm down, sit back. Once you've gone through this, like, are you clear? And then you can practice, how do you get clear? What do they need? That makes it more clear. Do they need visuals? Because in your mind, here's the other thing. I haven't said this to anybody for a long time because I keep my clients along, that I don't have to train new people, but a lot of times people have more than half of the conversation going on in their head and only like 20% of it comes out. So you've got a full picture of what you want going on here and you've given instructions and they hear the instructions, but they don't see the whole picture. So that's where lists, examples, not that type of thing is helpful because now you've helped them get a picture and maybe they can't fully see the picture of what it is, but they can see a picture of what it's not because you gave examples.
00:56:44 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. Esther literally had this conversation because of us about how I was like Whitsen, my manager and I were both that are Whitsen with this guy, and it was kind of like what you're saying. I was like, I don't know what's hard about this. Yeah. I was that was what I was saying and then so yeah we did come up with a checklist for him. It wasn't a happy ending. still didn't do it and actually we switched him in the clinic. He was supposed to be my guy to check my reports. Make sure that I had the prescriptions right, that the amorizer ordered and he was missing it and I'm like you had one job anyway. And so what we did is we switched him to a customer service role. So now he answers the phone, you know makes nice nice with my cuz my patients takes the message and now it's like ah this is like and we actually put someone different in the role that we know is more meticulous and so now they like she it's a she checks all the things that the reports need to have and then it's good. We haven't had a problem in like a month so but yeah I asked her literally it was like you you can't like you didn't even try with this dude like make something happen. And yeah, so I tried, I did try, but it wasn't a happy ending that time, but I could probably do better things like a yes, no list. I just tried to give them a task list.
00:58:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So good to great. That would be a good book. So that's talked about, it uses in terms of org charts, right butts in the right seat. So let's say you're driving a bus and there's a designated seat for each function in the business, you might have all the right people on the bus, but some of them are in the wrong seats. They're in the wrong roles. Like instead of a manager, he should have been customer service. Sometimes you just got the wrong people all together and they don't belong there at all. And that generally, culture thing could be company culture, values, things like that. So you innately, or with Esther's help, I'm not sure, figured it out and well, the manager, the manager, my manager actually was.
00:59:00 - Michael’s iPhone
like, hey, how will we try this instead of just firing him? And I was like, oh, yeah, because he met all the other boxes.
00:59:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's loyal.
00:59:06 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, mean, him, I was in a month, right. Loyal, very friendly. And he met all the other boxes, he just wasn't doing this thing right.
00:59:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, a lot of things right.
00:59:20 - Michael’s iPhone
Awesome. I value loyalty lot.
00:59:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
yeah. And you should, and because you can't train loyalty. So, the other thing, and I know we're at time, but these are some of the things to look at. These are also levers, right? You can't, you can't train loyalty. You can't train integrity. You can train communication skills, but it's usually not worth it because it takes so long, because those are in-grain habits you're talking about a runway of years, which, you know, unless it's nepotism and you're trying to invest in a family member, for the most part, that's just not the best business choice to make. But you can train. skill level, you know, things like that. So if you've got somebody that's got all of the good things that you can't train, all the loyalty, all the integrity, they show up on time, they've got a great attitude and they're intelligent and they're trainable buying a place for that person, because you know what I mean? So yeah, okay, so you're gonna send me the meal macros for dinner and just add it to the reports and then we're gonna make a correlation with that and how you're sleeping. Sleeping seems to be improving. It could be Esther's letting you sleep in, it could be other things. So you're moving more, you're doing more, you just do more frequently and not only that, well, you weren't, but just knowing that you get to does something, it gives you something to look forward to. You know that there's an outlet that's coming, that does something instrumentally. Yeah. Yeah, I like to say it's borrowing energy from the future. When you worry, you borrow pain from the past. When you look forward to something you borrow energy from the future That's all I feel about it So anyway, we've got and and this is the energy You're already probably borrowing energy from the future knowing the cleaner and the babysitter and all of that stuff is coming You better send mark a picture Yes Help me pick it so he's Talking to Tina about the cars because he's like mark whatever Another car person he is though, and that's important and that matters what brings you joy brings you joy anyway okay, so Is there anything I mean again?
01:01:47 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh my last homework that I want to put down, but so I just wanted to make sure I I step my expectations, but I'm gonna talk to Esther about this is we're gonna make a list for the cleaners and my other and then the macros
01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Email to you. I do want to put in our notes that I want to finish the business spreadsheet.
01:02:05 - Michael’s iPhone
You gave me like a month to do it, but I actually want to finish it this next week. So I want to finish the business spreadsheet and that's what I'll work on this week.
01:02:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. And did you choose a time tracker?
01:02:20 - Michael’s iPhone
I haven't got that. I think I downloaded the toggle. Do you want me to work on that this week? Yeah, I do. I guess I'm fixed. I don't know. Yeah, I'm not really starting. I am starting on Wednesday like my work again. So I could do it.
01:02:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yeah, that's what I'm trying to think about. Maybe maybe we start that in September and then we can just. Okay. What I want you to think about it, but really we want. You're just in this transition period and it's kind of invalid data. The whole point of it is. real data and we don't have a flow yet and the flow is going to drastically change probably in September. I don't know, maybe not. So that's what I need you to think about is how much it'll change or not, knowing that you're in a season of change that is going to continue to change. So take that into account and then you tell me when you think it's a time to go ahead and track it knowing that it is changing. Again, we're looking for anomaly, not necessarily anomalies but patterns and corollary data so that we have a type of assessment to be able to make and just have something to pick on for optimization because there's infinite things that we could pick on to work on and they make a difference but we want to pick the most leverage thing that's going to move the needle fastest and that starts with getting some data as a baseline first. So okay so I'm going to send you this stuff in Probably about 10, 15 minutes and then we'll work on it. But if any questions, thoughts, whatever come up through the week, you can always shoot me a message.
01:04:10 - Michael’s iPhone
Sounds great. Sorry to go over, but thank you for your time.
01:04:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Totally fine. It's less about the specificity at the time and more about accomplishing what we're here for, so.
01:04:19 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah.
01:04:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
have a wonderful meeting.
01:04:22 - Michael’s iPhone
Thank you for shifting. After this, we'll go back to the 10 AM if that's okay. Oh, yeah. It's just that weird moment. Yeah, and it should already be on the calendar, right?
01:04:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, that's correct. All right. I'll see you next week.

They tag with the deer, which is hilarious. They'll chase each other up and down the fence. All right, so let's start with reports, just first your kind of verbal report of how things have gone for you this week.
00:01:00 - Michael F
I started working again so like yesterday and today I did full days of work well totally full but so I usually help with the baby until like one or something like that and then Esther takes over the rest of the evening and then I go actually we have an extra room so I go sleep in our office and then I get up whatever 745 whatever it is and then 730 and then go to work so yeah I'm thankful for the uninterrupted sleep so it's nice that Esther but yeah it's tough on Esther like she was super tired yesterday and super tired today just because I'm not helping her so it takes her like an extra you know 15 minutes to feed instead of gain sleep yeah just baby things baby things that's gonna be it so you have some assignments
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
to them?
00:02:01 - Michael F
Yeah, they lose it and then make a better, think, better chart for the sleeve, I think.
00:02:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we also talked about finishing the business spreadsheet that the time tracker, we talked about tracking time, but we're not going to start that yet, right? Because I think we said we start, I think I asked you to decide when you wanted to start because we're not really, things will normal out more once you get in September when you get your housekeeper, I guess, but she's kind of the assistant also.
00:02:46 - Michael F
Yeah, I think that's a little more reasonable.
00:02:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, going to wait until then. And how does you do on, I see the stuff that you have in the timesheet homework, but not nothing in step two, just the step one. And talk about that in a minute. talk about that in a We talked about you getting some information from the, or maybe this was the week before now, because sometimes things run together, but from the neighbors about the cleaner. Oh, yeah.
00:03:44 - Michael F
Yeah, we interviewed her. Doesn't really like the cooking, because we were thinking we could use her as a cook to meal prep for us, but the neighbor was like, she doesn't. She can cook in a pinch, but wouldn't have her as that final. She's very meticulous, like she's kind of like loves keeping things clean, so that's nice. So hopefully her and Esther will see eye to eye. And then, yeah, overall, I think the neighbor just says she's just very good with the kids. The kids love her. And, you know, she's not a teaching nanny where the kids are going to come out being like, you know, readers or stuff, she's more of just a companion. She's always talking to them in Spanish. She's just talking, talking to them. And she says both of the kids are like super, and they're both introverted. And she's like, yeah, both of my kids are just like, love talking. They talk in Spanish. And she thinks a big part of that was the, Dolores, the housekeeper, because she's just talking to them, not on her phone or anything like that. So, yeah, we feel pretty good about Something happens in employment.
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it just helps you simplify the steps to hire her formally as an employee and so we talked a little bit about the structure of how you would hire her like whether or not you would make that a separate LLC with Esther or like an escort for paying wages. Did you give that any more thought for structure?
00:05:26 - Michael F
No.
00:05:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that anything that you still want to think about?
00:05:30 - Michael F
You've got some time so. Yeah, you know I'll actually that would just the easiest things I just asked my accountant. I'm like hey can we should we can we hire this person okay and then I think that'll take some yeah I'll just shoot a quick email to my accountant that'll take care of that issue. He says yes then we'll hire her under one of the companies. He says it doesn't really matter then I'll just do this pop-ins payroll thing and and set up. I don't think I'm for that. You asked them by any chance that they use nanny cams. No, I didn't. Sorry, I was going to do that now, but didn't.
00:06:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you want a reminder to think about that or not big deal?
00:06:22 - Michael F
I think let me talk that over with Esther. think that's a good thing. Yeah, maybe a reminder to talk that with Esther. She's been, yeah, because she hasn't had my help at night. She's been a little more sleepy and jumpy. So I haven't really talked to her the last few days about anything serious, more just kind of what do you need? What food do you need by your bed? can I help you with? But I think hopefully tonight I'll be able to help out obviously tomorrow. So I think she'll feel better after she gets. I have no idea how she slept last night. She hasn't texted me all day, so she might be just dead today again.
00:07:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Maybe they all got some naps together.
00:07:10 - Michael F
Yeah, we bought a new bassinet because she was just dying. She wouldn't sleep in our other bassinet, so we're trying to win that like rocks.
00:07:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh baby swings are lifesavers.
00:07:22 - Michael F
Yeah, yeah.
00:07:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would literally just pick the baby swing up. My muscles were good. I'd just drag it around the house if I was doing kitchen work working, whatever, because yeah, it'd be when they get bigger bouncers, but yeah.
00:07:37 - Michael F
There we have one.
00:07:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but swings when they're little, especially the ones that have the mobile and the music at the same time, and they go side to side instead of front and back so that the baby doesn't experience like that falling sensation, and it's just more.
00:07:55 - Michael F
Yeah. Yeah, we have that one that goes like this.
00:07:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh huh. Yes. Okay, so what day, like is she starting the first week of September?
00:08:11 - Michael F
The contract I think we're going to do is just straight up September, I actually don't even know what day that is, Sunday, okay, so it's probably September 2nd, yeah, so we'll start her on September 2nd.
00:08:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Esther's got a few weeks, do you guys have some like days to figure it out basically where you have slow days where you can just kind of let her catch up on sleep or something?
00:08:36 - Michael F
We're gonna, oh, oh, yeah, you mean like the trial run, oh yeah, no I didn't ask Esther about that, that would be kind of neat, yeah, just like going like a sadder.
00:08:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, because Dolores works Monday through Friday with the other family, but I was asking about you like on your slow days just being able to give her a relief on a day a week or something where she could just.
00:09:00 - Michael F
catch up. Oh yeah, that's interesting. I have an like on like Monday, I could help her Sunday evening Monday. Yeah. I think about while you're back to work, there's components of it.
00:09:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One is just the actual being able to do it, but two, there is the remember how it felt as soon as you knew you had somebody coming in. There was an instant relief. So if Esther knows that there's a day that she gets to look forward to know if I could just get through this day, Michael's going to be here and I can rest and or food. She just calls me food time. so she just kind of has like, I don't have to get through to September. I just have to get through to this day. And then I can sleep all day long if that's what it takes. just kind of rest and know because I mean, it sometimes, especially when When they're that young, it can feel just so daunting that your body is never going to get a chance to recover because you don't know when you're going to get to sleep at all.
00:10:11 - Michael F
Sleep deprivation is really hard on mental health too. Yeah, I think she's catching up to her now, but yeah, that's a good idea I could offer that. She gets up every two and a half, three hours to pump, which is just killer for her sleeping. And so, yeah, on the nights that I'm around, she just focuses on pumping and then I do the bottle feed, diaper, and then rock the baby back to sleep. So yeah, I mean, I think maybe, yeah, I can ask her if there's anything more that I can do to give her a more prolonged time off, but I know the pumping is really difficult right now because she's, well, she's breastfeeding in the day, and then she says at night, breasts hurt, so she has to pump every three hours. ours to clear it. Yeah, let me ask, let me ask if there's anything I could do to just give her something to look forward to or or something.
00:11:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just until you get Dolores and in it, you know, it's not necessarily sleep doesn't have to be about nighttime, but just whenever you can get couple extra chunks like yeah, it was interesting. I was reading a study this week about how napping every well, so being a napper, being quantified as being somebody who naps at least three or more times a week, reduces death by heart disease or any kind of help heart failure by like 67% in women and like 84% in men. And that there is no medication, not necessarily being well, a pill, but any other prescription of any type that has such an impact. no pill that you can give anyone with any kind of heart issues that would have as much of an impact. so you can make all the correlation and inferences to what that does. And also, especially with people like you that have circadian issues, napping is really the only type of solution. And we know that it's been around long time because it used to be there was first sleep and second sleep, because there are people who have always been there who couldn't sleep all the way through the night. And so they got a bit little and I did things and went back to sleep. So sometimes trying to solve for nature doesn't really work out well other than doing the thing that we don't want to do in the middle of day, which is not, but it can be a minimum of it can be effective even at 20 minutes. So anything about for both of you, her and her current situation and you just overall Me being able to create nap pods where you work in your offices. Yeah, that's what my fiance does He has in his companies because he cannot sleep I call him a vampire because he's pretty much never slaves and He's got these little like egg-shaped cocoon areas that are nap pods that he can use but also his employees can use too because there are people who just can't sleep and so there's Sounds there's weighted blankets All kinds of things to kind of descend someone to just sleep much faster and come out more rested so that's kind of cool.
00:13:37 - Michael F
Yeah, I I don't think I've ever gotten into a routine of taking a nap I'm just terrible at the willpower to get up But I guess if I had to have enough if I had an appointment that was coming up, I'd have to force myself up Yeah, that's I
00:14:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
to the world. I'm comatized. So I only nap when the only way that I'm getting through the day with any kind of productivity is I have to nap. I'm physically and cognitively would I would just be a zombie who did nothing and I existed for the rest of the day. And that's unacceptable to me so I'd rather nap and even if I had to take a two hour nap and it screws up my sleep schedule and I'm up till 11 I've got things to do. So everything in life is about trade-offs. That's a trade-off I'll make. But what happens is when I'm really exhausted, it is so hard to wake up.
00:14:34 - Michael F
So there's a few things that I do.
00:14:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll have something to drink next to me, sugar. Well, like a vitamin water, not a lot. Sugar, caffeine, something like that can do it.
00:14:44 - Michael F
Just having to get up to take care of my child automatically kicks adrenaline in.
00:14:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's chemical of one sort, even if it's my own chemicals. I can't be late to pick up my daughter. And that goes back to the whole kind of thing about energy sounds. is just purposely manipulating your energy to do what you want to the other thing that I'll do is I will set my alarm and give myself like a 40 minute wake up window when I read anything I could read a book I could read Facebook especially if I read news it just pisses me off so then I get mad but then again the adrenaline kicks in and it's not about engaging with it I don't actually have to care as soon as I read I'm like let's go I got stuff to do but learning what things like if you ever happen to notice is there a thing that wakes you up like I noticed one day that I was really really exhausted and there were two types of things that immediately triggered that my blood got pumping and I was ready to go with no other kind of help other than what I was reading and stimulating it was um something that made me really happy so a message from a friend a sister my sweetheart whatever That's just me and we go, oh, that's awesome, let's go, today's great. Or that is ridiculous, this world is crazy, I get ugh, whatever, and I'm up. It sounds like a stress response, but really I kind of feed off of opposition, so it's not, it's my motivator. But if you figure out what those triggers are for you, or build in a slow wake up, so let's say you take an app and you know that you're really groggy, and there was a podcast you wanted to listen to. If you are able to, now the podcast is going to put you back asleep, you can't do that. Or read it or whatever, but something that starts stimulating your brain so that the wake up process happens, and then just allowing for the time, but when you look at 40, 50, whatever, right, versus losing even two. hours, even if it's for a 20 minute nap and let's say front loading and back loading the slow down the wake up takes you two hours. But if you get to 80 capacity for the rest of the day, that's up to me.
00:17:14 - Michael F
I like that. Yeah, I think there's natural things like right now, I'm actually sitting outside of my daughter's preschool because I'm going to get her at 315. So like on days and I think I told you in jujitsu, right, we actually three months ago, we carved out my schedule so that on Monday and Wednesdays I finished at two and then I drive to her school. I get here by three and then actually I could just sit in this lot right here and nap for 15, 20 minutes, you know, and then that could be my nap on these days, Monday, Wednesdays at least. And then for Thursday, Friday, yeah, I don't know about that wake up window. could probably think of something but even when I'm tired, there's like nothing in the world. world that is interesting to me.
00:18:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I think if I have like a deadline, like a meeting at one o'clock or, you know, 130, then that's easy.
00:18:07 - Michael F
I just say, okay, well, I could sleep until 110 and then I have a meeting at 150. So yeah, that's interesting. It was three naps a week, three or four.
00:18:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it was what qualified as a napper was at least three naps consistently.
00:18:24 - Michael F
Okay, so during, yeah, that makes sense during the work week, try to get days when you're just zocked out.
00:18:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's yeah. And you seem to always have them a couple days where sleep really, really sucked. Right? So if you use them and if you can look kind of for what the pattern is and recognize, oh, this is one of those like minimal capacity days, but maximum, like I got a lot to do. You're like, okay, throw an app in here and do a little journaling and figure out, you know, how does that equation... eight and work out how much more productive are you what does it do to the rest of your nap and what I would do is on days where you take a nap also do something make sure that there's some sunshine because it helps with melatonin production at night and then any kind of movement you can get that day so if it's and it might be harder you might be able to you might have to switch days and figure out what that rhythm is because like for me if I exercise it takes me hours to wind down and be able to go to sleep depending on when it happens and you might not be able to work out or even do jujitsu when you're really sleepy are you ever too tired for jujitsu?
00:19:47 - Michael F
no that's like if there's a day I'm not working at noon I'm just like if I'm exhausted I'll still go I'm always like that like I could work out I mean I used to always work out when I was just exhausted
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
because once I did, then I would wake me up or... Right.
00:20:04 - Michael F
But...
00:20:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yeah. Anyway, all right. So those are some things to think about.
00:20:09 - Michael F
So... like the idea of napkin. Sometime ago, I did take a sleep class in med school, and I remember there was stuff about napkin, and you know, it is beneficial to you, and I remember even a seven-minute nap was better than 60 milligrams of caffeine in cognitive tests of recall. I don't know what that study was, like, you might find that one interesting, yeah, I was like, a seven-minute nap is equivalent or better to 60 milligrams of caffeine on cognitive recall tests, like how many things you remember, but yeah, but no, yeah, I like that idea. I'm just trying to make that little change and nap something enjoyable, it's not like something that I have to force myself to do. And I think if I could just carve out a little bit of time to nap, I think that would be really cool.
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll try to shoot for too 20 minutes to start and then figure out, you know, what are the things that maybe help you get there? So for me, pressure sound because my brain is too stimulated by certain types of things. But it's not human voices and outside activity. So like, if I was in a car, I could totally sleep because people don't bother me but it's sudden loud noises that will disrupt me or it's consistent conversation because my brain wants to tune into it, even if I really don't want it to. So things to keep, maybe in the car or with you all the time, earplugs and or headphones or earbuds, know, something where you can play some and figure out what frequencies work best for you, white noise, brown noise, peak noise, prone to pink and brown, especially brown noise, a mask, which may be too much of a signal in a parking lot, if the parking lot is safe. Yeah, think about those things you do. You don't want to already know you're not being so much, but if you have a cap pulled down low, you still get the pressure on your head, it still blocks the sun out of your eyes. It has the same kind of effect, but it doesn't really send a visual signal to everybody walking by necessarily that you're napping, especially if you're like holding your phone or whatever, like you could just be listening to something. Potentially they have little weighted, instead of weighted blankets, they have weighted, it's like a lap pad. Weighted things can help people get that faster. anyway, if you're really going to be on a mission of sleep hacking and trying to get the most rejuvenation, cognitive and physical performance out of the least, then find the things that get you there faster, that get you to REM sleep or deep sleep faster and as frequently as needed in order to be able to function at the way that you want to through life.
00:22:57 - Michael F
Yeah, I like that.
00:22:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we have I have the
00:23:00 - Michael F
I have like the headphones. I have three different eye masks that I alternate with. I've never tried a weighted blanket, but I'm interested in that. I'm always hot. I always thought I'd run hot. So that's why I love the car has like cool air conditioning all the time, so I'm always cool in here.
00:23:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you always keep a sheet on you though? Like do you always want to have some sort of, okay, so that's mostly like PTSD and trauma people. So that might not be something, which is why it's really good for people, a lot of people because so many people have been through trauma. So that might not even be anything that's beneficial to you.
00:23:41 - Michael F
It might be more fun.
00:23:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I I'm in my birthday suit, like just splaining out. Free and safe, free and safe. So napping then you have to just get, so maybe taking off your shoes and being barefoot.
00:23:56 - Michael F
I hope you get a nap better.
00:23:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just like if you're in a scrubs nothing constructing so that just all of those things and if you know like today I'm going to take a nap just making sure that that's the case maybe you've got some loose scrubs for nap days I don't know just all of the things and and you'll I think you'll notice over time that you figured out because you're being intentional and strategic about it it won't always work out that you can get it but you'll be able to operate at a higher level more often than not and catch up on sleep more often than not like I have gotten to the point where I don't even have to actually sleep I just have to lay down and close my eyes 20 minutes half an hour and I'm powering through the rest of the day like I actually slept and it's shocking me but I also did discover some really good things um dl phenolanaly it's an amino acid and it's pretty much replaced capping for me it's amazing and uh I did with depression and anxiety, that's gone. And, uh, gospel title sharing helps me with my ADD. Um, during the day helps me stay focused, helps me like, I was really experienced, especially in Perry, menopause, this type of the tongue thing. could not, I've got all the words except for one. And I can't, like, I feel the word, I know what it represents, but I could not say the one word. And so I haven't been dealing with that, but being a phospholipid, it, um, coats the cells so that they can communicate better. And, uh, you know, all of these little things. And then, um, the anything that helps with the neurotransmitters, because I do have those types of issues. They all help with sleep. Uh, things to think about and find out like what your issues are as we go through this. Okay. Um, to the spreadsheet now, you're not really where we can look at it on a good screen. And it's probably been a while. So I'm just going to go ahead and recap what you wrote. Hold on, me go back to my notes real quick.
00:26:10 - Michael F
I'll be easier for you to analyze. This is our second week trying it. Is it easier in the spreadsheet format like this?
00:26:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So when this becomes really actually the most effective is when you've done time tracking and we have more details on the things and I can see basically the inventory of your hours, where your time is going, how much of your time is going, and then so if you tell me that your most profitable activities face-to-face visits now, you could quantify that because you've got meanings tracked. So we could do some math on that and we could figure out what that is. But then there would be other conversations and we are about to start getting into spending most of our time on this business stuff. It was more important to me to figure out you getting the house cleaner, the assistant, having some of that, you know, this is groundwork. But, but come September, almost all of our calls, I'm going to want you to be in front of your computer, we're going to be going over data. of the time, anytime something comes up, you know, like we just can't do that, then what we will do is redirect the conversation to catching up more in detail long sleeve, probably little bit more philosophical, just different thoughts, those types of things, like we started in the beginning. so, as a natural kind of consequence of just life, and some of those coming up, this is how we kind of circle back, have the technical, analytical, and come back to the kind of philosophical, it's not really that, it's still practical and analytical, but it's just more about how we're thinking about things. So, you, let me go ahead and let's see.
00:27:56 - Michael F
I'm excited for the business data and the numbers because As, yeah, I I think I told you that's what burned to me in my first business, know, between 20, 17, essentially. six years of my fricking life, I wasted because I never looked at numbers. And I'm really so I'm really excited to have someone to, and even now I'm not really looking at my numbers.
00:28:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm really excited to have someone to, you know, force me to look at the numbers with me. We can start. That doesn't have to wait till September. I'm glad that you're excited. So let me look at next week. Because you're just getting back to week, but that doesn't mean that still have my bookkeepers are still sending me monthly, you know, monthly balance sheets.
00:28:45 - Michael F
I have no idea how to read a balance sheet, but I'm pretty good at P&L now. But, you know, those are stuff that I can always look at. And yeah, my bank statements, of course. And yeah.
00:28:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. know what's helpful for you or what what we can do to optimize things, what you need, but um, I usually don't go deeper than P and L's and depending on how segmented some of the accountant get with that stuff, sometimes my eyes glaze over and I'm like, I want to get that deep, but yeah, I have a detail of P and L that my bookkeepers do and a condensed P and L that I've created with them in a PDF document. So we could show you both and that would be great. Um, and then just kind of going over them in detail. So the things that we're looking for first is, is anything bloated? anything bleeding? if I ask you about something and you're like, I don't really know about any of it, then I want to dig deeper into that. Are you just wasting money? Because everybody, not everybody, but so far, everybody I've worked with has had that happening at some point where it was an expense that got started and is no longer really as valuable or or efficient or something like that. we'll look at that. But then what we're looking for too is, so, because this is driving me nuts, got something in my eye and I just won't. I wanna get it out, but busy. so like looking at most profitable activities, you have Q and E face to face visits. So what do you do that generates those visits?
00:30:27 - Michael F
How do you get more of those? Yeah, that's a good question. It's a lottery system. Well, just take a step back. I have 10 offices in Northern California, and I roughly visit each of those once a month. And I step clients, I try to stack as many clients into those days, so I just have to go once. So to get a person, it's a lottery system based on how close that office is to an injured person that's claiming a work injury. So that's why I go to. like random cities that are highly populous and more blue collared so that because that's where injured people are. So in terms of like how I get more lottery hits, I have like a list of the most popular zip codes in California and I do look at that every about every year and I can kind of move locations within zip codes to find where the injured people are living in zip codes so we've tried to optimize that for the most part in our current we can only have 10 locations that's why I'm not doing like 20 but we try to optimize as best we can and that's how we've come up with our current 10 locations but I think there's more that we could do like if we kept switching them out but yeah part about switching them out is it takes about it's about it takes three months to close one location and then as soon as that's closed it takes about three to three to four months to ramp up on the next, so you're looking at like a cycle of six months to replace every one of my 10 locations. Yeah, so that's why like as long as we're maintaining at least three or four hits of the lottery every month, we're okay with that's that's what we've been doing. There's there has been locations that have gotten me less than two lottery picks a month. Those are the ones like in San Francisco, no one picked me ever in the lottery. So I cut that and I switched it to Merced, California. So that's that's the most recent switch we made.
00:32:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So one thing, do you have a report of like a spreadsheet or anything tracked where you have how many lottery hits that you get each month for each location?
00:32:48 - Michael F
I do, yes.
00:32:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Esther's manager has that.
00:32:52 - Michael F
Is that something that could be shared with me so that I could Absolutely. Yeah, I would love to see that I haven't looked at it in a box since I changed locations.
00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, what was that?
00:33:02 - Michael F
About three months ago.
00:33:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I don't even know if I have any.
00:33:07 - Michael F
Yeah. Yeah. Let me, let me collect that. That's easy to collect. I'll just ask for a minute. Okay.
00:33:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to put that on my list.
00:33:25 - Michael F
There's also little like, you know, games that are played because the more doctors that do what I do in a particular zip code, that have an office in that same zip code is me, the less lottery hits I get, right?
00:33:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's not just a population of how many people live in San Jose.
00:33:41 - Michael F
It's how many doctors just like me are in that zip code and that dilutes my lottery pick. So that's why I went to Merced to try to see if there's more fertile ground where there's less people willing to go out there. But it is two hours away.
00:33:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's two and a half hours away. So do you get a monthly report of? injuries in the location and that doctors existing in the location?
00:34:04 - Michael F
No, it's a report that I asked California for. California keeps how many lottery, lottery generated in each zip code. And then they keep track of how many doctors are in each code. So I can see how many injured workers there are, lottery hits, and I can see how many doctors per zip code. So I can request that report from the state.
00:34:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I haven't done that. I can that monthly.
00:34:30 - Michael F
I could.
00:34:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I haven't. I haven't in like six months since I chose. If when we get to an assistant or somebody figure out if there's anybody that exists that you delegate this to, but deputize somebody to do that every month and to get it to you, you shouldn't be doing it, but you should be looking at it.
00:34:50 - Michael F
So is there already somebody that exists who would have the ability to accomplish that for you and who counted on it? Our manager should, you know, she's I'm a risk master's manager should probably be the one to do this because, um, yeah, that's her. That's wonderful job just to make sure we stay in business and the job, right?
00:35:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, so let's, let's make sure that that gets done and you're looking at that every month because then you can, um, do projections more accurately and rather than be proactive, like watch, there's an adjustment, but also sometimes, um, this probably because you have so many locations, you're probably a really good sense of what's actually happening with it. The doctor population is something you wouldn't be aware of unless you're looking at it. And so let's say the doctor population is decreasing steadily and you don't know. And you're wondering, so, so there's a couple of things that I think that could happen that you may not necessarily know that that walk watching it every month could tell you. of all, if doctors are leaving, why are they leaving? Do they know something? You don't know. Has there been some legislation change that's creating issues in the business that hasn't caught up with you yet that maybe you don't want to be in that location, whatever, I don't know, the state versus local government, probably not too much of a big deal for regulations. but also, let's say, because it's a lottery, you're not getting any hints for little long, you're like, I got to pull out and go somewhere else. But simultaneously, doctors are leaving, retiring, moving, whatever. You don't know why they're moving. You just know that they're not there. Maybe instead of pulling out, you want to ride that wave out a little bit longer because the population's going. So, and you know, if you're going to be doing this for a long time, let's say, five, 10, 15, 20 years, whatever, maybe not that long. But the longer that you're going to do it, the more data you have, two things. If you're going to sell it, all the data that you have makes it more sellable, or if you ever wanted to get investors, probably not. But I'm just saying data that's There's so many different reasons why you want to have as much as possible. And as far as KPIs, that performance indicator or, I can't think of the other word that I want, it's not KPIs, whatever, but those those those indicator numbers of what could have an impact on the business, doctor population being one of them, injuries and injuries will have a correlation to industry. So let's say the industry is expanding or shrinking, if it's expanding, more injuries are going to be And that's another thing too, if you if you watch that. So we just want to have more information, track it, track it regularly, bottom line.
00:37:38 - Michael F
I like the idea, it's something that I know I should look at and I know, actually I remember why I haven't put my manager in is because in this industry, not a lot of people know you can get that data. It's called the Public Relations Act, actually you could get it, anyone can get it, you have to make a public relations data act from California and a lot of the my competitors don't know about. this. So they just kind of blindly pick locations. But I've known about this for a while. That's why I haven't given my manager this data. Only me and Esther know about it as much as we trust our manager.
00:38:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is a very small You find an NDA because even though they're really only worth as much as you're willing to go to war with, most people are more afraid of them because they don't know that.
00:38:24 - Michael F
Okay, that's a good idea. Just like be like, hey, this is part of your- yeah, give her the NDA to sign and then be like, okay, I have this confidence. So remember, Swiss, when you learn, help people make the right decisions.
00:38:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or relation is, here's your NDA. Go do this. Oh, I better not tell anybody. Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea. I don't think we've ever had our sign in NDA. mean, you should anyway because you're a doctor. I think just anything about your business. You have a specific unique business. They're as you involved. Again, they're only as good as you're willing to fight for and go to war over, but most people don't know that.
00:39:10 - Michael F
Yeah, make it easy to be tempted to share the data freely. Go on webinar and speak about, yeah, Dr.
00:39:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Food, your request to this report tells you all the data. Yep. And sometimes you can help people understand too, because sometimes people are just like, well, I'm just telling Billy Bob over here. Billy Bob doesn't know anything. Billy Bob doesn't do anything like that. You don't know who Billy Bob knows and who he talks to. He might have a friend that's in a similar business and they just have to be chatting. Oh, yeah, I heard about this thing that this guy did. And now your competitor knows it. So people are more connected than we think. They have more conversations than we think. So just say like, the safest thing is, you just don't discuss this outside of this office, period, end of story. And you could say it in the Fuji way, not the Tina with the I'll cut you eyeballs. I'm not finding a violin or anything. I'm calm. It's the sweeper in me playing soccer that is like you will not pass that has never died.
00:40:11 - Michael F
So funny.
00:40:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
okay, so sales calls to law firms for July medical. So what is an interesting one? Yeah, what generates the sales calls? What is the rhythm to that? What are like, tell me everything all around that and then I'll formulate more questions.
00:40:40 - Michael F
Well, when I started this business, um, July, this is completely so this is July medical. This is the one I worked with Mark. Mark's law firm on. I had no clients like who's going to send their client to a telehealth doctor when they can go to an in-person doctor, right? So, um, initially, I, I look back at the business that I. close with my partner and I took the whole list of everyone that had ever sent me a patient from that business and then I just literally tried to get on the phone with them and yeah I would just try to the case managers that work for those law for I found that lawyers don't do anything the lawyers don't maybe mark those but those lawyers don't it's the case managers that give me business they send their clients to me so I just got that list from my old clinic and I just called them and thankfully most of them remembered my clinic remembered my reports and I had to explain to them yeah I do the you know I do this on televisits but I'm like a quarterback and then yeah a couple of them got it so you know I got a couple referrals the first month and I just kept doing that up until about I did it for about the first six months and once I got to about six months into the business which was September of last year I kind of cut back on doing that because I just had I was I was getting good traction anyway and you know I was
00:42:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
moments are right though.
00:42:01 - Michael F
If you're not moment to mean you're dying.
00:42:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're moment to be. You're either getting or losing but you're never you never stagnant really. So be purposely intentionally. So one of the things I'd like you to consider is where in your schedule and.
00:42:25 - Michael F
Well I just not on that note. It was actually a conscious decision that Mark and I had talked about. In this in personal injury it's quite litiginous and the insurance companies will come after the doctors actually more so than the lawyers because we don't have patient client privilege and so they could take my deposition, take me to court. So at the point where my business was getting between like three to four hundred visits a month which is where I've been at for like last six months. Eight months now. That was in September, and that's when Mark and I were like, you know, if I get too big, I'm going to stick out, especially because I'm... So we actually sort of like throttled it, because if I kept getting, and what I do now is I kind of cherry pick my referrals, like I actually started turning away some, like for instance, there's a class of injury called slip and balls or dog bites, and those are highly litiginous because it's like, well, how do you know they slipped, right? There's no... It's hard to prove, and so the doctors get questioned a lot. So I actually stopped in like December, I stopped taking that with Mark's help, and now I turn away all that business, even though it could make me like a lot more money, right? But that was the way that I've, instead of like increasing the number, I've tried to pick better cases.
00:44:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so what I do you have, anything where you've done the map, a spreadsheet, a calculator of volume over quality and what that looks like to your revenue line over time?
00:44:18 - Michael F
No, it's hard because I don't get paid, I don't get paid for about maybe like 18 months to two years, like I haven't gotten paid for, like some have started paying me, but it usually takes like maybe a year, 18 months to get paid.
00:44:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm aware of that because of mark stuff.
00:44:38 - Michael F
Yeah, it's freaking wild.
00:44:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So don't you, don't you know though in roughly six months what the amount's gonna be supposed to be?
00:44:52 - Michael F
Well, I mean, I can, I have like my spreadsheet and I can tell you right now how much I expect from each case. case, like, my average. So yeah, I could apply that. Really, I'm just looking at how many cases I get in a month, right?
00:45:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I just multiply that by 300. So there's multiple things. Like, first of all, we look at the case volume, we look at attorney fees, which is, and I don't know, is there a variation of how much you get paid? There's not right? That's like always the same for every case.
00:45:27 - Michael F
I mean, if the lawyer does really well, like the average, like, I haven't done it in a while, but each law firm has a different average, right? sweet laws average is about 500 per case, but my law firms are like 300, right? but I just use 300 in my head because I'm like, well, that's the most conservative thing.
00:45:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so what I was getting at is that there are certain data points.
00:45:56 - Michael F
How many cases come in?
00:45:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many get settled? a month, how many get paid out?
00:46:03 - Michael F
That's right.
00:46:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So now he has Lidify in Salesforce. Do you have, do you just use spreadsheets?
00:46:13 - Michael F
Like where do you track your cases? When I get a check, I have a Google spreadsheet that is, I've mirrored it. So I've created a second Google spreadsheet off the first one that no one else can see except me. And then when I get a check, I just find their name and put how much money I got to get the call.
00:46:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's a better system.
00:46:36 - Michael F
Yeah, yeah. It's hard to track my month. I have no idea how much I got per month, except for my bookkeepers will tell me.
00:46:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Would it be helpful to have just one of our calls just be devoted to that business and bring Mark in for some of his ideas?
00:46:52 - Michael F
Also, no, this is not a judgey thing. This is just because he and I have worked together.
00:46:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So also, it'll help me not feel stupid because I When I get into a new business, there's so much I don't know, but I'm in here and I got to be confident and ask these questions, so this is me telling you you're not the only one, like we're all trying to figure out how to do the best thing where we're at. And we all have different skill sets that we bring to the table so, you know, my experience doing the same things over and over again in different businesses. I mean, again, I've got lots of years on you. Lots of years of practice, lots of watching my own thoughts, watching other people's faults and seeing that there are certain things to do. I'm not raising brand new babies anymore. Like, there's so many different things. But even with all of that, there's way more that I don't know that I do know, and it always will be like that. So, you know, but I was just thinking that for two things. Just his mark has been ideas, and it would help me understand your dynamic a little bit better too. to be able to see that in action on a call. I feel like I might feel like a third wheel with a romance that goes on. so we'll talk about that. would you share with me? And if you if you can, because I don't know if you can with so you do not get privileged with your with these people because that's accidents or how does that work?
00:48:36 - Michael F
Yeah, everything that I do pretty much is discoverable under with a subpoena. Yeah, it's very uncomfortable. Like they can even go as far as text message. That's why Mark and I communicate on signal because those delete and I have all my staff message on signal, all our calls are on signal. But yeah, unfortunately, everything is. I mean, like sharing, sharing data with consultants, sharing data with accountants, bookkeepers, that's not a problem.
00:49:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, because what I would like to see is basically anything that you have that you track any of your business. So what would be really helpful is, okay, this is the record, anything that you can do to give me a full understanding of why you do it, why you do it this way, what it tracks, how long you've been tracking it, that type of thing. That honestly, if that was all that we accomplished over the next couple of weeks is transferring that data so I could start kind of wrapping my head around it so that I can formulate the best questions. But here's the thing I want you to always think about when you're planning out your day, when you're planning out your week, when you're planning out your month, when you're planning out your quarter, and I don't even know if you think about it in terms of quarterly goals and things like that, that would have been my guess. Which is okay, we're just really getting track to like you're just very brand new on your own, you know, I never. used to think like that. It's really only been probably the last 10 years that I've been working that way and I could improve a lot and I do the quotes because so for example I have Mark and I think I told you to read Emith. lot of these business type books assume values that I have that I don't have and then I never will have. For example Mark's value is if I want to go in the office for month I'm not going to go into the office for a month. Now almost anybody who's a business consultant is going to say you're insane that's stupid you can't run a business like that. I would not because I would say you're not going to run the best business that way. There's going to be a lot that's going to suffer that way but there's trade-offs. If you have enough leaders in the business it's profitable. Your people are happy and your highest value is the freedom. to do what you want to with your time, I think you created the perfect thing. And business books and business courses don't approach things like that. They will give you that judge you kind of like, well, you could do better. You could hire someone, you could do this. Yeah, it's, but everything comes with more stress, every person that you hire, it's more stressed, it's more responsibility, it's more expectations. And we've already talked about how failure to mean expectations is where most stress and anxiety comes from. The more people you involve, and the more, you know, you're like, these are our goals, this is what we're doing, the more you have expectations that you have to meet. So if your higher value is flexibility, and fluidity in life, so that you can be a free agent across the board, then the trade-offs are going to be, you're going to lose some of the structure, and you're going to lose some of the benefit of the structure and momentum, but you're going to maintain that autonomy. and that freedom throughout your life. So you're leveraging everything as much as you can, not for the sake of revenue. Revenue is feeding the autonomy. Revenue is the secondary thing. The autonomy and the freedom is the first thing, which is generally who I'm working with, because yeah, I could do all of that, I don't want to. I don't either. I could have been a valedictorian and I'm like, that's way too much effort. I don't want to study. I will, whatever I accumulate during the class, that's it. I still graduated with honors, but I did zero homework. Zero studying. I'm just like, why? I'd rather play soccer. rather do this. I'd rather do that. I'd rather go, yeah. cheerleader and football and track and softball and tennis. Is that everything?
00:52:52 - Michael F
Basketball.
00:52:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like to play. I still like to play a lot. So. You're you're in the season of parenthood. So we'll take all those things are in the count, but when What time is it?
00:53:08 - Michael F
When do we start?
00:53:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, 15 When you're looking at these things I Always want you to start now. You're probably not gonna be looking at this in the week But but I would like you to just glance at this at least once a week for little while while you're starting to consider Time-blocking Which is not necessarily something you're going to do On a physical level like putting into the calendar you can and we can talk about that I Do mental time blocks because that's how loose I keep my calendar There are some things that are physically on there. They're the appointments. They're the meanings Everything else is I am keeping kind of a mental note of the types of things that I want to do and I always know what my priority is I always know I'm always thinking about it. So I always know and also because I've been doing it so long and it's so steady. I don't have to do that. But I still do on occasion come back and look at things like this myself. So you've got in these two businesses. Now QME is the one that makes all the money right now, right?
00:54:17 - Michael F
Yeah. And that's the freedom thing and it's why I July because as long as I'm doing QMEs, I have to do face to face like today, right? There's no getting around that. Like I know that at least 10 days a month, have to 10 days a month or maybe eight, depending on if it's full or not. But like at least eight days a month, I have to be somewhere and that, yeah, I think it's good for the amount of money it makes.
00:54:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, I mean, a long term, I would like to off for a month.
00:54:52 - Michael F
And not have to worry about that. So that's why that's a big reason why I like July and why I'm just kind of foster it.
00:55:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, for those purposes, the thing that you want to be thinking about with the QME is how do we maximize lottery hits, which is retracting the data and seeing what it is. And we can use some AI to look at the reports, too, instead of having just brain fatigue going over and trying to look at patterns we might be missing. And we can do that. And I'll show you how, even if you already use it, almost every time I show somebody something, I process it differently. And so there's a new thought, oh, I didn't think to do it this way. So we'll do that. And so every week, you at least ponder multiple times throughout the week, is there anything I can do to increase these visits? If you just think of it like, no, not really, but you still want it to be kind of at the back of your mind constantly, so that you're intuitive. except there's a kind of just on that, you know what I mean? You might hear a conversation about something that just was like, maybe I should be looking in this area, whatever. So just the kind of thinking about it just increases your perception or opportunities that might be out, or threats. And for a July medical, we want to figure out what levers there are. So, you want to make sure you don't have opposing goals. Sorry. This smoke is super bad here today.
00:56:34 - Michael F
The air quality is like 281.
00:56:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The fires are so bad.
00:56:38 - Michael F
Where are you again?
00:56:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Southern Oregon. Commathals. I don't know if you're part of it. It's a hit though. But yeah, but we get everybody's smoke. It just lands on our basin. What was I thinking? Okay, so you have to watch for opposing goals. If the goal is July medical is your path to freedom, but you're trying to stay under the radar, so you're not growing. Do those conflict?
00:57:11 - Michael F
Yes. Yes.
00:57:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do. And if autonomy is the ultimate goal, then are you going to live your life based off of fear of competition? I would say that's a terrible way to live. You have to decide what's the most important thing. Now, I'm not saying don't mitigate those risks in whatever ways that you can. What I'm saying is that we figure out are there other ways to do that. So those are longer conversations.
00:57:52 - Michael F
They're not necessarily longer conversations. They're ongoing conversations.
00:57:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
These are the kind of things where answers reveal themselves because we're intentionally looking for them. solutions. But you have to decide and you already have, but you need to make sure also that you're on the same page with whoever you're talking to, including Mark. But if your priority is July medical is your path to being as free as you want with your time, then that has to be the price. Originally, priority didn't even have it was it was singular.
00:58:24 - Michael F
There was no plural form of the word. Yeah, that's true. I can imagine. It was just there was there was one.
00:58:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's the one thing. I see now we have multiple and and they're right. But there has to be one greatest above all priority. Okay. And that should be autonomy because that insinuates and implies that you've got the financial resources that like I talk about these three different currencies, time, energy, and money that that that autonomy or freedom means that you've got all of what you want and need sufficiently. at least, right? And you want for nothing. And everything else feeds that goal. So you maximize how they feed that goal. There is, by nature of life, an enemy in opposition to all things. So if you're constantly focusing on the enemy in the opposition, what you're not focusing on is the growth.
00:59:29 - Michael F
Oh, yeah, that's absolutely right in July right now.
00:59:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but what we think about comes about where we put our energy and mind to, that's what increases. If you're focused on the scarcity and the threat, that's which you're increasing and manifesting. And if you're focusing on the growth, if there's sufficient growth, it mitigates competition anyway. If you're networking so well and taking care of of the people that send you business, the attorneys, if they're just falling in love with you like Mark's tweeted, what do you care if there's competition? They're going to cut you out? No. Also, I fully believe you can't take what's mine and you can't take what's Fuji's. It's either for you or it's not. So even if that's wrong, we know that there is evidence from MRIs, from all kinds of things that show what our brains do when we believe things, when we focus on things. It activates us. We behave differently. So you just have to make a choice of am I going to focus on playing small, on purpose, on purpose is what you just told me or being free.
01:00:58 - Michael F
Yeah, that's a it's a good point. I mean, yeah, I've been just staying kind of small since September of last year. Really, I haven't pushed growth at all. I'm just, yeah, it's been nice. It's, I don't know, nice, but it's kind of bruising and we're growing in the right way, I think, but I'm not really pushing it at all.
01:01:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, it's kind of weird, huh? It is weird.
01:01:20 - Michael F
Well, and there is definitely something to be said about keeping the guardrails on so that you don't grow too big, that it becomes a problem.
01:01:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But then if you're looking at scaling, then, then a part of that is hiring the right kind of person, hiring somebody who can help it grow so that it doesn't become a burden, like Mark has Mary, but also he's got some really great attorneys and he's investing and coaching in them to make them better leaders. And we've done things like more surveys to find out what their weaknesses are. what are the things that they feel like they need to know. So we've got um grief counseling for the intake people so that they could learn how to have those conversations with people who have lost loved ones because they died. It's some of the the intake people they're like that is really heavy. I don't know how to deal with that because they feel that other person's energy and it was hard on them. And that had never been addressed before until we asked the surveys and in a particular way like his net promoter score surveys were useless to me. I'm like you're not asking anything that is very corporate-esque and it says I'm asking you because I feel like I have to ask you I don't really care. So we changed the questions and then the other thing that we found out is that people feel like they're not good at sales calls which we already knew but the fact that they're aware of it and they want to be better is wonderful. So we went and got black something. I can't remember what it is. Anyway, and they came in and they taught sales. And her best attorney, just from reading their book, like, she already figured out a strategy that was making her money immediately. Sam, yep. so, and it wasn't that everybody was better across the board from all of these things. It was that there were pockets of improvement, but they wouldn't have existed without finding out what they needed. That wouldn't have existed if Mark did invest in coaching for himself and caring about leadership. So his goal still is, I don't really want to go into the office. And so, my job is to figure out how do we make the best out of all of these things as much as they can be without you going in and being a leader and overseer. He's still leading, but he's leading from a recliner because that's what he wants. nothing wrong with that. I mean, he's still like, he's hard working, he's doing lots of things, he's just not in the office with his people. And statistically, that's not what you think of as somebody leading, you know, there. But he's happy with it. It's also not the most profitable thing, but Mark has been growing happier and happier and happier since I've known him. I used to call him Eor. That's funny. Because I'd say how you think he's I'd say, okay, bye, have a great day. He's like, yeah. Okay, yours and Tiggers, you know, he has a Tigger.
01:04:51 - Michael F
That's so funny.
01:04:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, and now he just, he almost never has that energy. And when he does, he automatically is like, yeah. But this is what's good, and this is what's good, and this is what's good, and I'm like that's my boy right there So It's all it's all the process anyway. Oh crap the time. Geez Okay So I want you to start thinking more about how do you get more of your most profitable activity or More out of your most profitable activity. So you're not necessarily trying to spend more time doing it But trying to milk what you can out of it sometimes it's more time and then How we can support that the other work activities? This is where time tracking comes in we want to figure out what we can delegate and so if you look at it and go These are things also. What is not getting done? That should be done. Go ahead and put that down there and we'll highlight that in a different way Things that you know should be happening in your business, but isn't we want that list And then step two, oh, you did, no, I knew you didn't. Okay, yeah, step two. I really want you to fill out step two because what that is is things that energize you, things that drain you. it ranks how good you are at stuff. So that helps with delegation, but it also helps us figure out where's the sharpening of the saw activities that we need to do. And even if we're only putting a little bit of saw sharpening activities monthly, right? The pace is gonna be dictated by you and what you wanna do. But categorizing the things that you do across profitability and then energy and then skill really helps us rank where the time goes so that we can get the most out of it and also how we can utilize other people to get the most out of your existing team and assets and kind of future pace and figure out What would come next in order to get you to more of the profitable either activities or higher leverage profitable activities? Yep, I like that plan Okay All right, so I will send you some notes and In a few minutes because otherwise I might forget and I don't want to do that And then I will talk to you Monday cool.
01:07:25 - Michael F
I have my alarm set this time, and I will not miss it I have two three four alarms back up And always tuned it if you want to because my Mondays are crazy long but that you said that that was consistently the best for you Monday is the most consistent day that I have all four.
01:07:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:07:44 - Michael F
Yeah, so Good luck.
01:07:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I only work one Monday a month generally So I didn't Quality to protein and take the day before And just let me know did you did anything pop out to you.
01:08:03 - Michael F
Okay. Okay. was good.
01:08:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Any questions or anything?
01:08:08 - Michael F
No, thank you so much for scheduling.
01:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

I will text her real quick and see. Oh, well I said it was little don't I see it.
00:00:34 - mark sweet
For easy like how important it is to go and meet the doctors face to face. It does take a lot of time, but especially in other states.
00:00:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:00:46 - mark sweet
Yeah, it makes a big difference because there's more and more of these California firms just like going through or doing what they're doing and just trying to separate ourselves little bit and put a case to a name and whatever. I think it spends some time with them because the people generally like me a lot once they meet me.
00:01:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've noticed.
00:01:09 - mark sweet
Yay.
00:01:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's our trauma. I admit.
00:01:20 - Chona Sweet
What? Hi.
00:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi.
00:01:23 - Chona Sweet
I was in Google. don't know what happened.
00:01:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's um Um, sometimes the the events just have it there by default. Um, if I and if I'm not careful and don't delete it.
00:01:39 - Chona Sweet
So oh, uh, yeah.
00:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've had zoom issues all day. I literally just got it installed and marking it like 601 and had to uninstall it after fighting with it. So I'm audio only today. um, yeah. Okay. Let me go to my notes real quick. Oh, it was good. I've been exhausted all week after just getting back late and then taking my daughter to seminary. then this morning, she wakes me up at 4.53 a.m.
00:02:18 - Chona Sweet (3)
she's like, mom, I'm late for seminary. And I get up and I'm like, my heart's racing and everything because I'm like, oh, I slept through my alarm. And then I look at the clock and I'm like, you don't go for an hour.
00:02:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
there was no catching up on sleep.
00:02:33 - Chona Sweet (3)
I tried to with their like little tiny windows here and there.
00:02:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm just like, yes, that's been fun. But she's doing good. So anyway, how's your charting been going?
00:02:46 - Chona Sweet (3)
It's, you know, it's still a challenge, but I feel like I'm getting better. I feel like it's really yeah. It's still a challenge.
00:02:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's a work in progress. Whoa.
00:03:00 - Chona Sweet (3)
show me explain to me what's getting better um i don't wait maybe more than two days to chart so i guess that's a like an improvement i thought you told me you were gonna do your charting at the same day yeah it was getting difficult um how many people are you seeing each day so like um yesterday it's just telemedicine but two days before it's um i have almost almost 35 and 90 i would say 80 percent of that is like new patients because of the new contract we have like influx of new patients and yeah did you just tell me you saw a 95 patients on one day no no no no I said 90, 80%, 30 plus patients, actually I feel like it's more than that I have to count because it's like 18 in the morning and I think I have almost 20 in afternoon and like 80 plus or 90% of that are new patients. So when it's like new patients I was just a lot more charting because they're new.
00:04:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what's the average length of time to chart for a new patient?
00:04:40 - Chona Sweet (3)
I honestly do not.
00:04:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like I don't really time it but that's the first thing that we need to do. And so here's what I'm to tell you, Chana. I said it in the beginning but now you're getting to the point where like we can really kind of feel it. This is tedious.
00:05:00 - Chona Sweet (3)
in the beginning, right?
00:05:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is tedious in the beginning. But if you will do the things that I ask you to do, we will get through the tedious faster than any other way. So timing yourself and observing the things I'm going to ask you to observe is adding tedious on top of tedious. But the fastest way for me to help you systemize and simplify what you're doing and to speed it up. Is to be able to understand what the baseline is first. Yeah, and I can send you notes at the end of this too.
00:05:40 - Chona Sweet (3)
Let me go make sure my note taker is working because I feel like it's definitely more work for new patients. I definitely find myself. So, you know, getting, you know, I'm trying not to, because I'm trying to, I know it's going to be all hard work. It's just that I feel, I know early on that when I get busy with the PI stuff, I know which one to cut. And I don't, and I know, when I say I have to cut means, I know what to tell Dr. E, which one I don't like.
00:06:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you mean, like between what you're doing in PI stuff?
00:06:42 - Chona Sweet (3)
No, because the PI stuff, because it's like, remember the one, two, three, I'm on number one, which is the main word. And out of the number one, there's three categories, I guess, if it says that, first it's the hottest. Hospital rounding and I haven't even get to that because I have yet to get the privilege from the hospitals So there's one the second one is the clinic work, which I Don't know I guess from the beginning. I already know that I don't like clinic Mm-hmm, but the clinic setting are like the bread and butter of a Pain clinic basically, so that's where the bulk of our patient population is and that's where the Remember if you if you remember the the contract that I was saying that he the doctor He recently acquired that's where the majority of patient will be and then the third category is the telemedicine Which is you know, just how it tells tell them medicine phone call, but it's best basically medication refill or ordering other treatments for the patients. And yeah, so the number one cat, a number two category of seeing patients in the clinic is my least favorite because I feel like it's just more work in terms of charting. Seeing patients in the clinic, it's not my favorite thing ever since I become a nurse, I don't like clinic work, maybe because of the charting and I mentioned before to you, I really don't like writing a lot, but the hospital setting is very much focused charting. I think that makes sense, oh, the patient have pain here, it should be the same, but for some reason that clinic charting has more charting and it's just annoying. However, I know that the PI or the pain or the personal injury cases are considered clinic patients, but obviously I feel that I'm putting a lot more effort on the PI clinic patients if that makes sense. Yeah. And I'm trying not to in a way because I don't want to be that person that I have to take care of the patient more because I'm getting paid more on it, you know, but I talked to Mark about this the other day and I don't know, it doesn't sit well with me, but I know it's the reality of the situation and not just me. I'm sure everyone that gets paid more on PI patients, you know, day. It kind of like I have to give a little bit more I Just work on it.
00:10:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just find myself catering to them more and Kind of don't like it in a way, but at the same time I do I the reason why I said I don't like it I want to treat everyone the same I guess that's why I'm trying to say okay so Let me ask a few questions and figuring this out will It'll take a while it'll it'll take multiple conversations, which is gonna take multiple weeks But what do you like about your job?
00:10:43 - Chona Sweet (3)
I like when Ever since I become nurse it's been typically A management, which was 11 years ago. I like that I Work as an NP, which is a different level of autonomy As compared to being an RN, a bedside nurse, I like that I can give what I think would help with the patient. I can order it right away and I can see the results right away, of like ABC type. I like that. And then lastly, I like it when a patient with, you know, the instantaneous gratification of saying thank you because it helps them. Eventually, the most difficult one is in the pain population, they're one of the most difficult ones because there's a lot of, I feel like, negotiation skills that I'm doing, you know, like, I can't give you more narcotics, but trying to convince them that narcotics is not the only treatment, there are other treatments. It's difficult, but it's fulfilling once they've Realize it themselves.
00:12:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so like what, what kind of treatment do you suggest? I'm like sure you have all kinds of different types of pain and levels and options. But what are some of the non narcotic options that you suggest?
00:12:21 - Chona Sweet (3)
So like, um, I guess I'll talk to it based on my experience. I can do things like my experience in the hospital, which is the bulk of my experience. Because I work in a hospital, you know, as a pain and P is in the instantaneous result of I can order IV tylenol and some people don't even know that exists or IV magnesium or IV vitamin C for pain. And some people would not even think that even helpful. Yeah. Um, or even can. I mean, ketamine is anesthetic, it's not narcotic. So that's why I like hospital setting a lot. It's very instantaneous that there's more access. I just realized that just now, maybe that's the reason why I like hospital setting more. But now doing the clinic setting, while I'm awaiting to work in a hospital, like doing the clinic setting, I feel like I'm limited in a way and it's geared towards more intervention type procedure, which I was not, that's a new thing for me. Anything like if the patient has back pain and they will look at the MRI and see, oh, you have stenosis, you have narrowing on the disc and that's why the PT medication doesn't work for you. So we may recommend you to have an epidural which is done by the anesthesiologist. So notice that that thought process is very much common in the clinic setting, and that also correlates with PI patients.
00:14:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and so do you imagine that there's a path where you can understand the nuance of the clinical setting and so I understand that the limitations that you have access to options in the hospital that you don't have access to in the pain clinic and when you know that something could be really helpful and it doesn't require an invasive procedure and it doesn't require a narcotic which comes with all kinds of other side effects and issues, dependencies and whatnot, that that can be frustrating. But do you feel like you can and work with the options that are there and just and feel any kind of like personal satisfaction, knowing that you're giving the options that maybe aren't the same as the hospital, but that you're giving the best that's available to them in the place that they went to.
00:15:17 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah, yeah, I do. And I know that it's temporary until I have the privilege in the hospital. And I think it's designed that way to not make us feel that, you know, like just set stationary, like, oh, we're just doing clinics every day of the week, day to day. So how it's, so I in my head, it's temporary, so I understand. And I know that I need to understand the clinic culture and setting anyways, because that's how I can succeed with my PI cases, which is this, Number two, out of the three source of income. But also, there's one thing that is new, that I haven't fully utilized by myself because I'm not an experienced on it, is I can do injections on my own too. That is intervention, but that is something that I can do, and it's exciting to explore because I've done it multiple times without the E, but I haven't done it by myself. So I almost did it by myself the other day, but Dr. E is available, so I'd rather him do it with me. Yeah, well, that's in and of itself, it's a procedure, but it's not as, I guess, it's excessive like an epidural interest, yeah.
00:16:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so what we'll do every week is try to figure out what are the, Because even in the beginning while you're still wrapping your head around everything and waiting for access and whatnot, there should be something that we can do. And even if it's just a perspective shift, like earlier in the week, we talked about writing your own story, know, that what you feel like your limitations are culturally, language, that's not permanent, you know. You, there are different things that you can do, and we talked about just the practice using, using translate tools, using chat dbt, whatever to help you overcome the language barrier. And then over time, because there's, there's only so many things you're going to have to write over time. Obviously, there's a wide variety, right? But eventually the repetition is going to kick in and you're going to know the same phrasing and you're going to know it in proper grammar and you're not going to feel embarrassed anymore, and you're not going to feel like you're less than for any reason. We know that the only way that's going to happen is over time. So we can't shortcut that per se, but we can kind of expedite it with the tools that you use. And then the other thing we can do is just you just remind yourself that your story today isn't your story next year. So and kind of looking forward to that. And a year is one of my favorite perspective tools. So it's really difficult to to map out significant change when you're evolving as a person, even more so than professionally. Sometimes professionally you can do it, but the the wow effect really doesn't happen in a month. It doesn't happen generally in a quarter in the six months, but the wow effect is almost always happening. Like I've never not had that happen with anybody I'm working with in the course of a year. You look back over a year, like, that was significant, even when it's just kind of. still subtle, you can clearly see some measuring points where this was, you know, significantly different or that was significantly different and then you can kind of add in the compounding. So one of the things I just want you to do every day is remind yourself that, first of all, define and I think I asked you in text but I'm going to ask you now as kind of write down what you want this to look like a year from now. How do you want to feel about charting? How do you want to feel about the way that you write? You know, I don't love writing. I hate it. I'm 48 years old. I'm never going to love writing it and now typing but if I could just automatically download everything I wanted to say, then I'd be happy but that's not going to happen. So anyway, you know, it doesn't mean that you're going to love it or feel like you're great at it but what we do want to do. Um, is at least not feel so much resentment or frustration about it and, um, if it's one of those things we just have to bear down, then you bear down, but there are dictation softwares.
00:20:14 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:20:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. so are you using anything to help you with that?
00:20:18 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah. So, um, Dr. E actually just called me today and say that, um, he bought a, the, the dragon for healthcare. They, that's what they like.
00:20:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:20:30 - Chona Sweet (3)
but I can't use it on the apples. So, but he, he said he got me a lots of which I'll, I'll get it tomorrow. So, I'm excited for that. I'm sure I still have to be vigilant on editing it because of my accent until it, until it adopts, I guess, to my accent, but, um, I, I, you know, I, I think what I feel to do today. I feel okay. I, I don't feel like. It just waxes and wanes how I feel on, you know, feeling quote, unquote, less than, but I'm happy with what I've been doing. I mean, it's not perfect. It's a work in progress, but I, I feel like each part of the three, the streams of income, I'm working towards like the, like, I told you the Washington, I submitted that already. So I contacted my university to submit my transcripts to Washington State, and I'm happy about that.
00:21:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
okay, that's an accomplishment. Yeah. Um, so I just did a quick Google search on how do I do new patient charting faster and I put pain clinics.
00:21:44 - Chona Sweet (3)
So the first thing I came up with is use dictation software like dragon.
00:21:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The other one it said was electronic health record can help you chart faster by automating tasks and allowing you to chart from anywhere.
00:21:58 - Chona Sweet (3)
And yeah, we can. Yeah, which is what I do that I feel like being having the capacity to chart at home It's a blessing and occurs in in a way to me because I feel like I Have this sense of okay. I finished seeing the patient boom boom boom. Maybe do a quick You know jot down a few notes on each basin and just tend the note and then chart at home So that means I'm finishing my work at home versus finishing it at work Which I think I should not dab it as a good as bad. It's just how it's just what I I'd rather be at home And chart at home be comfortable, but that means I'm bringing work home at home And sometimes I push the limit on maybe I can do it a little bit later and then yeah I'm up till 2 a.m. It's a slippery slope.
00:22:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so this is where you really want to define your values When when I talked about like writing your story what so this is this is not not. This is going to be an iterative process as well. So what I would like you to do is kind of map out your ideal week. Now, it's not going to be the same all the time. Some weeks you're going to have special events, trips, things that you want to do. Some days you might have an extra load of patience. days, know, we're women, there's an entire week that sometimes just feels terrible once a month. It's all kinds of things that can affect you and reduce your productivity, reduce your mental capacity. So you have to take that into account when we when we map out the ideal week. There are people that will call it like a perfect day exercise. There's no such thing, but the ideal week and you want to look at like what is your work day look like? When do you start? How are you starting your morning? do you want to feel in the morning? do you want to think in the morning? What do you not want to feel? And then a negative match list is really, really important because a lot of times it's easier to write the positive things by putting in the negative attributes. for me in the morning, I don't want to feel stress at all. It's bad for me physically. cortisol is dangerous. It's really difficult to capture goodness in the rest of the day and to be productive. But also the morning time and in the evening is when I'm with my girls the most. And so I don't want to spoil or even infect them with negative energy and stress. So I don't check email. I don't look at anything that could cause me stress. And also I'm most creative in the morning and late at night. So it's kind of the wee little quiet hours around the house. don't know if it has to do with timing or just has to do with around. But for me, those are the creative times. So in those times, I want to make sure that my schedule is not, I don't want to be having conversations. So I don't schedule calls until after 10 or 11 during the day because I want to do my creative organizational administrative tasks in the morning and in the evening as well. So I don't have calls during that time. So those are some of the things that I've figured out for myself in terms of types of tasks. other thing I've realized is that I have my best phone call time between 11 and 2, 10 and 1. Kind of depends on the day. But I want to help people. I have more energy during that time. My brain is functioning well at the time. And because of what my clients pay me, I want to give them my best brain for problem solving and also my best energy for other people's problems. So now you've got a different kind of schedule. don't have as much flow in that, but what you do have is what kind of home life do you want? What do you do anything in the evening that you want to protect? Is there a dinner time? Is there a snuggle time? Is there a you want to go for a walk? Is there a hanging out with friends? I'm like, whatever those things are, and maybe it's not the same every day, but whatever those are, you want to kind of plan how you do your charting and whether or not you take it home that night based off of the things that you want to do. And you also need to be aware of your discipline and your tendency to let the work creep into the most important things. So, and I'll tell you another kind of filtering process that I use to make some decisions, because generally the choice. that we make aren't between whether it's a good thing or a bad thing, which is easy, right? Because if I know it's bad, I'm not going to do it. But it's degrees. So a lot of times it's between good or better or best. But because you've only got 24 hours in the day, and you're only conscious for approximately, you know, 14 of them will say, allowing for the waking up and then going to sleep and actually being asleep. But and then there's only so much that you're not commuting and you're you only have control over what you're doing. If you say, if you give your yeses to the good things, to just good things, then you don't have yeses to give to the better things. And you don't have yes to give to the best things, because you're already committed by doing good. Well, it's not bad that you're doing good, but it's not the best. And you know, we get one life, we get one day at a time to do things. So thinking about, do you want to have your best day or You want to have a good day, obviously. Nothing wrong with a good day, right? But good days are just that and they're not necessarily inspiring or as fulfilling. So just kind of thinking about if you finish your charting at work, do you have your best chance at having the best night or a good night, you know what I mean?
00:28:27 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah, I mean our market's traveling right now, but we really are kind of like, I forgot the term used, but we like to walk at night or late at night even, like 9, 8, but I find myself charting, like if it's not here, if it's here I find myself charting. So I feel I'm not a morning person. So I like to do things in the afternoon or night time, so like the clinic work, it really starts at 9.45. So before I go to a clinic and if I have telemedicine, let's say I have 12 or 10 patients I need to call, I try to call that first while I'm at the house before I get to the clinic. And then Dr. E is like, oh it's a quick two, three minutes, four minutes phone call, but for me being new, I found myself talking to them for a longer time, that I don't think it's necessary, but I could have probably make it more necessary.
00:29:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know what you might do, I don't know if you'd be willing to do this, but call control skills are a big thing. I've talked to Mark about it because his people could use it. Most people don't have have great call control skills. Some people do, but it is a skill to kind of finesse a conversation and keep it on track, especially when you want everybody to feel good and you want to make sure that they're happy and they feel taken care of.
00:30:20 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah, they don't feel right.
00:30:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, but you can to accomplish isn't whether or not they feel rushed. It's whether or not they felt heard, seen, understood, and taken care of. The timing is not relevant to them. So if you can deliver an effective conversation where they feel heard, seen, understood, and taken care of, they don't care if it took three minutes. They just care that it was effective.
00:30:50 - Chona Sweet (3)
Does that make sense?
00:30:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, right. That's true. If you have the ability to record some of your phone calls and have Dr.

listen to them and say, Okay, what could I have? down to tighten this up then maybe he can give you a couple of scripting type ideas like say if this comes up this is what you should say if this comes up this is what you should say or he might say things like chon never ask this question because it's always going to lead to way too much like and if you deal with this type of person like i'm sure since he gave you that kind of time frame he's probably got some finesse type skills that he's picked up that he could give to you but he might not even know where to start unless he hears you and goes oh yeah here's where you're messing up and you could tighten this up does that make sense right it does um although i probably feel like in a way dr e is the quintessential doctors that are i don't know how to say it but i'm pretty sure i understand what you're saying so it's like uh you're doing good no changes oh how's your kid okay great so Let me first let me refill your medications. We'll talk to you next time. Okay, that's it. So And I feel like in a way, I feel I need to ask more. I am sure because I'm still, you know new to the group and I don't usually call patients on the phone and end up just prescribing them narcotics, whether they're on it for a long time or not. Like today, for example, I was talking to a cancer patient. Cancer patients were more lenient with narcotics, right? want them to be comfortable, right? I'm talking during the phone and she sounds very, very sleepy. And I can hear there's family in the background coaching her what to say. I said, I can hear your family in the background, I can talk to them if you're okay. with that. And so I ended up talking to the husband and the daughter. And I was very, very clear to have to be clear that, you know, if you think he's being very sleepy, do not give the needed narcotics is the last thing you want is for her to stop reading. And, you know, things like that, I feel like there's just no way around it. I just need to make sure that they understand what I'm trying to say. yeah. And then the other day, there's a patient like, I'm done talking to with her. And then she's like, oh, okay. And I'm kind of like saying goodbye. And she said, you're the first person I talked to today. I feel bad, you know.
00:33:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if I told her, I told her, maybe you need to go out and talk more to your neighbors.
00:33:50 - Chona Sweet (3)
I don't Yeah, those are the examples.
00:33:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, I I understand that there's a reason I'm a business for myself, and I make my own roles, because I want to do what I want to do and how I want to do it. And you have to operate according to the dictates of your own conscience, but you also have to realize where you're at and what's compatible. So one of the things is that I didn't get to a place where I could be how I wanted to be just because I wanted to be there. I had to create and I paid a price. I walked away from all income while I had four daughters to raise by myself four different times. It was terrifying. At one point I was on food stands because I just wouldn't take crap from clients that it was making me unhappy. So when I say I'll pay a price, I'll pay a price that most people would never pay in order to get what I want. But that's not, you know, but there are some things that I did tolerate because I just needed to and because of the bigger mission. required it and it made me a better person because it is important I think to learn how to work within certain parameters and not just give up or want to grenade everything. I'm really good at grenading things and just be like, you know, blow it up. So there are areas I think where you you might be like I'm I have an opportunity to serve and I feel like I need to and there might be other times where you feel that you have an opportunity to serve and comfort but this probably isn't isn't the time and isn't necessary and some of the parameters might be and it's going to be hard asking yourself so the conversation with the lady who's lonely that's a that's a whole therapy session right there it is and I feel
00:36:00 - Chona Sweet (3)
Bad and to even say goodbye to her, but I redirected it in a way that gave suggestion, maybe a need to, you know, talk to your neighbors or call your family too. He's elderly. And again, I.
00:36:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm going to pause you just for a second because it you're not going to have the answers right away, but one of the things is you can kind of develop your own toolkit sort of thing. Right. So some of these scenarios that you run into and you know, this is going to take time. If I were to handle it the way that I wanted to handle it. But if I spend that time, then I'm going to lose my time with market nights because I have to spend more time charting because I spent too much time on phone calls. Or I'm going to be impatient with somebody else who also needs me because I spent too much time doing this and that's not fair to the next person. So there's all kinds of different reasons why it's important to. within boundaries because what they want and need most is is the medical attention that you've been assigned to give them. But what you can do is come up with some kind of scripted responses for certain types of things. So if you get somebody who's just lonely and you're working in a particular area, there might be resources that you could send to them and maybe you could say, hey, maybe you could get their email. Maybe you can just send them a letter and it's scripted and you have it pre-written. Like here are some things like I really want to spend more time talking to you, but and obviously there are probably things you just shouldn't say. Maybe you shouldn't have said that, right? You have to be careful what you say to anybody. Maybe you can say, hey, I didn't know. Maybe you didn't know about these resources and maybe it's a senior center and maybe it's a visiting program where people visit the elderly or or some sort of something where you've got a list. of resources for different types of needs that people might have. Maybe you have a cancer patient-specific type of list of resources like, hey, these are the things that you need to know and understand. For example, if they're too sleepy, here's the risks of taking narcotics. So is it more important to you that they feel absolutely no pain or is it more important to you that they live? You know, because sometimes those are the choices. again, just because I'm saying this doesn't mean that's the right thing to do. In the medical world, you have to be very careful with what you do. So I would run anything that you want to do and say by Dr. E, maybe by Mark, and just make sure that what you're doing is okay. But what I would say is try to find a way to satisfy that nurturing need that you have inside of you that loves and cares for people and why you went into that.
00:39:00 - Chona Sweet (3)
probably. I think, yeah.
00:39:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but also keep it keep it in perspective that if you give everything to one person, then it takes away from the other people that you're giving to you. And so kind of balancing it out and also that you can't fix everybody's everything. Right. You're not their therapist, you're not their daughter, best friend, sister, whatever. But you can be the person that takes great care of their pain and use them the resources and make sure that they know that there are other options, actually cares. Even if they don't feel that you care, Jonah, you know if you care. So that has to be something that brings you comfort too. Because if you took this outside of the pain management, how many times have you said something to someone with good intention and care and concern and they acted like you said something bad? or tried to hurt them or didn't care about them and totally took what you said the wrong way. It happens a lot, right? Yeah. Okay, so, right, so but you wanna make this personal and bigger when it happens at work because it's work and it's important and they have needs but it doesn't change the fact that people will take things the wrong way. People will get offended. People will project their other issues onto you. You have to be able to deflect that. There's no way that you're gonna be successful in this long term and be happy if you don't learn how to compartmentalize and deflect that projection and those issues that they're just not yours and it's not heartless. I'm like, I'm a bear at heart, so.
00:40:54 - Chona Sweet (3)
Right. And I think it's just a matter of, I think I've been with him. for a month, but it it's only been the last week that I'm really on my own. Yeah. he, I don't know, I think he's just wanted to make sure that I'm supported and I said that I'm fine, but I do have, I still have, I still find it challenging or difficult to complete the charting each day. That's still, that's still an ongoing issue, but it's not a new issue for me, per se, like I tend to procrastinate, especially if it's something that I'm not, like, if I just, if I know I would, I'd like to do something, I can finish it in like a few minutes, if I really, really want to. So yeah, I'm gonna ask you a word question.
00:42:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you cold? I Get cold easy Okay, cuz you're hugging a pillow and I want to know if it's because they're colder because they're stressed out and it's a defense Oh, I know the pillow is my comfort. Yeah, it's comfort.
00:42:18 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah Here like if I don't feel I guess It's like comforting because of other issues like You know with my you know other Insecurities with my body when I know that that's what I thought that that was and I just wanted to check if it was You just happen to be cold and it was warm or because Yeah, but when you got it And the way that you hugged it it kind of was an indicator that that that you that's that's this is trustful little comfort it definitely might comfort and I Get Well, I feel like the body image issues one thing, but this work, I don't like it when there's no, I don't have the flow because I just don't have it yet, it's beyond my control. So until I have that flow, until I know exactly what I'm doing in a week or two weeks, I would feel a little uneasy about it. But I'm trying to control what I can't control, that's where I'm at. Learning things about the PI and just, I feel like I'm trying to do things like simultaneously.
00:43:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're doing a lot right now, it's a lot to learn and it's not just a lot to learn. I would imagine there's some things that go through your head like, I don't really have to do this because you don't have to do it. It's one thing when you have to make money and take care of your family. It's just not, you know what I mean? But you have bigger aspirations and you have goals about how you want to see yourself.
00:44:12 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah, I definitely, you know, that's what I did the Washington right away and, you know, Mark is helping me kind of start the conversation about having clients from different chiropractors.
00:44:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:44:28 - Chona Sweet (3)
I know it may not happen until early next year, but at least I get my licensure and then hopefully we can start. I guess Mark is saying that I need to have a different LLC for Washington. Oh, yeah. I don't know. But, you know, that's like one thing and I definitely need organization with my receive. I don't know. What I'm doing now is taking a picture and putting it under my favorite. But with the upgrade updates of the iPhone, like I cannot see the favorites right away So I Just need to be more organized with that. don't have a lot of You know expenses right now, but the other thing that comes up is you know, I I need There's a lot of good things happening in my life my career like I really need to take care of my my body myself So I start working out and the instructor that I mean them The instructor that's helping me she have a scheduling system that texts people and I know markets kind of working on that as well But a keyword is mark is working on it and not mean I feel like like you're waiting I feel like I cannot it appreciates me that I have to wait for him before I can move forward I trust what he says, but it doesn't mean it doesn't frustrate me. Also, I understand that I'm not ready to eat my own in that honor itself also frustrates me. I feel like, you know, in my head, I cannot be super ready for this. I know I just have to like learn as I go, and I'm trying my best to understand as much as I can. And I also understand that with me doing this affects marks reputation. So that worries me, makes me anxious, but that's a conversation I have within myself that, you know, I know I'm new, but I have, I'm not new to what I'm doing medically. So that's just, it's like just all those things that I... My question is to Mark about this and you know, I'm sure it's just that growing process of this having a new thing.
00:47:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's the biggest thing is the newness of adult, everything's new. relationships are new, the processes are new, the pressure is new, time management is new, the knowledge of some of the things including business and different responsibilities. That's all new. Like you're having to wrap your head around and your body and your energy and your schedule and your routine and your mindset around all of these things all at once. And that's a lot, but you can do it. And one of the things I would love for you to do is just every day tell me something that went good, tell me something that you're proud of. So like you've got the Washington stuff done, that's great. Every day, just every work day, just send me something that you're like, I'm proud of myself for this. If you're struggling to find something like that and you tell me tonight, I don't have anything I'm proud of today, I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions until we find out what your product is, because there's no way you didn't do something that each day.
00:48:17 - Chona Sweet (3)
Oh yeah, I know. I feel like I'm already proud of, I know I've been there for, I think, on my third week, I was able to get the electronic prescription that my colleagues that's been there for a while apparently took them two to three months to get while I get it in three weeks. I was proud of that. Good job. I was at the other doctor that came at the same time with me, that started at the same time with And he texted me, and he said, how are you able to get get the, the, he he he he said, He skipped fast, so I tried to help him. But anyways, I was proud of that. But I don't know if I'm too, I'm proud of how I get it, but how did you do it? So I can call them multiple times, and it's frustrating. And there's a multi-step process that they have to verify cross match with your credit score and all of that. And for some reason, they cannot verify me. So I created an email. I created a ticket. And on that ticket, I wrote a long email, basically saying that I do not understand why their company or their system cannot verify me while the other government institutions like the DEA. Okay, for the California Board of Nursing, things like that, I mentioned names, these bigger government institutions can verify me, and your system cannot.
00:50:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how hard is that?
00:50:16 - Chona Sweet (3)
Well, I was, everybody, that's my favorite thing, is just be like, listen, so yeah, I kind of basically also said that, look, the way that your system is holding me back on taking care of my patients, so yeah, I was, I was initially part of it, but then I didn't know that Dr. E's manager can also see the text, and we talked to each other and she's like, man, I saw your text, I'm like, ooh, Jordan can be spicy, and it's like, I was annoyed.
00:50:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look, first of all, you're going to be able to take care of patients better, and maybe somebody got a little fire lit under them, they probably didn't, but You know, their apathy is a plague in almost every type of business and definitely inside of government institutions and good for you standing up, but good for you articulating. And here's the thing, because you keep talking about like what you can't do with your English and grammar and whatever, but your ability to articulate the, that's a good lawyer tactic by the way. Also, that argument was indefensible because you're like, wait a minute, like all these other people can verify me. The same information is available to you, yet you can't seem to be able to do it. I'm not going to tell you your inept, but basically I showed you your inept and also it's costing my patience.
00:51:47 - Chona Sweet (3)
Girl, I was shocked when someone responded to me via email on a Saturday. I was like, I keep on responding to them back and forth, I like caring. I try it again. I keep on trying and then I kind of said it like not ultimately but kind of I said this is the third and last time I'm going to try this. If this doesn't work your system needs to override me. That's what I said and they did. So I was actually shocked it worked but yeah.
00:52:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not that's my go-to move if I have problems with people. I don't have problems with Mark because Mark is always nice and good and everything but like if I like teachers, principals, whatever somebody not handling business very well, accompanying.
00:52:37 - Chona Sweet (3)
You know what this reminds me actually and I was telling Mark this that I really wanted to become a lawyer when I was in college but anyway that's a different story.
00:52:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh it's your but it fits perfectly with what you're doing because patients need an advocate and an advocate is another word for what attorneys do right. They advocate for their clients. Well, you need to advocate for your patients and that's all that you were doing as you were advocating for all of them by being able to have this process and do that so good.
00:53:10 - Chona Sweet (3)
So that what I was doing is Dr. E would let me see all his patients either with him or by myself just until I get used to it and then he has to order the medication for me and then the patient starts to get upset at me coming back or calling to the office saying you didn't set my medication but it's not my fault it's Dr. E's fault because he doesn't do it on time. So I have to do work around on that one where I said you're here, log in and I'm gonna order this and let you look at it before I send it so that's what we've been doing and I don't like that. I want to do it my own on my own my own time.
00:53:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah. Okay, so here's what we're gonna do I need you to time five new patient charts. and five follow-up patient charts okay okay just do it as accurately as you can it just will give us a baseline to kind of figure out what it's doing and and we'll see what we get from there okay you're using drag and dictation that has to train that takes a little while there could be some shortcuts some abbreviations things like that it'll take a little while to figure out how to optimize your charting system as much as can be done and then the other thing the other assignment is I really want you to map out and and write out what does your ideal week look like are there particular times of the day or times of the day on specific days of the week where you're not charting you're not staying up late you're doing something else going for walks with Mar watching TV, resting, whatever, like whatever the things are working out.
00:55:05 - Chona Sweet (3)
You want me to think of like in the future or my ideal in the period.
00:55:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how about now like what is compatible with your life as it is right now and what you would like it to be a year from now?
00:55:22 - Chona Sweet (3)
Okay because I feel like with the Washington it's gonna be busy. That's why I mentioned once that starts and you know took off then I will have to pick and choose what I do with Dr. Lee.
00:55:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's part of the benefit of this exercise is that we compare it with what you actually have to do and what's actually in your life and go do these things match up so either you're giving up some of what you ideally want in order to do these other things and maybe it's temporarily or you optimize your day and your time a little bit better because you want to do the work and also you want to have these other particular times. So the biggest part is just consciously evaluating what has to be done, what is wanted to be done, and how the two are compatible and where the compromises have to happen if you're going to do it all and what compromises maybe you're just like I'm not I'm didn't sign up for this this is not what I want to do but where you probably will be like instead of that and that extreme like okay I want to do all of this so how do I get more done in less time how do I and then it probably will because you're taking a lot on figure out which things are best for you whether because it's more satisfying to you it earns more money, maybe it's something that you and Marc get to do more together of in the PI stuff, even though you don't like that, like there's all these different things that have to be evaluated and they all have different pros and cons.
00:57:15 - Chona Sweet (3)
Right. I think eventually when that time comes, and I call it as a retirement career, because I feel like I will always want to do something using money, is that I can travel, and Marc can never talk about this, I know that eventually our goal is to be able to travel and still make money. Yeah. Well, like if I do the telemedicine, even if I call a certain amount of patients finding that sweet number is the goal later on, that will still make me money.
00:57:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. And when there's also point where you make enough that your money can be the way that you make your money through investments and other types of things. So if you have any type of interest in that, that's, that's, and just how long do you work? Do you want to work five years, 10 years, 15 years? How much do you want to work? How much do you want to earn? How much do you want to have in your investments making money for you? not just because it's money, but because you, you had, you wanted to feel like you did something productive and meaningful. And the one thing about earning your own money is that you feel like you can put it towards the things that you want to. Like, it's a different level of satisfaction. It's not about the money per se. It's about what it unlocks for you to be able to do. It's just a resource. you have your own time. Sometimes you have your own energy, right? have, but, but money is just another currency exchange that, that we use.
00:58:53 - Chona Sweet (3)
So it's not, but anyway, not the end of, you know, it's, it's, Yeah, it's not my, I want that so I can buy or do something that I want. make the travel and make money, think that's like the best thing I have.
00:59:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, my work is portable.
00:59:14 - Chona Sweet (3)
I can take it anywhere that I want to.
00:59:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I think about money for me and like energy. I don't, I don't want a lot of things that other people do, but beauty is important to me. scenery is important to me, experiences are important to me and they energize me. And with that energy, it increases my creativity, but also I take that energy back to my people. So, you know, being poor is not compatible with serving people the way that I want to serve them because I want to be thinking low level thoughts instead of high level thoughts. You know, there's a lot to take into account anyway, but so every day. Just tell me something that you're really proud of and that that and just celebrate the wins. You can tell me the things that you're frustrating. with you but we have to end it on this is what I did good or learned this is how I grew this is like some kind of something like that every day because it will just help keep things in perspective I need you to and I will write this out map time five new patient charts and five follow-up charts yeah every day just using dragon and getting a practice at it and just kind of seeing and observing do you feel like it's getting better just kind of just kind of watching the process and seeing what you can do and that's a start like that's a lot to do for this week and then the ideal week like what does the ideal week look like now and then a year from now knowing that it's going to change knowing that we're never going to have that picture exactly but that we have the greatest chance of creating something that you're really happy with by being intense. Intentional in terms of how you create it Yeah Thank you You're welcome. Do you have any questions or anything? No, I um, I just yeah I I need to that's a very you know like actionable I said like I need to tie myself Yeah, and don't don't stress and obsess but you do wanna always push yourself like you committed to giving your best and I'll so I'll tell you one last thing real quick before we go and this is kind of my own Tool that I use and I call it an energy sandwich So if I have to do things I don't like Anything I don't like drains my energy and it makes me in a bad mood. don't like doing there's a lot of things to do But so the first thing I will do is I'll start that activity before I start that activity I'll do something that I like um It could just be snuggling with the dog. It could be talking to somebody I like. could be I had a good lunch. It could be a nap. It could be all kinds of different things. It could be good music. It could be sunshine breaks. I like to go outside and just let the sun absorb into my skin. I get the energy from it. It feels good. And then the other thing is afterwards I plan something that will boost my energy as well. doesn't have to be long. Sometimes it's just putting on headphones and listening to something that without fail I cannot be still. It makes me dance. It makes me just feel good. So I use music really strongly like that especially if I don't have a lot of time. And the other thing is if I do something that's super stressful then I need to go do a physical activity because the tension is in my muscles. So like a little walk that might be when I go to the gym depending on how much time I have. I might do some housework. Sometimes I will just pace back and forth. but it still gets all the energy out. So just kind of noticing how your activities are impacting your energy and trying to sandwich good things in between bad things, even if it's just for five minutes here and there so that you're not staying in negative energy for any excess of amount of time. Okay, I know I've talked your air off already.
01:03:25 - Chona Sweet (3)
I'll let you go. Thank you so much. don't know where Mark is but he's probably asleep now.
01:03:32 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)

01:03:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

Hey, yeah, I can hear you.
00:00:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How was vacation?
00:00:05 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
It was good. Just got home really late last night. But other than that, it was fun.
00:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I had a good time. Yeah. Was it like a family thing or you just like hanging out?
00:00:18 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Nice. Nice.
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel? Well, you probably feel too tired to be refreshed, but. Yeah. Do you feel refreshed at all?
00:00:30 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah. Because my friends like, we like to really chill out. So we weren't doing too many activities.
00:00:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice.
00:00:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
We had a lot of time to relax and stuff. So I didn't think I needed a vacation. But after I came back, was like, yeah, needed that.
00:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's funny sometimes how you don't know what you need until you get it.
00:00:53 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
And then you're like, oh, It's like sometimes getting a massage and like the masseuse gets in there. like, I did not know that. I heard that bad and then exactly you did that and I was like, oh, I think I needed that.
00:01:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good though. I'm glad that you got it and I'm glad you got that perspective and hopefully you'll remember both that it was useful but also that you weren't aware of how much you needed it. So in the future just kind of think about your time and your energy and maybe there are other things that are day to day like you can't have a vacation all the time but like maybe there are other kinds of things that you could do with your time and your energy that would be helpful that you didn't really know would be like that impactful.
00:01:42 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
You know what I mean?
00:01:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So you've been gone a while so I have no idea if you've thought about any of the conversations we've been talking about like it's been a while a couple weeks since we've chatted. Any, any thoughts where you were gone or just preparing for the call today?
00:02:10 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Um, probably, but I don't really remember the last meeting.
00:02:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:02:18 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
know most of it was with Lorenz and, you know, how he structures his team and everything like that. But I mean, some good news is, you know, I was gone for a week and I would still check my computer and stuff, but I'm proud of the team because it's all the work that they were doing and, you know, how they were handling everything and, you know, obviously I wasn't there working full time, but it looks like they were able to hold things down, which makes me comfortable knowing that they were working and able to kind of handle the caselope without me being there. Um, so that was good to see that's that's awesome.
00:03:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Actually, so let me go because I was looking at the numbers for one. Um, which one is. Okay, July so for. So what I was finding interesting. And this month is definitely going to be skewed a little bit because you're out. Hold on a second. I'm still reviewing it. Um, so first of all, let's just kind of recap. Well, I'm taking it. I lost my notes. I don't have too many windows, but I need a few of them to be able to do this. So some of the things that we had talked about was just. Um, the leadership that you were already working on and employing in your team, things like noticing that. at Patsy needed a little bit more clarity and direction and like do this and you don't need to be asked to do it just you know here's your job here's what we expect and and get that done which probably went into you know how things went when you were gone and then I never really I don't know but I haven't memorized who you have I feel like it's Elsie I'm Cynthia Elsie and Cynthia yeah wait did I say Patsy what did I say yeah Patsy sorry I meant Cynthia oh my gosh I don't know what there's some names it just makes up in my head but I did know the difference sorry um although I don't have bases for either one of them so that that kind of happens but Patsy's are in Take Lady and Cynthia is yours and she's been bounced around a few people I remember um anyway so just kind of thinking about That those leadership roles, thinking about the kind of person that you are for your team, that you can be a safe space, which means that you actually have the ability to ask of your team things that other people couldn't. And I don't mean, you know, exceeding boundaries or anything, but meaning that they wouldn't get the same kind of results that you would because you're a safe person, because you'll ask and rather than make somebody feel afraid to mess up or do something wrong or get in trouble, they'll be like, oh, yeah, I totally could do that. And they feel empowered to be able to try to do their best job, because when people are afraid of making mistakes, they don't actually do their best at all. They just do just enough to get bias so that they don't cause problems, which is actually counterproductive, because they end up not, you know, giving their all, but it makes them feel a little bit safer to stay safe. smaller if that makes sense.
00:06:02 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Right.
00:06:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But because you have an energy that is not that is like you are intentionally looking out for how they feel and not wanting to overwhelm or intimidate or scare them off or make them feel bad, you can ask for say, you know, let's just just for example what you did with Cynthia say these are the things that I need you to do and then have compliance and have a work on it. So one of the things to try to look for is what are the other things that might be able to improve a little bit in terms of have follow up maybe with cases and making making calls in a timely manner, making sure that the cases that have the greatest potential for higher attorney fees are handled, or if one is at risk for whatever reason of sub-out or drop-out, well, not sub-out, but yeah, sub-out, not drop-out. That's being prioritized so that we don't lose the case, things like that. So that's one thing. I'm thinking I forgot what I was going to ask you. I should have wrote that down. Oh, oh proud. Okay, so we're looking at stats. me just provide some real quick. And I'm going to share my screen and don't think I'm sharing anything I'm not supposed to, and then I'll just get yelled at if I am just kidding because Mark doesn't yell, but not me anyway. Does Mark yell?
00:07:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Never.
00:07:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That sounds not right. I mean, I can see him having it, especially the conversations we had in the beginning. I think he told me about having a temper and I think I yelled at him a few times and said stop it. So, but I don't know how he is now. Anyway, okay, so I'm looking at cases this year and obviously I know that the thing to keep in mind is that you, your cases are throttled. You get a lot of Mark's cases. they're not just your own and everything hasn't been opened up to you like it has to the other attorneys. So, this is not apples to apples by any means. But I still think that it's impressive in the resolutions. So, in June, Tyler had 19, Samantha had 21, and you had 21. And to me, and I could be wrong about this, but that's kind of a good indicator. So, there was this, but it's not enough data, right? So, Look how small this one. There's only three for the month so far compared to 13 and seven and I almost don't even want to compare Tyler. I'd rather compare just Samantha. And then Lauren's isn't even on the board for this month. So You know what resolutions mean, like, is that Is it isn't that when you are paid out? Which one is the one that's your paid out? Which one is the one that it's done done?
00:09:30 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Done done is money and attorney's fees.
00:09:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but there's And then there's cases settled. Yes, and that's which one I'm trying to figure out cases closed or resolution.
00:09:44 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
That's one of these two. Okay, because whichever Okay, yeah, cases closed would mean money and And then resolution is like any sort of settlement.
00:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, so that that's what I was looking at. And that's the thing, this is what you guys have the most control over, not when you get paid, right?
00:10:05 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
How much do I have for resolutions?
00:10:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For this month?
00:10:10 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
00:10:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Three.
00:10:12 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah, that's not accurate.
00:10:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and that's the other thing, this is a new report. So I don't know if you remember, I was looking at it and saying I didn't know if I want to show it yet.
00:10:21 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah, my list is 10, so.
00:10:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and what about last month?
00:10:27 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
So I can compare. Last month was 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 2, 14, 15, 16, 18. 18? And those were all my cases, were any mark crossovers.
00:10:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and then let's compare cases closed, so paid, is I want to see what these numbers are and then all.
00:10:55 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
So last month I had 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
00:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, Okay. And the month before. One, two, three, four, five, six, eight. Okay. Oh, what did I click on? I'm gonna do that. Okay, so then I need to send a note off just a second. Mark.
00:12:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
You Okay.
00:12:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, I sent that off. Hopefully we can get that figured out. Oh, let's see. Policy limit. Okay, I'm not going to look at this anymore right now, whoops, because I want to make sure that it's accurate. So we'll dig into that. That report's only actually few days old, a few days, a few weeks old, and it usually takes us a few iterations, actually, let me go, let's see, reports, oh, that's why report reports. Let's see matters closed, we'll just type in matters, matters by team, or by principal attorney active matters, and I want that, I want that much by team. Let's see if I can edit this. No filter. I. Attorney. No, not as fun to be. Owner. So would the attorney be the owner?
00:14:29 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Probably. Yeah, that would be accurate. Sometimes it'll change and the owner will be the old attorney, but I don't have too many of those.
00:14:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so we'll just say. See if that will. Well. Save and run. And then. right. right. right. All right.
00:15:21 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
That means we take our fee and hold like a certain amount in a trust account until I'll hold in trust.
00:15:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, let's see but there's 141. So does that sound right? 141 records that you think that you've gone through? Let's see if I can create a status. I do want already. All right. So part of this process, though, is learning how to get better reports so that we can have, first of all, accurate data and then, well, accurate data that matters and really review it so that you can know exactly where you stand and also how you're ranking within the team. So since I don't have something reliable, how about you tell me what your team did while you were gone is as much detail as possible because that will also help me with the reporting stuff and then also help us with next questions and what we're going to work on.
00:16:46 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
You said how they did when were gone. would have to be choked.
00:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, let's just do this. Let's kind of take inventory of last week. So we'll look at how many new cases were there. How many got settled. Just any, any issues, any calls, if there was any disbursements that happened. Yeah.
00:17:23 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Okay, let me see. We got one, two, four, five new cases last week. We did two settlements last week. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. And then for fees, we got two as well.
00:18:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what percentage of. So you're going, your max is 40% right for attorney fees. Yeah. What, what, what were each of those two cases?
00:18:25 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
40%.
00:18:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
00:18:29 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah. One of them was a big, big case or fee was 68,000.
00:18:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And who handled that conversation?
00:18:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
I did that one. Oh, you did that.
00:18:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, good job. Okay. So you handled the conversation about distributions, not disbursements.
00:18:54 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah. Actually, for all my cases, I do once it gets to like closing it out, getting the district. patient sign, I do all that.
00:19:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, for all the cases, so what I'm trying to dig into is when you came back and you said your team did really well, how do you measure that? How do you quantify that? Like, what did you look at and go? That's they did that well.
00:19:25 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
I noticed I got multiple emails on certain cases where we were waiting one medical bill in order for me to send a demand and they would let me know that it came in and that it's ready to be demanded. The new cases that come in, I know that's all mostly LC, reaching out to the clients, setting them up with treatment. That was getting done. I can see that certain things that were coming in, Cynthia was saving them in the case files, know, notating how much the chiropractor. it was, we use this internal thing on Lidify, it's called Chatter. That's where they kind of let me know, you know, this on updates on cases. We had one case, it was like a weird sub out, it's one of Mark's cases, I guess the guy had another firm for like a while, and then he signed on with us. But I wasn't there to, you know, handle that, and Cynthia was able to send all the documents, the case file, so that got handled. And I would see the notifications on slide, like a call would come in, and you know, I'll see what, you know, take it. So I keep eye on those things, which lets me know that, you know, if they're not really on top of things that they'll either be slow to respond, or they won't take the call. Um, so that lets me know that, you know, they were on top of everything. Um, was sending me requests for authorized treatment for certain clients, um, is important because we need to make sure that, you know, the policy limits are adequate enough to authorize certain treatment, for example, Um, so she was asking me, you know, she was sending me emails and saying, can you please, you know, authorize X for this client?
00:21:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, and you, you know, you were on vacation. You responded to all of that?
00:21:39 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah. Yeah. had my computer out there. So, um, when I had time, I would go through and see what, you know, what was urgent and respond to those.
00:21:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think your average response time was during that time.
00:21:51 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
I was pretty slow because we're three hours behind over there. So. I was working like. I was. eight PM our time.
00:22:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you were so they never waited longer than a day. Yeah, that's awesome. I mean, you're you're so that kind of speaks to the leadership skills too. And now I know that it comes with the territory that stuff still has to get handled and has to be done timely.
00:22:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
But that doesn't mean everybody does their job. You know that, right? Yeah, I know.
00:22:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So one of the things that that probably had a huge impact on the fact that your team was staying on top of it was that you were also staying on top of it, even when on vacation. So that's really important. And you gave them a very clear signal that work matters and that we will we will get things done. And so even while not being physically present, although are you guys all remote? Who's in the office?
00:22:50 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Um, they're both in the office every now and then I'll see what we'll come home. Um, that's for the most part. She's she's in the office.
00:22:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So that's great. Now, if you were to go and look for things that maybe weren't handled well, first of all, did it occur to you to do that? Did you think about doing that? Did you do that? Look to see if anything slipped while you were on it.
00:23:20 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah, because what happens is on like, at some point we'll get like our clients policy limits or the other, you know, full parties policy limits. And I noticed like on two cases, like, because we get a lot of documents from this and team, it's like a lot. And I already told the team, like, I have like a CD, so I'll double check to make sure certain things get notated. And naturally like things, even when I'm there, like, I'll see we'll get to it, but for me, like knowing the policy limits is like one of the key parts of the case, because it's so easy to like authorize an injection. or we don't know what the limits are and it can get really bad, so I just like to know and it's just like a piece of mine for everybody, even Mark, when he's looking through the case to know, it's like our baseline for how the case is going to go. So I just noticed like we would get a declaration page which shows policy limits and then just wasn't notated in the file. So there were a few cases where I went and I did that myself, which I do when I'm in the office anyways. But other than that, nothing where I was like, hey, like keep an eye on this, can't make this mistake again type of thing. I just honestly felt like I was just another week.
00:24:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so that kind of stuff happens anyway, right?
00:24:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Is that what you're saying? it gets done, but like I'm just like when I see those like two letters PL, which means policy limits like I'm just like really quick on it just because I don't want to miss it.
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you've communicated that I'm sure you have to them that that that's the thing that like that has to be on every single case.
00:25:07 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
00:25:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how is that received? you feel like? I mean, this is the job and nobody's perfect all the time. Right. There's got to be a margin of error. But what we can do, what we can work on is focus on the big rocks. So what. What are the things that matter the most knowing what the policy limits are definitely right up there.
00:25:36 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Right.
00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if something else slips, that's maybe less important. And I don't even know what that would be. But, but let's say that there are non-negotiable like these always need to get done. matter what. Don't everyone see this. There's not a threat implied that there are anything. It's just that this is non-negotiable. Make sure this happens on every case. Do not finish or no. until you've checked yourself, are the policy limits notated, that type of thing. Have you had a conversation to that degree? Now, I can sound very kind of like hostile forcehole. So I'm not talking about with my energy, right? I'm talking about with that kind of clarity and emphasis on this has to be done every time.
00:26:26 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah, that's one of them. Because even they know like, if we don't know what type of insurance we're dealing with because Elsie sets up the treatment. So once she goes to do that, she'll naturally have a tendency to look and see how much room we have money-wise, you know, for treatment. Now there are times where we know the other party's insurance or our insurance has like a lot of money, then it's not as important to figure out everybody's coverage because if it's like half a million, like, there's... definitely plenty of money, so we don't need to know exactly how much everybody has right now, because the case probably won't go that far. But on cases where she's going to set up treatment a week or two has gone by and we don't have any insurance yet, then it's like they know to make sure we figure out or else if you're authorizing treatment without any insurance because there may not even be any insurance. That's when that gets like expedited, so they'll figure out how much money we have to work with. That's one. Another one is client calls when we get a new case, not to let it like more than one day go by without any client contact. I'm trying to think of other non-negotiables. like if a client's like kind of threatening to sub out like any type of like text or anything like that to call them right away or well sometimes I'll call right away just to kind of calm the client down because if you know say we get that text and no one reached out then it's you know pretty bad mistake so that's another one. Certain things like if we have a $15,000 limit never authorized more than one MRI because we don't have the money to. The teams are pretty good at that. I would say those are like the main like none of those triple things it's just like basic case management setups.
00:28:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I know that you're not in the place where you get incentive yet. And I know that the team doesn't have an incentive plan, but right now Samantha has her own, Lorenz has his own. I did talk to Mark about trying to standardize that. That's kind of a long process. It's an ongoing conversation about modifying that anyway. But in the meantime, these are the types of things that would be generating incentive pay for you, which would then give you something to reward them with. So do you have any sets, kind of review periods with your team or just like one-on-one conversations and meetings about performance and any issues they might have and what kind of support they need as a structured set type of conversation?
00:29:58 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
We have our weekly meetings. But other than that, like anything one on one haven't really done yet. Cynthia will come in like every now and then and just, you know, to me, make sure that she's doing a good job. And then with Elsie, I haven't had a one on one with her yet. I think she's only been with us almost not even six months yet. But like on the big cases where I know like it was a pain to settle that one or get it done or like a really big one, I make sure like on our settlement channel, you know, to put their names in there too, just to make sure that they feel like they're a part of it because it's so easy for the attorney to take credit on the cases where in reality, like the team is the one who's doing a majority of the grant work that helped. I'll just get the case done. I know Cynthia appreciates that a lot. I'll see's a little bit more.
00:31:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The appreciates just being given credit for that work? Yeah.
00:31:11 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Lawrence told me that when she did come to my team. So that's been good. So I keep those things in mind. if I know there was one case, almost half a million settlement, Cynthia helped get these records that the insurance really wanted to see before they would throw out an offer and she got that done really quickly. So when we settled the case, I made sure to put her name in there too, and how she helped contribute to the case. That's like not money stuff incentive, but yeah, I know that if I was on her end, you know, I would appreciate my work being noted, you know, that way, when they come to work, it's not like, well, I'm doing all this work and the attorneys. Taking all the credit for it. They get more pay to me Because at the end of the day like I feel like everybody thinks about those type of things I want my team to know like Just because I have a degree doesn't mean like I'm on a different pedestal Now sometimes I'll request records if I really need it Just to show them that like we're all on the same They level like no one's better than anybody And I feel like those type of things when I'm gone. It's like they do their best job when I'm not there out of respect Because of the way that you know I treat them overall Ask you a question though Do Cynthia doesn't do I have any kind of college degree? I don't know to be honest or elsey I'm not sure either one does the one thing to keep in mind is
00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
on a human being level and on a showing up to work level, know, that part is equal, but the investment that you made to get to your job is not.
00:33:12 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Right.
00:33:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
of school, so that kind of time, and then also the money that goes into school, whether you paid it out of pocket or however it got funded, that's a lot of money. Yeah. that, you'll never get that time back. You invested that to be here, whereas somebody else just applied for our job. So even if they got experience on the job somewhere else, they were still getting paid for that.
00:33:41 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
You don't get paid to go to school.
00:33:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. that is one thing to keep in mind when it comes to it is that you're not all equal in the workforce when it comes to that because you've paid a price that they didn't pay. So, your return is, the other thing is they are not accountable when things go wrong, you have the liability they don't. And part of the compensation is your risk and your liability for the work that's getting done. And that's a real thing. Now the odds that something is going to go so bad that you're going to, that it's going to ever actually cost you is probably pretty low because you're managing things well. But there is real risk involved in practicing law. And they don't have that risk, they don't bear that risk. And they didn't make the investment of all that time and all that money. So it is important and I want you just to kind of stash that away in case it ever comes up. And at least just ponder it like what does that mean and how would that show up when you do get incentive and I think that that is something that you should take into account. This isn't about being better than anyone else or how you show up right now. So for example, you know, when I do my work, I've had people try to figure out how long something takes me and want to pay me an hourly rates. And I work faster than five, sometimes 10 people, depending on who it is. I, but the reason I can do that is because I've acquired a lot of skill in my practice. I've put in hours and hours and hours of work and study and repetitions to make me really good at it. I have top-of-the-line equipment all the time, all the time. I say on top of it all the time. So when somebody's paying me and I don't even do hourly work anymore, but when somebody's paying me, they're getting access to all of that. All of those scales, all that experience, the money that I spent on the technology. And so they're trying to compare me, sometimes they would, this is historical, try to compare me to somebody else or what they think is industry standard. I'm like, son, I'm not industry standard. Look at the results, that's obvious. But it's the same kind of math, right? People want to do and think that they're doing the equation and that this is what it's like in a job. We're all a team and we're all equal, but not all teams are equal. So let's say you've got the captain of the varsity team and he steps down to play with the second string and they're not all equal. The skill level is not equal, the hours probably are not equal. So it's just important. I just want you to make sure that you keep that in mind. there's a way to use that information. and not understanding without, you know, it's not a power trip or lording over. I just want to make sure that you don't undermine yourself or discount what you have brought to the table and also the burden that you bear that is invisible because liability nobody's thinking about it. You might think about it from time to time. They're probably not thinking like if this goes wrong, you know, I might lose job at Patrick could be sued. You know what I mean?
00:37:33 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
00:37:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, I know it was a long whole monologue thing. I just want to talk about these things as we're kind of going into how you're structuring and leaning. Okay, so client calls now. Okay, so I think that it would be a good idea for you to set up and they can be very short, but monthly one-on-ones with individual member. So with right, your current team is just LC and Cynthia. So with each of them, and it should have a specific agenda of things that need to be covered for sure, all the non-negotiables should be covered, things that you've noticed. Hey, Cynthia, great job. a single one of your people went more than a day without being contacted when you were here, right? Any kind of threats to sub out, you handled it immediately. You never authorized more than one MRI when somebody had a $15,000 any of those things. So first of all, they know how much you're paying attention to what they're doing, and they're getting credit for not just, hey, good job, but very specific, good job, right? Did you play sports?
00:38:52 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
don't remember if you told me that or not. Yeah, I played a waterfall and I swam in high school.

That's right. I remember I remembered it was water. I forgot about the polo, but yeah, so anyway, just really specifics about about what they're doing and what they're doing really well and maybe especially because if let's say they're not doing one thing really well, when you bring that out, no, it does not feel good. likes that and but but it still has to be said. You can soften the blow instead of just by saying, hey, you need to fix this because this isn't happening and this is this is crucial. Soften the blow, but you have been amazing at this and you've been amazing at this and you've been amazing at that and so keep doing this job also and not but right because everybody ignores everything after the blood but also let's work on improving this and then when the incentive time comes around, you have specific things that you can. pay your incentive on. So it can be these types of things. There'll probably be some other things you want to break down. Basically, anything that is a lever or a switch, you know, in the business that makes a significant impact that you can track, that you can measure for sure, all of those things that you just mentioned. There may be a little bit more detail and nuance to it. Maybe it's the reporting. Maybe it's the communication. I don't know, but these are the things that we want to look at. And so then if you have a meeting with them each month and you're letting them know, hey, I've looked at all of this stuff and really you're like, I'm so impressed. You did this. You did this. You did this. You did this. You did this. that is amazing. I did notice this. I would love to work on this. Is there any way I can support you in doing better here? And then you be quiet and see what they feel like. And generally, especially if you really have people that want to do well and care about how you feel about it. You'll either maybe get the actually I know that I kind of been dropping the ball and I could do better and just okay will you do better and then again you be quiet. Not just hey I know you can do better but very specifically an accountability question will you do better and if they say they're gonna say yes nobody's gonna say no and sometimes they may say try I'll try and then you can rephrase it and say I didn't ask you if you try I asked you well you do better and if they say well you know I'll try it okay so if you can't commit to doing better is there a reason why you can't commit to doing better is it is that is that hard for you do you need some training in that area is it you know what I mean like Is that an opportunity to either maybe shift that task to somebody else or strengthen them, give them training? But if you see something wrong and they can't say, I 100% can do better and I'm going to do better, then you want to figure out and drill down a little bit more. OK, why not? And how can we make that better? But I think that with the goals that you have for just killing it, really, and the team that you have and the way that you're leading, just so back to leverage, right? Just by picking one particular thing to work on, which would be reviews over a very specific set of topics, which I would love to see. So do you feel like you have enough time to set this up by next Monday when we all meet together?
00:42:53 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
A set of incentive things that I would like to see?
00:42:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It could be incentive. But basically, it's like, what it... What are the criteria that you want to review with each of your team monthly that eventually will be how you can, and you can modify this so this can be rough draft. But what I would like is, yeah, that structure, these are the things that matter most, so I'm going to review it with my team. But also when incentive time comes around, it would make sense that the things that matter most impact incentive. So you don't have to figure out how you would structure it and how you would weigh it and what you would pay. But what are the topics that you would review with each person, and this should be like five to ten elements that you have. And you can rank them right. Here's our five critical and five non-negotiables, and here's our five, know, this is not as important, but this definitely impacts the quality of results type of thing. You think you could have a rough draft that by Monday? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. rough draft. I love the new part to that. Awesome. Awesome. I was thinking about then, you know, let the team know that starting next month and maybe, and maybe it'll be the end of the month so maybe like end of August so you've got time to put this together. And, but then I was thinking maybe we don't want to tell them and tell that you've put something together for sure to let them know what you're going to be measuring, rather than it being like a sucker punch. Hey, I'm looking at this, which it should not be right because they should be very aware of what their duties are. There's a magical thing that happens when people know that they're being scrutinized a little bit more as they perform well, especially if they feel like it's not a negative thing, like someone's paying attention, but they're not, you know, looking for ways to screw up. And you can tell them when they're doing it, like, Hey, I'm going to be looking at these things. And I know that Elsie, you're awesome at this stuff and Cynthia, you're awesome at this stuff. And but I really want to know how to celebrate your wins and really look at where you're shining. But also look for opportunities for improvement and see if there's any kind of training maybe that we can have, because that's the whole point of it, right? We're not trying to ensnare anyone and catch them in a trap. We are trying to help everybody be better and also make sure that we're looking at what we can appreciate in what they're doing. Make sense?
00:45:56 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
00:45:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. What do you think about that? how do you feel? I mean, I basically just kind of said, you should do this.
00:46:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
And I want to know what your thoughts are on it. I think it would be good. I know for Cynthia, it would be good for her to hear that she's doing good because like sometimes we'll just like talk about a case like in my office or whatever. And then before she leaves, she's always like, am I doing good? Like, just want to make sure I'm doing good. So I know she likes to feed back. And then with LC, I mean, we can test it out and see how she likes it. I think it would be good like review every month because like, let's say we set the standard today. Everybody, you know, all the boxes and then like month two, two and a half, things start to like naturally fall off again, which is normal. So it'd be like a good thing that they know like every month. I'm gonna, you know, ask about You know, X, Y, Z Whereas right now it's kind of like we already talked about it and it's up to them how long they want to continue to Work on those things So I might be good to have like a Set date every time, you know once a month that I'm gonna ask them about You know those five to ten key things I'm definitely opening to trying it because They'll also give me an opportunity to know that, you know, we go over this every month.
00:47:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there's no reason for it to Not get done So I do think it's a good idea So couple of things I thought about why you're talking And I know that you're still kind I'm now Elsie's only six months around, Cynthia has been moved around, so really to get a good kind of gauge of things, I would like you to commit to it for a minimum of six months, are you willing to do that?
00:48:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
00:48:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and then the other thing is what I would like you to do, especially so that they feel that this is opening the lines of communication and kind of reinforcing that the fact that this is a safe space is, is there anything, when you, at the end of it, ask them, okay, is there anything that I can do better for you? Do you feel like there's a system or process that needs some improvement? Do you have recommendations about how we can better operate? So it starts with the wins, what they're doing good, a little bit of a coaching session on anything that can be improved, and then we shift the focus off of them, and what can you what can I improve? And then we take it back to the processes. now we're ending on it. It's not a personal note, and then you can just end completely on. Again, you've done an amazing job at these things. Good job, looking forward, you know, to the next one, keep up the good work, that kind of thing so that you can kind of purposely direct the energy almost like conduct, like a music conductor. Right? You purposely starting in a specific spot and ending on a specific note so that it has the the best positive income and doesn't have like any kind of negative impact on the day. Even if there's a coaching session, you kind of take the heat off with making, putting some attention on you and just the business in general. Yeah. Okay. So you have your weekly standup meetings. What is the format of those or what you didn't call them standup, but you We can team meetings. What is the format of that?
00:50:04 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Typically, if I have something that I want to like an urgent thing, I'll usually bring that up first. But most of the time, we kind of just, you know, they have any concerns about certain cases or like a question, I'll just ask them like on any specific cases you guys want to go over. Um, you know, anything that, because if it's like really urgent, obviously we talk about it like right then and there, like else you just message me or come into my office. So the meetings are more things like that come up, but they're not like super urgent. For example, I'm trying to think of an example. Like there was one, there were like denying liabilities, like a word for word to spew. So LC asked me, know, how should we, you know, approach this case? And they know, I tell her, you know, how I would do it. And then for Cynthia, typically, you know, Oscar, are there doctors that are giving you issues on, you know, record requests, are they taken too long? That way I can, you know, reach out personally and try to get it done faster. Sometimes we'll change like how we do things in those meetings. For example, like, I don't know if you know what the health insurance liens are, but Cynthia typically handled those and a few meetings ago. So typically what they'll do is they'll send a form for us to fill out. But I realized when I would do it, I would just call a number. and give them the info that they wanted over the phone and it was much quicker so like in the meeting I was you know advice and they're like hey I tried this because it served responsibly to get those in I was like you know let's try just every time we get one of those requests just call them and give them the info instead of you know filling out the paper faxing him back so in the meetings like if you want to change something how we do things you know we'll go over that in the meetings and then just like general questions like you know are you guys overwhelmed like I always ask Elsie because I know she takes like 90 percent of the phone calls I'll ask her like are you overwhelmed like are you able to are you handling everything do you need me to you know take a few calls this week to you if we get a lot of cases obviously she's gonna make a lot of calls so I Ask her if she needs any help. Typically she's she's able to handle everything. But yeah, let's typically have the meetings go.
00:53:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And are they scheduled regularly?
00:53:18 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
No, there's no set date to just kind of just I'll just let them know like are you all available for meeting like at 3pm on a certain day or something. But I don't have like a set date yet.
00:53:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So do you for sure have them every week?
00:53:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
I mean, we've missed a few weeks like sporadically. But I always talk to them like in the office like they'll talk to us in our office. Cynthia too. But I should probably have like a set date every week to do them.
00:53:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you learn this in the military, right? there is real power in structure because no way. to expect, you can anticipate it, which means you can be better prepared for it, right?
00:54:06 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
00:54:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And generally, when we're better prepared for something, the outcome is better. So my recommendation would be to go ahead and schedule that as ideal of the time as you can, where it is a set time every week, and then, you know, if somebody gets hung up on a call or whatever, then you modify it if need be, but do everything you can not to modify it. And at worst case scenario, you know, everybody stands by if they can for a little bit, or more importantly, what should happen because the only only way that that's not controllable is if there's an inbound call that took a really long time, but even still call control skills can kind of probably help with that. So, like, one of their things would be don't make a call, you know, 30 minutes or so, or don't take a call, 15 minutes or so. before the meeting so that nobody gets stuck on a call, make sure that we can show up and be prepared. then the meeting can have a similar structure to the reviews, not necessarily the same stuff, but a very specific structure. One thing I would recommend is start with the winds. It always kind of helps the mood and the energy, especially if everybody knows that's where we're starting. We're not going to dive right into stress. We're going to say, hey, because I know you're watching your team anyway, right? Hey, you did this good. You did this good. So Cynthia can now start getting her weekly kudos and you could say, Cynthia, you're killing that at this, this, this, you're doing a great job. Thank you. Even if you have to get into the issues, eventually where it comes up like, oh, also I'd like you to work on this type of thing. It started off with the wind and you can end with, you know, again, here's how I can support you kind of thing, which is something you're already doing. So start with the wind. and then you could either get two concerns or questions or the urgent thing. You might kind of play around with that a little bit and find out how that works because here's the thing, you're at the meeting, it's going to get handled. Where it falls in the meeting isn't as important to anything other than the energy of the meeting. So you kind of want to put it where where I like, again, energy sandwiches. I think we talked about these a little bit. I don't remember if we did or not. Good things, bad things, then good things, sandwich. So that's something to think about. And just because it's urgent doesn't necessarily mean it's bad and it may be top of mine and they want to get to the issue quickly. and when still, they don't have to be long winded. want to keep everything as 16th as possible because nobody loves just having meetings. for the sake of meanings. So get in, celebrate the wins, get those kudos, you can do urgent thing, or the concerns or questions, and maybe a concerns or questions specifically for Cynthia, and then concerns and questions specifically for Elsie, and then is there anything that I can do to support you, and then just wrap it up and have a set time. So 20 minutes, 15, 20 minutes, probably is all you need, maybe even less depending on how complicated it is, and also if your team is doing a great job of communicating all week long as the issues arise, you don't want to save it for the meaning. Your business doesn't work that way. So they really should be able to be pretty short. The biggest thing is those urgent things if it's on a planned schedule, right? Because you can definitely have have a we needed meeting to get on the same page. right now and so forth, and that wouldn't be the same thing. The structure would be different. That would just be simply a resolution call, right? But this call, if there's an urgent thing that gets brought to the call, then probably it's already been discussed and you're just, you know, getting to the nitty-gritty of it, and basically getting clarity. So those types of conversations, if and so that dialogue back and forth verbally is what allows for that clarity to happen. So other than that, 15, 20 minutes really should wrap it up, and then they know, especially Cynthia, because I think that she really needs that feedback and she really needs that interaction, especially from what I learned about Lorenz, and she really needs that encouragement. That can be a great time for her to do it, but she also seems to respond well to coaching, especially the way that you're doing. doing it so that gives her everything that she needs and now we start compounding that happening every week and then monthly they get one-on-ones it's a little bit more detailed about specific stats we look at this six months from now I and I don't know when you're gonna hit that incentive period where you guys really get to just kind of blow things up but I think your trajectory is gonna be amazing I think that that consistency and that structure based on what you told me about how you've already applied some structure and accountability but also just support I think I think that you'll probably have some pretty stellar results that you'll notice yeah I'm open to that and everybody else has like structured days I just it's weird like sometimes I'll notice like the beginning of the week is kind of slow
01:00:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
So, I'm like, I don't want to do my meeting on like a Monday and everything happens and then we have to wait till Monday to like have another meeting. But I'm thinking like Thursday would be good because we have our firm meetings out Wednesdays.
01:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you can also have like a Monday morning email that you send out to everyone if you want to that maybe you dropped it on Sunday night and it's just maybe kind of stayed at the union. Hey, this is where we're at. These are our priorities. We'll have our meeting on Thursday and it could just what you could do is take. So let's say you use like an AI recorder or something or use a record and then and put it in the eyes so you can get some notes, have somebody taking notes. Somebody needs to take notes for sure. Otherwise, it's kind of pointless because you want to be able to track the conversations and you want to track the results because if you don't have data, you're not tracking anything, you're giving it to. human error, which there's going to be human error anyway, but it kind of diminishes the power of those conversations when you're not really tracking what's happening from them. So, somebody taking notes really well or use a recorder, and I can show you how to give it to an AI so they can summarize for you, something like that if you want. If you're nerdy, I'm sure you figure it out yourself. So, but I would recommend doing that. And then you can take those notes, instead of sending them out after the call on Thursday or after meeting because you're in person. Monday, hey, here's a recap of our meeting notes. you know, anything that might have happened between Thursday and Sunday night or Monday morning whenever you send it, you can say, here's a quick little update on a specific case or issue or whatever. And just go team go and we'll, we'll meet on Thursday, let me know if there's anything urgent and then you deal with the urgent things as they come up, but those three structure points. So we're talking about monthly one-on-ones, weekly scheduled meetings, Monday, kind of recap of the call and just additional support, clarity, prioritization, that kind of thing. If you have then something that comes up urgent, just tell them. If something comes up urgent, into my office, let's have a call, let's do whatever, let's meet and get it worked out so that it gets moved and processed and it's not weighing heavily on you or anything like that. And if everything else is being managed well and optimized, you should have the freedom to be able to deal with those types of fires and really give it focused energy so that you can handle it. So additional meetings are totally okay. If you want them, if you need them, but the structure and the committed time just kind of helps everybody say alert and focused and accountable with them, you know? Yep. Okay, so let me know how it goes. It's always a plan to start with it. The reality is everybody's a little different, the teams are different, the feedback is different, but what we do want to do is at least give it a chance to work because week to week, everybody's going through different things, feeling different things, different things happen, that type of thing. So if we could commit to this weekly schedule for at least three months, try to be as committed and consistent as possible. If you're just like, it's really networking, this is a problem, this is not the best way to do it, then let's change it up. the odds are that the structure is definitely going to be more beneficial than not.
01:03:51 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah, I agree.
01:03:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I hope you're so glad that you're having these conversations. You didn't answer. just left. Well, you're back and I just bombarded you with a lot of things. But what I would like to know is, and maybe give you some time to think about it, is come back and let me know and you can send me an email. I'd rather not wait until the next one on one. But how you felt about this call, and I think that that's something I need to do. So I'll send you notes about what we talked about and what we're going to work on. But then I would love some feedback from you like, okay, this was useful. This isn't really what I'm looking for. That type of thing so that I can structure this for your best benefit as well. Okay. All right. Do you have any questions?
01:04:54 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
I don't. excited to go back to the office tomorrow and close out the month strong.
01:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I think you're going to do amazing. I'm oh, it's so weird to get emotional about dumb things sometimes. It's not dumb. I like seeing winners win, but I like seeing good people win, especially. And I think that you're on a great track. I think that it's you've got some amazing qualities on a personal level, on a professional level. And I'm really excited to see your career evolve with Sweet Law, because I think that you've got some special qualities that are really good.
01:05:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Well, thank you. I appreciate that. Like I said, I enjoy the meetings because I'm the type of person that'll just pull my head on work and not really talk about certain things. it's good to kind of have you as somebody I can balance ideas off or someone to tell me, know, you should try this because I'm always open to that.
01:05:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would love to be the sounding board too, because I'm sure that you have ideas like that. I know your brain is working, you're just really quiet about it, because you're one of those that like, don't talk about it, about it, you just give about it. sometimes like, you know, that's the general rule for the general population, right? But you always have like your internal people that you should and could kind of talk about and riff with. And I know you've been like the lone wolf, but I'll tell you like, I'm 47, I'm about to be 48. I was always the very lone wolf independent, I can do better by myself, whatever. But I'm learning that as you, the bigger you grow and the more you increase your stewardship, right, the bigger teams are, or the more that you have maybe leadership roles in other parts of life, whether it be parenting or coaching or heading up some type of organization or whatever starting your or whatever to do. Being able to tap into other people's strengths, having conversations, peer-to-peer, mentor-to-mentor, or peer-to-mentor that students to mentor, my brain, it's Monday, anyway, but, but getting in the practice of not talking about all things to all people, not being like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, that drives me nuts, too.
01:07:25 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
01:07:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But really, you just kind of like, I'm trying to figure out the best word to use, but just contemplating, but kind of co-consomplating, know what I mean, riffing back and forth about what you have stewardship over with somebody that has some kind of understanding about it, and it doesn't necessarily need to be the same type of industry, but leadership to leadership, right? Management to management could be law-to-law, that type of thing. So, just because you're still young and bringing these things in and you'll find that there's just a handful, like you'll be lucky if you get even five of those type of people that you can really, really, really be open with throughout your life. But when you find them, talk about what's in your head because the feedback that you'll get will be very different when you're not just listening but when you're really actively participating and sharing what you think and what even you might feel about some stuff. So anyway, that's just my encouragement to not hold back, not to change how you are quiet, had down things like that. But in small moments, just kind of engage a little bit more at a higher level from time to time and only with specific people so that you can really develop your own leadership at a higher level, because I think that, like I said, I think that you've got innate leadership qualities and that whole iron sharpened iron kind of thing. It's there something to it.
01:09:15 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
01:09:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:09:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
would you say sorry as a thankfully, Mark, you know, has you as a tool to help all of us and Yeah, really appreciate it.
01:09:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm glad to do it. I really enjoy it. So anyway, I won't take any more of any more of your time any calm down Another call. Anyway, I hope you have a great day. I'm glad you're back from vacation. I look forward to your report I will send you this email. Maybe not until tomorrow because I have some things. I want to add to it But it but it will be there and then we'll follow up next week Sounds good. All right, you have a great week. Thank you. You too. Thanks. Bye

Good to see both of you guys.
00:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you guys doing?
00:00:27 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
How are you?
00:00:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. Sleepy.
00:00:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Actually, I'm running for nap.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's the time. Yeah, I'm glad we were able to connect today. And Lorenz has been like a year since I've spoken to you, huh?
00:00:46 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, I was thinking about that. Yeah, last time we spoke with Sam.
00:00:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, how are you feeling about your numbers? Well, let's see. I have so many questions, actually. They all fight in my brain and want to come out at the same time. so usually I just trip over them and eventually something comes up. Yeah, so let's see, I'm curious about your numbers, although I've been looking at them because I look at them every week with Mark on a whole, not always individually. And I know we have talked about Cynthia and how she works, but now she's on Pat's team, right? Yeah. So let's start with just kind of a recap of what you remember about what we discussed last year. And anything that it's, I don't know that you might have kind of applied or feel like forgot, didn't apply, whatever, your overall thoughts from your experience last year to now.
00:01:55 - Lorenz Schuerch
Sure. So I think my real life things is, you know, trying to, I think, struggling managing individual members on the team. And we were working on trying to find everyone's strengths. We can't play to their strengths at the time. And so I've been trying to do that and not apply like a preset system on everybody equally. So I'm using everyone's strengths. You know, I split my, I have two teams, essentially. I have Jessica and Mike and John and Viri. And they, it's the same task. All the same tasks get done. the division of the task is a little bit different from one team to another based on their strengths.
00:02:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. And how do you feel like that works for you? What do you notice about? just day-to-day operations. It could be in terms of cohesion on the team, how people feel like just kind of mood, satisfaction, their own satisfaction. There are so many different nuances to how we perform operations that impact us as people, but also as output. How do you feel like that works for your team?
00:03:34 - Lorenz Schuerch
I think they like the general idea. think the issue that we run into a lot is we have these goals and all five of us are very goal oriented, like knowing the expectations and so we all kind of sit down at the beginning of the month, go through the cases we'd like to set, all cases we'd like to close. And then invariably there's always, you know, it's like every day there's like crises that take away our time. And you know, there's clients that are just about to fire you because I never get a call back and I look into the case and, you know, we're talking to that person every other day. And so it's, you know, it's on some of us a little frustrating because it feels like, you know, the biggest, uh, variables that client themselves.
00:04:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Um, so that's interesting too. Let me end that.
00:04:42 - Lorenz Schuerch
Right. Like today I spent an hour with a client who, uh, you know, wasn't happy with her conversation with Mike yesterday and I basically said, well, she had a list of questions. And I went through all of her questions one by one and essentially said the exact. same thing Mike told her yesterday, but she was super happy. And, you know, she loves us now. But yeah, to take an hour out of my time out of the things I had to set out to do today, to talk to her and repeat the exact same thing Mike told her yesterday.
00:05:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, um, that's good information. So I'm going to just kind of recap that the way that it's, well, and we only got to talk once and we've only talked once. We'll around you and I twice, but there was one as a startup and then just a follow up. But so Mark has committed to six months to work together for the three of us. And what I do with my clients is basically just take a holistic approach. So it's a lot of information gathering. And then it's a matter of prioritizing and ranking what we discuss and what we'll have the biggest impact. what's the biggest lover in the business in your day to day operations and things like that. So though we're just starting kind of working together, I've been with Sweet Law for three years. So we've been talking, you know, Mark and I every week for the last three years. And so some of the things that we're working on is going to kind of and overlap. So one of the things that we were talking about trying to figure out is how do we do, how do we create a client ranking system with intake so that we can improve our intake script and process to potentially if even possible because there's such a wide variety of types of cases that you take as well as types of people. And we can't, you know, just cherry pick everything, right? But, but are there ways of determining through potentially profiling and through recognizing through conversation very early through the script, what types of people are going to show up are going to do the work, you know, because there's always a portion where they've got to get us their information and, and do the reporting, will they return our phone calls, will they return our emails, all of those types of things. And so, anyway, not that we have enough information do any of that now, but, but, but all of the things that you share will be useful because then I can go back and we can look at and you guys might find that there are some parallels in what you experience. And one of you might say, well, actually we had that same issue and this is how we did it. So, there's a couple of things just as a general practice that I try to do. with all clients across all business types and it doesn't work uniformly and sometimes it's just not applicable but for example starting up the day proactively versus reactively meaning whatever planning we're doing whatever organizing we're doing and whatever we've prioritized as being the most important thing to accomplish those things get done beginning of the day as quickly as possible so that when we get pulled to the fires you know the things that have to be dealt with in a timely manner have to take time the things that were most important the things that moved the needle the furthest let's say it's a really high high level case right maybe it's a death case and and there's it's higher priority because of the client because of the client's needs and the impact it has in their lives but also what it's worth to sweet-law so What we'll try to figure out is are there ways that we can better structure either our day or the team or our styles of communication with customers or within the team where we have more time and more energy for higher value, higher impact activities, and we're either triaging the lower level stuff. Potentially delegating it. There's a lot of variety. You know how you manage a team, but those are the things that we're going to be looking at, seeing if there's things that we can do to improve. We'll take best practices and then I'll also take some of this information back to Mark and see if there's some feedback where he can help. So point being all of this is discovery. All of this is useful. And that's kind of I just wanted to talk about the approach of how we're going to be doing it since we haven't covered that yet you and I learned and Pat and I did that last week so just make sure this isn't a child it's not in mute everything sorry about that. Okay, so you were talking about. So how many people do you have on your team and I'll have your list right now. I've got four. And remind me who they are please.
00:10:33 - Lorenz Schuerch
So there's Jessica and Mike. And then there's John and Mary.
00:10:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Jessica and Mike are your case managers.
00:10:42 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, John is a case manager. So they're split into two teams. So Jessica and Mike do mostly the Spanish speakers. And then John. And they're both case managers and then. and John and Vary have more of a traditional split where John does most of the case manager asks and Vary does more of a record request and things like that.
00:11:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And those two were kind of a pair, weren't they, that are newer to the team? Very, didn't she come from somewhere else?
00:11:31 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, she came, I think she came from Sweet James maybe, I'm not sure.
00:11:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was thinking not, but did she and John work together before? No. It wasn't them, okay.
00:11:45 - Lorenz Schuerch
But Mike and Justin.
00:11:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mike and Justin, okay. I knew that there was a newer two people that had worked together and kind of came together. Okay. So how do you, when do you have your meetings, how do you meet set your goals like as a weekly, do you have daily meetings, how do you look?
00:12:12 - Lorenz Schuerch
So right now we went through a few iterations and I try to get as much feedback as I get from them. We used to meet as a full team every other day and then the feedback I got was that there's a lot of, when we were going through cases for the other team, the opposite team didn't feel like there's a lot of value so now I'm meeting with individual teams every other day and we kind of do file reviews. We do, you know, if there's any fires to put out, we do those and then we kind of cases along.
00:12:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how long have you been
00:13:00 - Lorenz Schuerch
doing it that way about a month and how do you feel that's going for you it's going good I'm yeah I think I like the idea of doing foul reviews as a team it seems like we're all on the same page at the same time rather than information you know trickling in from different slack channels and we we have a better overall trajectory for each case what what's next you know how do we move this case along faster and you've only been doing this for a month but you you notice the trajectory changing and improving yeah yeah and we have a lot less a lot fewer cases while stagnating
00:14:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that was primarily, would you say, from, um, the file reviews together?
00:14:10 - Lorenz Schuerch
So all five of you doing that? Well, no, because their cases are split up. So like now I do, I do them with the, I do the, okay.
00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So file rules together per team.
00:14:24 - Lorenz Schuerch
So team.
00:14:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um, that's great. I'm, I'm really interested to see how that continues to improve, are you getting good feedback from them?
00:14:38 - Lorenz Schuerch
They like that. Oh, they love it. They, I've gotten really good feedback from all four of them. They say they, this is the, the best thing. just. Let's go. Leader.
00:14:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
job.
00:14:51 - Lorenz Schuerch
Good job. It took some. Several iterations.
00:14:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
As I said. Yeah. That's the thing about growth, though, it does. It takes several. Okay. Good iterations and you know there are different things that can throw a wrench in it just somebody having a major life event can do it um you know there's there's so many different things because at the end of the day it's just it's people and um we've got a lot going on so um let me keep an eye on the time because I want to make sure we we cover everything I'm really I'm really excited for that so you do you remember reading the book multipliers that we talked about yeah um do you feel like you are staying mindful of um looking for ways to kind of nurture and develop leadership in each of your team members I could be better I could I could do better I used to I used to make time to have like an individual kind of like check
00:16:00 - Lorenz Schuerch
with each cheating team member like once a month and then you know people get sick they took some days off and it just kind of fell out you know a few months ago and to get back on the board especially with a new member very she's super super shy and so that's really hard to get it's like pulling teeth trying to get information out of her.
00:16:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel like that's her all the time or that it's a work situation and she maybe doesn't feel safe in in the work environment to speak her mind?
00:16:44 - Lorenz Schuerch
Not necessarily because you've created that but I see what you're saying you know it's hard for me to say at a distance I know that you know I I know she's a single mom with four kids, so I've always tried to, anytime she has a doctor's appointment or something like that, I to be as accommodating as possible.
00:17:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can relate.
00:17:12 - Lorenz Schuerch
Single mom.
00:17:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Exactly.
00:17:15 - Lorenz Schuerch
And so I don't think I've ever said, no, you can't take time off or anything like that.
00:17:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so as a single mom with four kids, sometimes just risk aversion keeps you from talking. Being afraid of stirring the pot a little bit, causing any kind of conflict, causing any kind of work environment hostility. you say things, you know what I mean? don't rock the boat kind of thing, which is why I was asking you, did you feel like it was more of her personality to not be open and say what she's thinking? Or is it that she's a single mom who can't afford to lose her job? and wants to have a good place to work. So she doesn't rock the boat and saying.
00:18:04 - Lorenz Schuerch
think there could be some of that. And I have four kids, so I kind of get it too a little bit, maybe not to the same extent, but, you know, you want stability when you have kids. You're not looking to job hop. So it's abilities, your primary motivator. And so I think there's some of that. I think there's, you know, it's easy to feel when there's not a ton of parents around you. It's easy to feel like you're not sure if people are gonna understand your needs.
00:18:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay, so I'm gonna make a note of just something that maybe we can work on some exercises that we can at least experiment and see if it's something that we can, we can. help with because I look at this as most of us don't want to be job-hopping. Most of us would like to kind of have a place where we can nurture and grow and evolve ourselves as well as everyone around us for a long time. And if that's the case, then it's worth investing in every portion of that experience in terms of the skills, including the soft skills, the communication skills, including the relationships between the team members, all of those things. so being able to tap into each person's super powers, their strength, everything that they have inside of their minds, to the point of like what you read in multipliers. Pat, did we talk about multipliers last week at all?
00:19:53 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
you remember? Yeah, I told you I didn't like to read.
00:19:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's okay. That's okay. we'll have an approach. But the promise of the book was, and I think I did touch this, which is that you want to nurture the leadership in everybody that's on your team, so that basically everybody's playing at their best levels, and that you can create autonomy. Like you were talking about Cynthia, you needed to walk her through some things so that she would know just to get the job done, right? These are the things that don't sit around and wait to be told that type of thing. Like that's multiplying, that's making her more valuable, and there were things that Lorenz did as well to work with her. So that's just the thing is noticing where somebody might be pulling punches a little bit, might be holding back a little bit, or somebody might just not be having the support that they need to be able to to do what they can do. So as we go through our meetings each week, it's just kind of looking and going, oh, I noticed this thing. And some of it is just going to be human nature. None of us are perfect. None of us are going to do amazing at all the things all the time. But some of the things we can make, even if it's a 1% improvement, a 5% improvement, sometimes a 15% improvement. And then you start compounding 1% over here, 5% here, 10% here, another 1 over here. And then all of these different improvements, of them micro level, some of them macro level. And then you look at that a year later, and you look backwards and go, wow, this is amazing. Look at how steady we are at these numbers. Look at how happy everyone is. Look at how well everyone's working together. I used to have to say this to somebody every single week. now I really don't know. I'm to have to say anything to them about it, like little things like that, that just make the quality of your work day better, a little bit less stressed, not just for you, but for your teammates, which tends to end up coming out for the clients, which makes their experience a little bit better, generally will impact the numbers so that your bottom line revenue is higher without feeling more stressed because of it. So, they're very subtle things. There's nothing that you go, holy cow, that's an amazing whiz-bang like, you know, did that come from? It's nothing like that. It's just a little micro adjustment here and there that you look back at it and go, this is better. For example, around your goal last year to start improving your numbers, how are they compared to where you were at the beginning of 2023 versus now?
00:22:56 - Lorenz Schuerch
What's that like for you? I've been trying to work on... I'm quicker turnaround. think I had a couple of first quarter. I had a couple of rough months. One was kind of rough because of money in and then the following one was rough because of settlements, which doesn't make sense. You would think it'd be the other way around. that took a big chunk out of my confidence. I kind of like try to reset myself, reset the team expectations and try to press on the gas pedal. The numbers could be my goal every month as a minimum. of $600,000 and I haven't hit that in a couple of months, so I've been just disappointed. And then there's a couple of factors as of looking at that and State Farm has been just really awful to deal with this year. putting the brakes on everything I've got. Probably out of the 20 cases I have in negotiations right now. 10 of them are State Farm and they're offering less than meds. mean, I don't know about you Patrick, but they're just, they seem to be just slowing everything down, just gumming up the words. And it, it's just, it takes so much time.
00:24:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Have you noticed anything that sounds out about State Farm for you?
00:24:52 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yep. Same compliance as like the cases. Those cases take the most time to get resolved and it's like, and it's crappy results. Yeah, like the, to the firm, it's like the lowest result of like, sometimes I'm like, it's better. We don't even just drop the case and I'd rather put more time into X case that's going to bring in 30K to the firm because, I mean, I just resolved one now. It's like the case settled for nine grand. We're going to take like two, like, I spent so many time just trying to reach somebody there. Clients pissed off because it took so long and the numbers like not even anything, you know, you would think somebody was going to wait five months for a case in negotiation would be getting like at least 10 to 12K in their pocket.
00:25:40 - Lorenz Schuerch
It's to the point where, when I see in the intake channel that the defendant's insurance estate farm, I get anxiety and I'm like, if it's not a broken bone, I don't really want it. Because I know it's just going to be such a struggle.
00:25:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is really. really good to know. don't know ethically that we'll want to avoid those, but maybe, you know, because we talked about client ranking, but maybe there's a case ranking system that we have. And maybe, I don't know, I want to talk and brainstorm this with Mark and see if there's a different way that we handle it. Yeah, that's interesting.
00:26:31 - Lorenz Schuerch
Because I look, the main issue and Patrick talked about is it takes just as long to manage a small soft tissue case as, you know, for a state farm as it does to manage something a little bit more serious for GEICO, for example. But the state farm case, I know if I get the meds, it's like party time, we've we've won kind of thing where with GEICO, we can pop the policies
00:27:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
All day long It's also hard to game plan those state farm cases because even if you do all the right things like that mark has taught us on how to work up a case It like that just doesn't apply what state farm for some reason. I know the friends has cases where you know even The client got injections in the medical You know the offers like not even half the medical expenses like it just doesn't make sense And that's a case that you work up just like any other case would and you know The other one settles and gets done and this one you're still stuck like asking the most basic questions to the adjuster like why is your offer X amount and you get like Seven eight of the state farm cases now You know based on marks the stuff he sees this case It doesn't have any negotiations for X amount of months. The client's pissed off. It just snowballed into the time sucking machine. And then when it does get resolved, it's not even worth half the time that we spent on it. But to completely bar every state farm case from coming into the firm, I don't know if that's the right move.
00:28:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think it would be practical. We can't lose that many, but we might be able to change the way that we process them. And I don't know, like, even maybe a team or a system dedicated to it, or just even just having an awareness. There sometimes there might be a conversation that Mark can have. Maybe there's a representative. I don't know, but...
00:29:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
It starts with having awareness.
00:29:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Has there even been a conversation among the attorney is or with Mark that state farm stands out so badly?
00:29:09 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, every week, every week.
00:29:12 - Lorenz Schuerch
I can bring it up every week.
00:29:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What does he say about it?
00:29:16 - Lorenz Schuerch
He says, well, it's you know, you can always have someone else second voice and things like that. I've had other people second voices. had Patrick second voice. I've had Sam, I've had Nick. And usually it results in an additional thousand bucks. And it's I'm not going to like bulk at that because I know if we get enough extra thousand dollars eventually builds up or whatever. So go ahead, sorry. And I feel like. Like where's my value as an attorney to the client?
00:29:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:29:58 - Lorenz Schuerch
If I'm getting them. the meds paid for, basically.
00:30:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, at the very least, one thing I wanna do, and I don't think it's in our, I don't know if it's in our reports, it's not on my dashboard, but I would like to see matters by insurance companies and look at what the volume is across insurance companies in terms of how many cases we get how many times we hit max policy limits. Just drill down on that a little bit more. We'll be interesting. And sometimes, so to the point of getting disheartened, sometimes you just have to put things in perspective and just say, is it, and not let it get to you. pause, you know, there's there's all kinds of science on the psychology when you just you focus on on the problems, especially the things that you can't control, it impacts the rest of your mood, it impacts your energy, it's going to impact your cognitive abilities, simply because your mind is over here wrestling the frustration.
00:31:24 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, but the metric that we're measured by is our average fee.
00:31:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, I get that and so but here so so this is part of why I want to have the report so I can look at statistically if everybody is averaging roughly the same amount of state farm cases so then we would look at is there any possible way and I doubt it that somehow intake is you know one team gets more of that and one team doesn't it's not very likely that that's the case. So that means that if everybody's getting right roughly, and throughout the year, it probably is. The same amount of state farm cases, then it really is not a determining factor, right? Because you would all be dealing with the same problem. And so, if Samantha, so I'm looking, I asked Mark this and I did not get the question, but you guys get to see each other's numbers, right? You know what everybody's attorney fees are, roughly. so I'm going to look at this for this year. Let me update it. So, Lorenz, for the year of 2024, your average attorney fee is 11,000. We're not going to look at Mark or Nick, because obvious reasons. Pat, you're at 8.8k, Sam's at 17k, Tyler's at 11k. So, you and Tyler are tied Lorenz. If I look at that for last month for June, which is a very small pool and not really a good way to look at it, for last month your 8.4k, Sam was 12k, Tyler was 9.3k, Pat, your 7.6k. A month is, I mean, it's not a good sample size because of how long your cases take to work up and to settle. And let me look at record counts. So, wait, that was last month. wanted to do this for the year. So, cases closed by team for this year. Lorenz 125 for you. Pat, you're at 59. is a 120, so learns you close more cases. Again, how long they start is not necessarily a good thing. Just a second, please. have a child. Teenagers, and I work from home, so like, thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Okay, so, click cases close by team. Lorenz, 125, is for 2024, Pat, 59, 120, then, that number's 100% not correct, gross the, oh, that's by state, I'm fine. Resolution by team. My average attorney, we already did that. Dropouts and subouts. Lorenz, your percentage of subouts. Let's see, subouts as they fired you or is that dropped out?
00:35:23 - Lorenz Schuerch
Well, subout is when they hired different attorneys.
00:35:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
difference I guess. So, your percentage is rough. That can't be right. Hold on. Let me make sure this year. I'm not positive. Okay, okay. I need to change this report because I want to see it per all the cases that you have. But for the year, you only had five subouts. Samantha had 13. Pat had... three. Tyler had seven. Now, there's a lot of reasons that can happen. It can be your performance. It could be the insurance. It could be multiple things. And they're blaming us for it, not necessarily because of something you and your team have done. But there's a lot of things to look at in terms of your quality and performance and how you do the job. It isn't just attorney fees. That is what your incentive pay is. But all of these things impact sweet lot. Getting subbed out. And I can't so one on sub out. And one out. Percentage for cases. And policy limit for that case, potential loss, because I think that we should be measuring the loss for team two. And then this isn't about penalizing anyone. It's about making sure that we're evaluating everything. So, let's say that your attorney fees are lower, first of all, you're operating primarily in Arizona, and I don't know. All of you are, so Samantha waved into, I don't remember New Mexico, I think she's New Mexico. Who's doing Texas, do you remember? Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. So, you know, there's different things impacting your numbers, and all of that needs to be taken into account. So, at the end of the day, Really, the thing is we want to look at each of those numbers, just your attorney fees, but we want to look at the sub-out rate. We want to look at policy limits. We want to look at how often is your team showing up and doing well, how happy are they because that has an impact on the likelihood that we're going to have to replace somebody soon. We have to replace somebody because the pod leader, the attorney, is burning people out. It's very difficult to find good people to hire. We are constantly looking and we go through a lot just to find one new attorney. So, again, my approach is holistic. I'm looking at everything in Sweetlock top to bottom, never just the bottom line. I'm looking at each individual, I'm looking at them as a person. I'm looking at all the costs, all the impact. act, all the wins, all the losses, and and how it affects everything because ultimately each of these things makes an impact on how profitable it is, including how happy everybody is. So if you learn to measure all the things that matter, not just your attorney fees, but like I think you should be happy with the fact that your subout rate is so low, I think that that's important. I think that that means that you're probably doing something good. However, what I don't have and what I need and why I need to change this report is I don't have that in relationship to how many cases you had this year. So Samantha, if she, so her subout rate is more than double yours, but if her case rate is more than double yours, then she's roughly in the same boat, you know what I but. Yeah, so anyway, those are some of the things to look at, Pat, you're coming up and now you've got those goals, trying to, so I'm just going to tell you Lorenz, Pat's gone in for being the best attorney in the firm, so we've got some competition in here, but I think it's good, I think it's good. I think how we handle the competition, like Samantha, she's leading in attorney fees, but when Pat asks her questions, she answers them, and thoroughly, really supportive in answering that. And so ultimately, if all of our goal is, how do we make the sweet law be the best place to work, the best place to go for help? Well, you know, I think that's winning, right? job security is, if you show up and you're continually improving, maybe you're not improving an attorney fees for... or three months. But maybe what you did was improve your team processes. You improved. You made sweet lot better. And that's important. So we're going to have those conversations too. And also going to take that and report back to Mark, like the fact that you figured out through multiple iterations and different processes and effort and communicating with your team that your trajectory improved because you split the teams instead of having people sitting around, wasting their time on meetings that are irrelevant to them, doing bio reviews per your groups. That's important. Sweet lot was improved because of that effort. So maybe it doesn't have an immediate impact on the attorney fees, but it will over time, 100%. There's no way that's not going to. And if we get to continue working together, so here's the other thing.
00:41:56 - Lorenz Schuerch
Q1 here. Yeah, I guess I might. I am competitive, but I'm more competitive with myself, so always compared to myself to one career.
00:42:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's best way to be, honestly, because that's the only race you can run, but I like both of them. I think ultimately that's the only race you can control and that you're really actually in, but with Pat, know, wanting to get the highest numbers, like I get that too. The bottom line is whatever motivates us, that's what we need to tap into. That's what we need to be working with. So what everybody has different drivers, and as long as there's intrinsic motivation and drive, that's all we need. There are people that don't have it. They're only externally motivated to please other people, to get accolades, to earn money, but mostly so they can show up things, not because they want to improve themselves, not because they actually want to be the best at anything they just want to be. he perceived as the best. Pat wants to be good at what he does. You want to be good at what you do. And that's valuable. But I want to make sure that you did hear me. All of Sweet Law is slow and Q1.
00:43:13 - Lorenz Schuerch
Did you know that? No.
00:43:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Every year, I've watched it. Every year, every year, have a little bit of a freakout period. Mark has a little bit of a freakout period. And then everything turns around and we're like, oh yeah, this is a pattern. But I will tell you that Mark didn't know it was a pattern because Mark didn't track his numbers. And when I would ask him for his numbers, he would say, well, I think it's this. And I think it's that. And I said, none of what you say adds up. So how about we go get that information? Yeah, but it's a pain in the . don't know how to get it.
00:43:51 - Lorenz Schuerch
And like, well, let's figure that out, Mark.
00:43:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so we did. And so now we've got some data and the more that we dig into it. Um, so we'll go get some information and all of a sudden, you know, nothing's really happening and then Mark sends an email because he can't sleep a night because he was thinking about something and he had an epiphany and he dug into some numbers and he's like, I just realized this. And then we have a big change and there's a big improvement and so really digging into all of these different numbers makes a difference. But something that I really love about numbers is it kind of takes the emotions out of it and in a good way. Um, because you see what's real numbers don't lie. Numbers tell you the truth. So if you see some good numbers, what do you know? You know that that's, that's a real thing. That's a good thing. If you see a number you don't like, it's also a real thing, but that's an opportunity to improve. And iteration upon iteration changes happen and occur. So, that's what we're looking at. So one thing I'm really excited about though by talking to you guys as I'm realizing how we can improve our reporting which is going to be really useful for us and what we're doing with Mark which will somehow come back and improve things for you including potentially improve because I don't know that we have the best incentive program that there is I want to make sure that you guys are incentivized for all the good work that you do including if we're minimizing dropouts and subouts I think that that should be part of it. Especially if the reason that we're getting subbed out is lack of communication and so this was something that really isn't managed super well I think across any team. I think it's getting better but we would have some cases where nobody been communicated with for two and a half months which is not acceptable and until I I was asking questions and probing and digging into that. That was just like that and it was unknown. So there's always opportunity to improve. And just by having the conversations, we figure out ways to, because you guys have a lot of watch, you have a lot of things to manage, you have a lot of people, a lot of processes, a lot of conversations that will fry the average person's brain every day. So dropping the ball is kind of part of the job, it's going to happen. we're trying to do is create the systems that minimize ball dropping. know what I mean? That also maximize making sure that we're spending the most time on the most important things, the highest leveraged impact type thing. And that we're making air pre-person on the team as potent as possible so that everybody's winning. So, um, okay, we've got about 15 minutes left and then Lorenz, um, before I forget, let's just go ahead and get out next week's schedule because next week will be just you and me.
00:47:21 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, I thought we said next Wednesday, same time.
00:47:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did we? Okay, uh, that will work. Let me just, I think I just didn't schedule it yet. Let me duplicate this. What is the calendar? No, that's not it. That will work. That will work. You don't have to deal with All right. Okay, so that's done. So Pat, Mr. Patrick, um, have you had any thoughts since our conversation last week?
00:48:11 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
The main thing that stood out was like the male, female dynamic. Um, it was obviously two of my team members or females. Um, we kind of touched on like how the male dynamic can help them like a camera with what you said. But like, I remember you talked about the dynamic between male and female team. Um, I want to see how I can use that to maximize. Um, because the team is super respectful. Um, you know, we don't have any issues. Sometimes I feel like there might be issues with the female case manager and answering to a male attorney, I'm not sure why, but that was like the main thing that really stood out. So I wanted to see if you had any thoughts on like naturally what's the dynamic like.
00:49:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So just even observing dynamics between people, there are going to be different things, the female female dynamic, especially if they're super strong, A type personalities in the workforce can be very either they're going to be very supportive of each other or tear each other apart. There's not a lot of middle ground generally speaking. So the first thing is just observing what kind of dynamics exist. Who do do two people interact with each other and seem to be more open when they interact with each other versus interacting with other people? Do you notice any tension? Do you notice more forthcoming, more holding back? type of thing. What I was saying about you is that you have a, so the way that you approach Cynthia, I think Lorenz is the same type of way, is that he wants to bring out the best in people. You want to support them. That doesn't exist everywhere with every person. Not every female comes to work and feels safe, either because of anybody that work or one. And men of the, you know, not necessarily safe, but it impacts, it'll show up in a woman a little bit differently in terms of how much she will lead and share what she knows is gonna help things. So one of the things that I do and have done for several CEOs is higher higher. and install a right hand person for them, more than an assistant, somebody who kind of like pushes back on them a little bit and says, did you think about this? Hey, I noticed you said you were going to do this, but you're not doing this. That type of thing, right? Now, that was what they were hired for. That was their exact role. That was what was wanted from the CEO, somebody to push back little bit and hold them accountable because there's nobody doing that in the business. And we all need somebody to hold us accountable. But without fail, even though that person was told clearly, please call out when you see issues, please call that out every single time as often as possible. And even when they did that and they never got pushed back, even when they were fully respected every time, it took years for them to feel safe enough to do the job well. Because generally speaking, That's not how the rest of the world operates. Most people don't want to be how accountable. Most people don't want to be called out even respectfully. There's ego involved, right? You both come off to me as someone who is not operating from a you're coming off a little harsh or something like that. But more importantly, the energy that comes from that is that you're safe to be around. You care about the people that work for you and work with you. Here's how I knew that from you, Pat. Without being prompted, you were talking about how you noticed Cynthia was not doing X, Y, don't remember all the details of it, but I remember you're like, I tried to give her space so that she could just do her thing and not, you know, control her basically. But you noticed that. that wasn't working. And so you knew that she needed more support, she needed guidance, she needed to be directed. And so you did that. But what you told me was I didn't want to hurt her feelings. I didn't want to, you know, cause her any problems or make her uncomfortable. So I just took my time and this is the approach that I took. So you showed that you were concerned with how she felt and that you took the time to modify the way that you showed up in order to create a safe space for her. I'm going to tell you, and Lorenz, I think that you would do the same kind of thing. I think that that's how you operate primarily is being concerned with giving people what they want. And you've given other signals like that, same thing with Cynthia, noticing that she's process oriented and everybody else is kind of free. so you gave her some tasks to allow her to create those processes. also when your team told you, look, we don't like wasting our time, like, okay, let's make a modification split this and I'll just go ahead and do two file reviews even though maybe it's more tedious for you, you were there to lead your people the way that they wanted to be led. What I'm trying to explain to you guys and what I really want you to hear, and this is not a platitude or patronizing or anything, that is not how most leaders operate. Most people are more bosses, they're not leaders. You both show up as leaders because you care about how the people that work for you feel you want them to be happy and successful and even if it's not altruistic, even if the only reason you're doing that was because then they'll perform better for you and you get better paid. Let's say that was all it was and I know that it's not. It still gets the same end result, they're still taking care of. So paying attention to how people respond to you. I'm noticing, for example, if Viri doesn't maybe answer questions if you ask her how things are going. want to drill into that with you next week a little bit more Lorenz and get the details so that maybe I can kind of figure out what's going on a little bit and we can find a way for that. But generally speaking, that's going to be that she's received signals from other bosses or leaders that have said, you know, if you tell me too much, it's going to annoy me and I'm going to give you some annoyed energy and you're going to feel that tension and that hostility and she has taken that and gone, you know what, I'm going show up, I'm going do my job, I'm going to go home and that's it. And I'm not going to rock the boat because I don't want to deal with feeling threatened with my job or anything like that. So, um, paying attention to these types of things, being aware of them, and also paying So guys, what I want you to understand is knowing how unique you are, that you have an opportunity to really improve, especially when you have females working on your team. Because you are safe, because you do care, you can probably get better performance out of them than they've ever had before. But if you want to know the impact that it makes, and maybe this doesn't motivate you, but I'll tell you this anyway, you can help them show up better in the rest of their lives completely by showing them that there are safe people in the world where they can make mistakes, they can say the wrong thing, and they can still be okay. You know what I mean? Because if you have people willing to make mistakes out loud, then the mistakes can be seen in the open, which means they can be corrected gently, but they can be corrected. Whereas if you have people who feel like they need to cover up their mistakes. Who need to lie about them or just not show you, you know, what's weak within them? You can't correct it. You can't improve it. Does does any of this make sense? Yeah, absolutely so I'll give you an example of where I learned and then we can kind of close it and I was inquire for like ever and and We would be learning new songs and they were difficult songs and my my Quaritage was always trying to get us to sing louder and So he could hear so he could pick out the part so he could see like he's I could hear there's an off note But I don't know where it's coming from because every time I walk by everybody's mumbling and they're not really right So I'm just like, you know what I'm sure you can imagine I was loud I Don't do quite or settle very well, but um, so I did that and it was frustrating because I would get corrected but I would get corrected quick and you know what happened after that, I nailed the part and then I'd be a section leader and everybody would start listening to me. So when I would join in any other choirs, church choirs, whatever adult activities and every other thing, I'll just be loud. I'll just make my mistakes out loud. I have opinions, I'm very secure in my opinions and loud about them when I say them and confident in them, knowing that if I'm wrong, somebody's going to correct me and I will not like that, by the way, do not like being corrected. But I prefer being corrected to being wrong perpetually. Do you know what I mean? So I'm okay with being confidently wrong so that somebody who knows better can observe it and go, yeah, no, that's not right, Tina. This is actually what you need to do. So I try to create that kind of space for people that work with me. as well and encourage them, just go do things. If you make a mistake, we're going to figure it out together. But if I don't have to tell you and train you on every little thing because you're not afraid to try it, you're not afraid to problem solve, you're not afraid to explore, you're not afraid to go look for other solutions and implement them knowing it could cost us money, it could cost us time. But knowing that the end result is we're going to get more knowledge and we're going to have a deeper understanding of how these things work and you got it for yourself and you made yourself more valuable to me. But I'm paying you the same amount of money. Go learn, go explore, go figure some things out. But then when they do that, they start getting more brave and they want to explore more things and they want to try more things and they bring more things to the table and then they stay with me for years and I get to keep benefiting from this all because I was like, go ahead and make mistakes. Like it's powerful. But, you have to make it very clear that it's a safe place to make mistakes. It's a safe place to tell what you really think, as long as it's done respectfully. And if it's done disrespectfully, then you just correct it respectfully. But we're looking at this long term, your people evolving. And the other thing that I'll tell you is that these skills and these things, they'll help you as parents, if you're a coach, they'll help you as a friend, any other place you show up as a leader. When you learn how to create a safe space for people, but also help them be their most powerful selves, everything that you do, everywhere that you serve, everywhere that you show up and have any kind of interactions, improves because you will be one of the few places in the world where somebody is safe to show up and have some room to make mistakes. So that they can explore and. and learn. And it's, I think it's pretty awesome. I mean, I love watching people grow. love knowing that I had a little bit of a part of it. And the two of you have both demonstrated that you have that kind of interest and awareness and ability. And Pat, you've got a strong like shoulder spore things just kind of roll off you. Lorenz, I think you get a little bit more anxious and stressed out about it, but you still take it into you rather than putting it on them. And so, and if we can teach you how to let stuff roll off you a little bit better, that would be good. But at the end of the day, you both offer very unique things to your teams where there's a lot of potential and growth. And I think that Sweet Law is going to be, I think Sweet Law is blessed for having both of you. But if we can keep working on these things together, I'm looking at some awesome stuff coming down the road.
01:02:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
and some good numbers and of course you know you want to get that extra money and you've got those goals so we'll get to them too through the people that you're working with and just through day-to-day ops so um Pat before we wrap up so we were talking about dynamics beyond female dynamic and you said that's what you were thinking about do you have more questions do you have more thoughts like did you want to dig into that a little bit more now um i had another can i give you like another thing i was thinking yeah um how to keep them motivated because obviously like their cap on you know financial like improvement is kind of limited because just the nature like we have our licenses and we're attorneys and like your salary or whatever can just you know it's kind of like sky's the limit whereas with you you know, non-licens staff here, it's kind of like, there's kind of a ceiling, um, and I'm sure they know that, but they, which is why I applaud and I appreciate all the work that they do, because I mean, Lorenz and I was like, they take a big blunt of the work that we don't want to do, you know, just even taking the calls every day, it's like, one day if Elsie's not here, and like, it kind of falls back on me, it's like, pay this woman what she needs to be paid to be happy and keep her here as long as possible, because like, you know, they really do a lot of the work that, you know, as an attorney at some point you want to negotiate and get the settlements, which is the fun part. So just like trying to keep them motivated and happy to be coming to work every day, because like I said, they do a lot of the work and, you know, I don't know how much they make, but in obviously Lorenz and I have like the room to really grow whereas other staff members is kind of like a range because for me it was in that position like I don't know if I would have lasted as long as, know, people have doing the work that they do.
01:04:19 - Lorenz Schuerch
So what I've done with my team is I've made my growth commence written affairs so we have certain bonus ladders where if we bring in this much money that month I'll take money out of my paycheck to bonus the people that and then that way they feel just as invested in the success as I do.
01:04:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. But I thought that that was that the incentive program, so I guess maybe I was just probably thinking about intake because I know intake. takes incentive is combined like there's no way to separate it because each of them can touch a case multiple times before it becomes a case and before it's turned over to you because I've been trying to figure out how do I create some separation so that we can really measure and reward according to effort because not everybody shows up the same and I think that it should be based off of effort and ability but I didn't realize that the pods were separate like that that the case managers and assistants don't get incentive pay is that correct like not unless you're too mean right so that's some questions that I have because I would like to see that be consistent across sweet law I think that that would be better for the company but we've not had this conversation would like to have that with Mark. So that was a good point, Pat.
01:06:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
will bring that up.
01:06:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My staff hasn't complained about, hey, this is just something internally that I was. No, yeah, yeah. That's good. I'm glad you brought that up and I'm glad you're thinking about that because I would think the same thing. know, if you're incentivized and they're not like, there's obviously ceiling to how much you can ask for them when they don't get more for it. I, for sure, I'm motivated by incentives and if I'm not getting more for working harder, guess what I'm not going to do.
01:06:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Like, don't go put that up for somewhere else that comes back. the end of the day, was not going to want to get paid more, know, but there's just one of those things I was thinking about because, you know, on those hard days, when you, you know, on by clients all days, it's like, I'm going to come to work the next day and then, you know, what's my financial future like, you know, whereas for me and Lorenz, you know, we can suck it up and, you know, get yelled at by clients, but you have a really good month and it's like, You know, this is why why I put up, you know, yeah, so just you know I want to make sure that For the long term the team is happy and you know despite their They've been like in certain range. They can have other things to look forward to and be happy about Well, that's like a couple hundred dollars incentive every month.
01:07:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know it's not very much that takes to Yeah People yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, so that's good was there anything else?
01:07:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I know I didn't answer that I've been to look into that I don't think so I think the The three of us on the calls would be helpful because I can get some more detail on how Lorenz you know organizers team and everything because I'm just free styling I see some stuff that Sam does Tyler does from Lorenz But obviously these are more in-depth calls so No, I'm excited.
01:08:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. I'm glad and I'm really glad that you said that because I wasn't sure how I want to structure this. I thought that one on one a month and then to all of us meetings a month would be best. So I think that that would be good. Still that way we can talk about your team specifically on an individual basis. So that's what the one on one call would be to really dive into the nuances of your specific people. And then twice a month, you could really just do some back and forth best practices digging into Sweet Long General.
01:08:36 - Lorenz Schuerch
So how do you feel about that Lorenz? Does that work for you? That's great. I'm always, I always want to grow. I always want to do better. So I'm happy to just follow your lead and hopefully settle off. A lot more cases and have happy teams.
01:08:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. I think, I mean, just the thing that you did with the file review, I'm really looking forward to seeing how that goes. Pat, your team is going to be growing eventually. mean, you're definitely gun, and I'm watching your line grow. So it's good. I think you guys are awesome. I'm so excited to be doing this. Thank you for spending some time with me and letting me come in and do this work with you guys. So Lorenz, I will meet with you next week. And then Pat and Lorenz will will reconvene, not next Wednesday, but the Monday after that at 3 p.m. Sounds good.
01:09:37 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
You send emails, right?
01:09:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Every time like we're about to have a meeting? Yeah, you should get a notification through Google. And I have it set by default to send multiple reminders. But I don't know that the multiple reminders go to you. So, starting a day or yesterday. So what I'll tell you. though is so in the beginning we didn't have a set time but we're going to so what you can do is once I set that recurring Monday meeting call which I'll do by next week at the latest because we're doing Wednesday next week what you can do is go into your calendar and set up your own reminders to be whatever frequency level you want but I have mine going one day before just to kind of remind me it's a thing I do with all of my meetings and then four hours before and 15 minutes before just so that I remember because I've got a lot going on so I need other reminders but if you need anything else if you want other kinds of reminders let me know I probably will start getting to some point where there's some follow-up questions that I'll ask through email just to make sure that we're on track but right now there's a lot of just downloading everything from you guys so we're not getting to that point yet uh yeah so any other questions did you fix your pool my daughter is working on it right now because i just work hard yang are you in california no i'm in northern southern cal southern organ i want to say northern california southern organ southern yeah look now why is it more again oh we're at beaverton oh that's much nicer i live in the hictown and i cannot wait to move i'll be moving though every single night because i like oh we're at um probably the scott still area it's either that or vegas but yeah stop still it's very nice yes i like it very much all right you guys well i hope you have an amazing fourth of july i hope you have a great weekend and i look for

Hello.
00:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hello. How are you guys saying? Good.
00:00:17 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
How are you?
00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Theotic but good. It's pretty much always chaos. I kind of like it that way though. My daughter's got me a hat that says Boss of the Chaos.
00:00:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You're one of those people that tries in chaos?
00:00:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Not really but I do take some joy in it from time to time and then I like 15% chaos and the rest of it is recovering from the chaos. But it's like a battery pack for me. I'm just like I don't want people. I don't want people. people. And then I get to my people and I'm like, Oh, like the sun and, and then I go home, I'm like, what did I say? What did I do? I just want to like relax and what to be or read or do like whatever work out. I have to get the physical energy out of me. Where's my Patrick? got my Lorenz. Where's my Patrick? Beyond Tom being anti social. This is not okay. Yeah, he might be on a call. I suppose we could tolerate that.
00:01:33 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Let's see.
00:01:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

She's strange.
00:02:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. Good. Adversity is like that. It doesn't matter what it is. It's always this. It's a fog and it's almost like a echo chamber of misery like this. Give you a ribbon in the house of mirrors.
00:02:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:02:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Everything is reflected back to and it's like nothing else exists. But then you get out of it and you're in the real world again. I feel like adversity can be like that sometimes and trauma can be like that. We're like, everything that's in you is what's reflected back to you constantly. if everything that's in you is hurting. That's, that's all. your experiences and then all of sudden you come out of it and yeah so um what's up Patrick hello how you doing you get to fade on yeah I get it every week yeah what do you think I look like with a fade I'm already annoyed by how short my hair is right now all right okay um wait Lorenz remind me how old your kids are uh fourteen twelve nine and five are they excited for Trunka treating you guys do that well yeah we do Trunka treat then we do the our our neighborhood goes all out on Halloween's and yes my we do it we're doing a chili cook off next Wednesday and my kids are fourteen and seventeen but they're still hooking it up and dressing up and yeah yeah my wife told my fourteen-year-old that he was two
00:04:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
to, uh, to dress up and I was like, don't you dare, right?
00:04:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, no, no, there's, there's no such thing.
00:04:09 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Maybe this might be the last one for him.
00:04:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, it wasn't that one. No, it a Viking. I was like, what?
00:04:17 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Last, last year he dressed up as Maverick from Top Gun.
00:04:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice.
00:04:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Got a lot of girls looking out and I'm pretty excited about that.
00:04:27 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
That'd be the cost.
00:04:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Smooth, right? It has me like, what? That takes that out. That's funny. All right. So anybody been thinking about what we were talking about last week? Do you remember what we were talking about last week? I'm like, you paused Lorenz because it was your idea you brought us a table. Patrick, what were we talking about last week?
00:04:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Using Slack to find a way to organize tasks and checklists for the teams to go through. Only get cases.
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So did you happen to have any thoughts about that after the fact?
00:05:07 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I think it would be helpful, but I would try to keep it as basic as possible. Because I feel like everybody has their own little thing that you can add. If we created an Excel spreadsheet and send it around the firm, I feel like it would just get very, very long as far as what everyone thinks should be on there. But I think a general checklist is good because we just get so many cases, or if somebody needs to step up, maybe they're not used to doing certain roles. And they can just kind of see what needs to be done at a certain stage. Yeah.
00:05:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How about you to run any thoughts about it since last week?
00:05:52 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, so actually Slack does have a function task manager function. That's built-in, it's called lists. And you can use the project manager template. And it allows you to assign tasks to people, track the progress, can be working comments on it. It's pretty neat. I've been using it, rolling it out is going to take a little bit of time just because I have to create a new list, essentially, for each client. And I tried to do it during our review meetings. That's taking a little bit too long to do that, to do that live. So I'm going to make some time, I already scheduled some time during soccer practice on Thursday night to get going on those. But yeah, I agree with Patrick. Pretty simple. Otherwise, it just becomes another Mesh like we had with little I when I first came where every time You know a new a new case came on we have 22 emails and 22 tasks and It's just oh no one looked at him. So and The good thing with that is that you can Schedule tasks out So it's not all due today. It's not like and so And you can Grade the importance of the task so that if they don't get to it they can Get to it tomorrow Good.
00:07:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I talked to Mark about it and he said that Lidify has workflow automation also and so we are gonna get on a meeting only I'm going to get to be able to be there too and we want to talk to somebody there about slack and see because the remember I told you this is going to be an iterative process. It'll be for the same reason that you talked about Patrick and also Lorenz is that we don't want to create more problems than it solves.
00:08:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
We don't want to create a bottleneck that wasn't there before.
00:08:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, or just overwhelm. The whole point is to improve efficiencies, not to create more more tasks, more issues, more noise. So it will probably be wrong the first time to three or four. So that's where we need your leadership and having conversations with the team in working through it and be like just use it, tell me what's wrong, what doesn't work, so that we can fix it. This isn't, we are going to do something and you're going to do it. like it or not. Like we're exploring growth and innovation to improve and the specific goal is to improve efficiency but mentally as well. So we've got this entire lag time of task switching, right? And we have this list of basically 20 tasks that have to be accomplished across hundreds of cases. Your volume isn't quite there yet, Patrick, but it will be. And the goal is to increase the volume for everyone. So that scale, you know, there's a ceiling somewhere as to how much we can accomplish and how much we can do well, as well as what's the quality of life day to day for us doing the business. know, our human resources are everything. There is no business without human beings. And we all have emotions and we have limitations and things like that. So just a reminder, the goal of the system is to optimize for the human resources, right? It isn't prioritizing the task so much as the person who is completing the task and kind of building the Iron Man suit around them so it has to be compatible. Now, it is not going to be equally compatible with all people on the team. That's just the way it is because we're all different but we do need to be fairly consistent. Where we can make alterations per person without breaking a system, we will look for those opportunities and I want you to always be thinking about that and working with people. the alteration is just your approach. in getting them to use it, understanding what their intrinsic drivers and motivators are and how you can align what already drives them with the system and how the system can support what is driving them. Does that make sense? So you can keep exploring if you want to right now but maybe don't go whole hog on it right now till we have the conversation with the litify experts. Right, want to invest a ton of time into this if it's going to be a different system anyway. Yes, because so there's a couple of things that are going on. So we've been talking about reports this is kind of an ongoing process mostly due to the fact that we have a lack of frequency and conversations. So which reminds me, I got to follow up. So A lot of it goes through email. have infrequent touches throughout the week trying to work with a guy who works on the little by reports, and then we need to have a same page meeting, but also Mark was a lot like there's just a lot going on. So the pace of this is kind of slow, and I want to come back to that in a minute to talk about what you guys need to do in order to create and maintain and potentially increase momentum. In the meantime, but so we've got the person who creates reports who is not litify, he actually works his brothers and attorney, and they have a firm and so he's nerdy and was figuring it out for himself because litify is not great at reporting. They build this infrastructure, but it doesn't work well. It's very clunky. I don't expect them to be a whole lot better when it comes to the automations, but because Mark pays a ton of money. That's where he wants to start is having conversation with them. And if I get to be there, then I'm going to probe a whole lot and see what we can do. And then the other thing I'll do is take that back to our reporting guy who's also been digging into Letify and see what we can do. So this is probably going to take a couple of months to even get to one like version one that is any kind of really useful. So I want you to kind of put that in perspective. And then additionally, we're going to have a conversation with Slack and because Slack knows Slack really well, Letify knows Letify really well. The two of them know each other a little bit probably, but being able to talk to the experts on each one and then come back and come back to you guys and create that version. The way that the conversations are spread out, we're probably looking at a couple of months as a time frame, essentially 90 days. Roughly, the first iteration of every type of project happens between 60 and 90 days, almost consistently across the board. So keep that in mind. In the meantime, I always like a quick and dirty version of the system and it starts with just awareness. So we have the one spreadsheet that we created, which is all the types of tasks that have to be done per case, and who works on them, right? And then just touching the cases and looking at it and making sure we are on track. So that mostly comes down to file review and scanning quickly. So this is what I want to talk to you guys about. How has that been going for you? love to hear from kind of forensically, like low level forensically. that in terms of what's been happening, what's the anatomy of the case, like our list is basically the anatomy of the case, right? so we know that there is kind of an order of operations, something can happen simultaneously, and that we decided on a particular amount of frequency that for sure nobody should be going even a week without at least getting a text message like, hey, just checking in with you. How is all of that going for you?
00:15:28 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
That's good. mean, basically when you do the file review, it's like our list, but you're just doing it kind of in your head or you have something that's basically what you're doing. You're making sure that, you know, based on how long we've had the case, certain things have been done or are pending to be done. So that's what I do. I go through and say, okay, this case, we just got it and so called done, okay, insurance request, liver, insurance, set up a treatment. basically what it's going to be for like the newer cases, middle of the case, usually it's about treatment if they're going to continue or if it's been done and it's a negotiation and I already know about that. And then the really old ones, it's more so usually me just negotiating, it's just taking a while or that's to go to litigation or something. So it's good, I still have to remind the team. Like if I see they haven't been contacted for a while, I'll just send a text message. I'm not like coming, send a task to the team and then wait for them to get it when I'm already in there. I can just send a quick text as the attorney and maybe that'll give the client a little bit more, you know, peace of mind. But it's good. Obviously things fall and get missed but that's why we're doing file reviews. don't think it's an optional task for the attorneys. I think Did we mandatory for everybody to do it? Because these are our cases at the end of the day. I personally like just a piece of mind knowing what's going on with each case.
00:17:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And do you feel like you have a better hold on your job and your team since looking at it that way?
00:17:24 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Looking at it, how?
00:17:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see, looking at all the cases with that kind of frequency, looking at it with a list you've come up with knowing that these are all the things that have to happen, and then looking at the timeline of these things happening. So if I understand correctly, the pace for both of you have improved, and that level of detail didn't exist to the way that it does at the moment, even a couple of months ago. Am I right about that?
00:18:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I'm sure more so for me because the more experience you get, the quicker you are knowing what needs to be done at a certain stage.
00:18:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the question is, how do you feel like do you feel like you have a better understanding and grasp of your team, which is basically a business within a business, business? Do you feel like that's improving because of the way that you are forerenzically looking at everything?
00:18:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
If I just think, let's say I didn't do any file reviews, it would probably be a nightmare on these cases because if no one's poking and saying, hey, what's going on with this is likely just going to keep going the way it is, if there hasn't been contact for three months, it's likely going to go on for five months, six months. So, yeah, I think now that, I mean, the team knows, like, I mess up. to lc daily cases hey where's this where's that so they know that it's being monitored i think that's another um kind of like way to remind them to do what they're supposed to do because eventually i'm going to go look and ask them hey what happened here um because you know when i started to mark a screen in my cases that's kind of how he would do it to me so um i was like well let me make sure like knowing somebody's looking over here it's older huh yeah i mean it's for the better right i mean these are all our cases and you know i'm not going to sit here and just delegate tasks and not do anything like so negotiate so well especially not if you want to be topped up right yeah like can't like give up control like i still write my own demands there's a difference between delegation and abdication that's the to you if you fail
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's still on me. I'm coming for you Education so application is I'm giving you all the power and It happens in business all the time. So for like in the world that I have a lot of times I'm working with very small companies. They work from home. They've been multi-million dollar A big deal but marketing is the life and blood of the business if there are no customers. There is no business So it doesn't matter how great your fulfillment is it doesn't matter how great your team is it doesn't matter how great your product is If nobody's buying there is no business if everybody's buying and you suck at fulfillment They're still some business. So What will happen though is a person, you know who's been just exhausted with having to do it all for so long hire some and they're like, oh, you're smart, just do it. Like, I'm throwing money at you, lots and lots of money, do a good job, that's not how that works. Money is not generally enough of a motivator for most people to do excellence. comes intrinsically, it comes internally, it comes from something that drives a person. The person who is driven to excellence will be driven to excellence, even if there's no external reward. That's the thing about intrinsic motivation. They're driven by something inside of them that requires them to show up and be the best they can. They're competing, even if there's no prize for competing and just knowing that they're the best, that intrinsic motivation keeps them going. You know what I'm saying? So when we have teams that we manage, getting somebody to do the job in order to help us reach the goal. whether it's a team goal or the internal goal, but generally it's gonna be an alignment of both, right? You have your own drive. It's probably not everybody else's goal to the level that it is yours to be top part in the company. They might be like, yeah, that sounds cool, but they're probably not thinking about it as much as you're thinking about it. They're probably not hungry for it the way that you're hungry for it, right? get a paycheck, I'm not the attorney. So to give somebody a task and expect them to be thinking about it and prioritize it and organize and structure their day and to be disciplined about it to the level that you would doesn't make any sense. And so you wanna make sure that you don't abdicate, give them full responsibility and ownership over everything. You hope that they will rise to the occasion and you hope that they will want that as much as you do but the reason. ideas people generally don't show up like that. So you do have to always keep your eye on all the things all the time. You are going to be the leader. There will be one leader. Now there can be co-leaders, right? But at the end of the day, only one person is accountable for all things. That will be you, each of you. So looking at that and being able to break it down, Lorenz, how do you feel like your just kind of grasp of things, the traction, how the team is behaving, like just what are what's the thing that you might have observed as we've been going into this? going to keep using the word forensically more because it's, you see, I think of forensics, think of looking at the like the anatomy, what's the makeup, like, what do you call it though? Magnifying the last like really Inspecting every detail rather than you know 30,000 foot view to like microscopic view, right? Um, that's how we've been really digging into stuff. How do you feel like that is having an impact? Um, mentoring day to day operations all that.
00:24:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, uh, You know, I'm the kind of person that's never happy. Uh, I always want more.
00:24:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Never happy or never satisfied.
00:24:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
They're too very different. Never, never satisfied. I always, I always want more, always demand more of myself and my team. But, and so I have to kind of force myself to look at the 10,000 foot view and see which direction we're going. You know, we are going upward. momentum is upward and forwards. And so that's, I like to see that. I like to see that there's improvements every week. It's not, we're not leveling out, we're not plateauing. But yeah, of course I want to speed things up. I want to do more. I want bigger settlements. want to go from 20 demands a month to 40 demands a month. I want to, I want all my clients to, I want to figure out a way for all my clients to do their recommended injections, because that's what's going to help them feel better and get better settlement numbers for them. So I'm always, I'm always looking, I can't, when my wife and I sit down to watch TV at night, I have my laptop on my lap, trying to figure out new solutions and new ways to look at things. So, I don't You got some competitor in you, I see, I see you. I don't really worry about.
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What other people are doing because I can't control that but yeah, that's I mean really that's the only competitor you actually have cuz You're the only person that is made with the same skills and the same stuff like Improving and beating your best is I mean like I said, it's it's the only true like experiment Because everything if you're looking at a scientific method right then you isolate the variables that means only one variable is Only one thing is actually variable everything else is fixed So but when you're competing against else there's infinite variables you you can't there's nothing else. So You would be That's anyway, that's it. I gotta capture this real quick. So you need to Need to remember that this report is wrong. It's not gonna work is it? Hold on The average resolution speed by team Is that that? Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm an integration, capture, you can see it. There we go. Because I'm looking at this again and it's weird because it has average resolution speed is less than Yeah, that doesn't make any sense. For your team, your average days to close is higher than your average days to resolution, but for everyone else, go away. The average day to close is higher. And wait a you see this? So, like, we were looking at this before. Whatever this is, be the same ratio for everyone, this number, or is it? It is higher. Hold on. There's 64. Okay. Okay. This is the right thing. So, this is total close, and this is resolved. So, this is probably paid, and this is, we came to. It got settled. Resolution's probably settled. All right. That proportion is correct. That's interesting. This disparity is pretty big. It's not a month roughly, not quite a month, but then. The speed to act. actually closed. Now it's only really a week difference. Anyway, these are the targets. So this is last 90 days. Let's do the first quarter. Or for the gimme, let's see, equals last quarter is roughly the last 90 days. I don't want that. We'll just do this here. I feel like that number was higher, so, too many one. All right, Lorenz, keep track of your number and Sam's number, 319, 291, Patrick, keep track of your number. Even though we know that that's skewed and Tyler's number 301. So I'm gonna switch it back to 90 days real quick It's got it Yeah That's weird I would not expect that to go up, but it did for everybody I think In the last 90 days, I wonder how that report pulls data Hmm any thoughts guys Maybe like increasing cases Yeah, that's a significant jump though, so for Lorenz it was 346 versus what? three twenty three nineteen three nineteen so twenty seven days so less than a month but still that's a month and then Samantha's number change to you remember what her the number one I feel like it was like 200 something yeah hers was like two ninety something okay and then Tyler let's go switch that back again one more time and it was this year so let's everything up till now so three nineteen yep and then hers was two ninety one so she's roughly 20 day difference higher which is about what yours is right friends yeah and then Tyler's what was Tyler's is he's went down No, that should probably do. It's just an easy, different window side by side. Real one, watch out, 281. Okay, yeah, so here's one up. Here's one. Oh yeah, he did the opposite. So this actually went down. This is 90 days. Well, and where's the volume?
00:32:25 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Although I don't think that would be such a bad thing because it's across the board, we're all getting clients to get more procedures than they normally would have before. It will naturally extend the time it takes to resolve.
00:32:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is definitely true. Do you feel like that's happening?
00:32:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
It is for my team. I remember getting like two injections was like, were aired for my case book, but now like happens very frequently.
00:32:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How about you, Lorenz? Is that happening for you?
00:33:01 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I'm getting good value out of my cases higher higher policy limits the Still struggling with my Hispanic clients, but actually I've been digging down with with Mike and Karen who's kind of a newcomer to the team and We're we parents been able to cases that are in negotiations right now She's been able to convince the clients to go back and do the injection so it can get more value out of the cases Yeah, we've had it for 10 days and she's already been able to change three clients minds a I'm wondering if Jessica just just because he's a little bit more shy and I'm not it's not the right word, but like she's not very like assertive when she's talking to clients. I wonder if she's not able to kind of like make them see the light, make them see that this is in their best interest.
00:34:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So and that comes down to training in the same way that it's adjacent anyway to the same kind of conversation you had with Viri helping her to feel more confident and open up to you.
00:34:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's just kind of interesting because Jessica used to be kind of the superstar on the team. She used to be like the the CM where you know she just runs with it and now I'm like okay I think we have to do a little bit a little bit of retraining because it's kind of throwing me off a little bit and management.
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is so important, because again, human resources, things happen. People can go through traumatic experiences that can shake them. They could just have a really bad experience with a call. They can become apathetic. There's multiple reasons why somebody would pull back professionally or professionally in certain arenas. And so these are things that you want to try to discover in your monthly meetings with your team. You're one on one, right, where you can dig a little bit deeper. But also you always want to be paying attention to what people are talking about. You want to be paying attention to their tone and to their body language and be aware of what kind of day you're having. Mark, when we're on our calls, it's almost never on video. I can tell instantly what kind of day he's having, by the way that he says hello. Not everybody is going to pick up all those things. That is a particular skill set. But just being intentional about watching and observing how your team is doing is going to be helpful and impactful. The other thing is training, but knowing that you're watching things, knowing that you're measuring things, all of these things have an impact on how people perform as well as things that are happening in their outside lives, you know, at home and other things that they're going through. So even though traumatic things can happen, difficult things can happen, sometimes even mental disorders and struggles, just anxiety. to me, it's odd to call that disorder because that's just life for the majority of people. And whether or not debilitating, still can feel like disability. and disorder, you know, makes it seem like it's a disability, whereas reduced is all it takes to create a quality of life issue and a satisfaction issue and stress and not being able to sleep, which then has a compounding effect of all the problems because we're not sleeping good. It's so easy for like everything is related, you know, so as you're observing these things and looking at who's doing what and how and you might notice in this contrast that this person used to do better, used to do worse, whatever, you just want to address that as as a leader, as a manager, but more specifically as a leader, managers, know, manage, leaving is a whole different kind of thing. It's being interested in in the person and caring about the outcome for the company, but also for the person. anyway, I would love every week if you guys are noticing things, you know, about about your teams, about performance, bring that stuff so you can kind of brainstorm about it. what now that you have this awareness, Lorenz, what is your timeline? is your plan for doing something about what you've observed?
00:38:26 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, well, I've got a couple of things cooking. Number one, Jessica was she was preparing and playing her own wedding for the last couple of months. And so she just got back, she took two weeks to go on her honeymoon and she just got back yesterday. So I'm gonna, you know, kind of meet with her probably at the end of the week to kind of see how she's done, how she's doing. The second thing is, I'm gonna be, as soon as John is going on a paternity leave, well, any day now, whenever the baby comes. And so that's gonna be for two weeks, so she's gonna be subbing in for John as a CM. when John comes back, I'm gonna put her back in with Jessica. Heron is a very experienced CM. She did nine errors at Sweet James. And she knows her stuff really, really well. And so she can help, she already helped. She helped me go through Jessica's cases and kind of bring them up to date. And she's gonna help Jessica shoulder some of the load and get her back on track if there's any burnout or anything like that. Trying to get her, you know, I think it's... If there is burnout, if this is a burnout situation, it might be good to like give her a little bit more, give her some confidence by offering some help from an experienced CM who can shoulder some of that load that she might feel overwhelmed by.
00:40:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that awareness. So I have lots of different thoughts about that. The first thing I'll say is that it's important to be aware when somebody shifts into a box ticking scenario, okay? Box ticking is, I did it, right? It's not how good I did it, how well I did it, it's just I did it. So somebody went through a divorce on the team and was definitely not showing up for a while and the numbers were showing on that team for a while and then all of a sudden that person noticed the dip in the paycheck and they're like, I got to fix this. There are different things that people can be aware of when they're going through stuff. So again, human resources, some of it has to be tolerated, but not without effort. So you can know that you're going to give somebody space for what they're going through in their life, but that doesn't mean that you don't call them up to be aware of the fact that they're not operating at the same level. So one of the things that you can do is be like, when you're here, I need you to be here. That doesn't mean you're not still giving them space for the fact that they may not be able to be fully there. So it's almost that you're doing two things that are at odds with each other. It's not. It's that you're doing your best. to pull them up in the middle of what they're going through, but knowing that it's a request, it's not a demand and a punishment. So the approach is what makes the difference. So sometimes we simply just need to be conscious of the fact that we're not being present and be told that we need to be present. Sometimes really that's all it takes. You'd be like, Jessica, you know, we really should be pushing for this. You used to do that, you're not doing it. I know that you're getting married. know your best stuff in your mind. While you're on these types of phone calls, can you try to be conscious of not taking the box and just being like, I had this call, but make that call be what it's supposed to be. And knowing that that phone call is actually the outcome of the case and how much we get paid, which is the whole purpose of this business, but also it's your job. for that person to make sure that they're getting the best care and the most care that they need to because once the case is closed even if they have any residual issues they're probably not getting taken care of and now it's out of pocket so you have duty to that person sometimes just helping people be aware like hey we're slipping a little bit I know you got stuff going on but I need you to try to do better that's different than you're slipping fix it or else you know what I mean you're still giving them space for being human and also saying do be conscious and try so just keep that tuck that under your hat the other thing is burnout okay so once you get to burnout burnout can be very difficult to recover from it's different for everybody so the first thing that you try to do is proactively avoid it one of those things is really about how we spend our time during the day. I think I talked to you guys about energy services, right? Right, doing the hard things, doing the good thing, doing the good things, hard things, the good things, right? So that's one of the things to being able to talk to people about how they manage their energy and making sure that your team members are energy conscious, right? Because so many of us have, we have people in our lives that are energy vampires, we have things in our lives that are energy vampires, they just drain us, right? But if we're on autopilot, which when people are stressed out and overwhelmed, autopilot kind of kicks in, there's actually a psychological term for it. And it's like called default, default system, I can't remember what it's called Lawrence, you started study psychology, didn't you?
00:44:55 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, like 20 years ago.
00:45:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is the auto-pilot machine psychology, automatic processing? Yeah, automatic processing. rushing a T-thread. it's like, have you ever just, like, faded out and you're like, I don't even know what just happened over the last five minutes because you were zoning out, but you actually were doing something, you can be driving. That's called automatic processing, what most of us would refer to as auto-pilot. It can happen. A person can be on a call talking to a client and be in the automatic processing mode because they're not being conscious about what they're doing. So, when they're overwhelmed and stressed, that is what happened. It's kind of a defense mechanism also to deal with stress and anxiety and overwhelm. But it also happens when we're doing things monotonously. So, if you are not, this comes back to the motivation and the entrance. motivation. If when you show up, you're like, I got things to accomplish. I'm not just taking boxes, but like, I'm trying to be top dog around here. I'm trying to not get fired. I'm trying to not be stressed out. I'm trying to whatever it is, right? There's something driving you that is important that you're thinking about, not just like, this is the next task I got to do. Okay, did that? You know what I mean? So you'll be able to observe that you may go through those things. I'm sure you do. We all do it at some point. And your people will go through it. But just because it's the inclination doesn't need to mean that it's what actually is allowed to happen. So like, so I noticed, it kind of feels like you're taking boxes. And I know you're going through up but can we try to do better? Here is how you could do better. Don't have somebody to do better who's stressed out and overwhelmed and not give them a way to do it because if they're stressed out and overwhelmed, the mental load is what's overwhelming them as much as the physical load. So if you're asking them to try to figure out how to fix things when they're like, I'm mush, planning a wedding, going through divorce, somebody in the family being in a wreck, your brain shuts down and so even the thing that you used to be able to do on autopilot can be difficult. Your job as a leader first of all is to manage your energy the best that you can to manage your your mentality the best that you can and then to check your people and look at them and like how are they doing? How do they feel? Like what's their mood? Like get a read on them, look at their stuff. Are they On autopilot are they taking boxes or they is something meaningful to them? You know I'm saying That makes sense you guys so That is kind of that that is that is the reward of going through everything Forensics is your level of awareness becomes greater. So imagine that You're going into class for the first time and you remember those like times Like multiplication test that you would get they give you a sheet of all these different multiplication things And you and they were timed and you had to get as many down as you could before the time was up you guys both had that experience Okay At the beginning of the year and the end of the year what was the difference between those?
00:48:52 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
All right speed speed but also stress, right?

Like, the first time you looked at that, palm sweating, mom spaghetti.
00:49:05 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Just kidding.
00:49:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, they're exciting.
00:49:09 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
It's like a challenge.
00:49:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. anxiety. Like, holy crap. Okay. So what's the difference at the end is experience, but it's also awareness, because what you went through that year was you learned the times tables. You learned one through 10, 11, 12, probably, and you memorize them so that the mental load was diminished because it was wrote practice. You did it on repeat so much that you didn't have to think about it. You just knew what to do. But you were thinking about it every time you went to class, you were practicing it, and you were thinking about it so much that it just became easy. So what you're doing right now is you're basically learning the times tables of your business. right? You came into it and you're looking at it and there's this overwhelm and like I got all the stuff to do. How am I going to get it done? Well, stress, anxiety, and then the end of the year is going to come where you've been like looking at one through one times two, two times three, nine times nine, eleven times eleven, all these things show up and you're like, well, I know how to solve that. I know how to make that better. I know that's going wrong. I know who's dropping the ball there. I know how to fix the fact that they're dropping the ball there. Your level of awareness has just increased exponentially. So your ability to get the work done, the same exact work at the beginning of the year versus the end of the year, right? A sheet full of all these multiplication problems and you're going to get through the end of the year and be like, I got this. My team's got this. That's what we're doing right now. So, but it doesn't happen overnight. You know, some people did really well with maybe the twos and the fours, but not so good with the sevens, right? There will be those aspects in your business, where you're like, okay, I got intro calls, but I've got distributions, where are my sevens? You know what I mean? Like, there's different aspects, your teammates are going to have different things over different types of things. But because you're looking at it, top to bottom, left to right,,000 foot, you down to the microscopic view, and because you're taking accountability and ownership and leadership, not just over the results of the business and the company, but over your people, you guys are going to get some amazing results, but you have to, once you get that awareness, you have to go solve the problem. So if you see somebody slipping, whether it be yourself or somebody else, You have to address it, and you have to teach the solution. Don't just go say fix this, do better. Let me give you some ideas and suggestions about how you could do it better. also before you even do that, ask questions. Anything going on that I'm not aware of? Because I noticed this, and I think that you're this kind of quality person. And you've had this kind of quality work, but you work. Right now it was not up to what I know you can do or have done in the past. first of all, what's going on? Is there anything you want to talk about? Anything I can help you with? And whether they do or not, at the end of the day regardless, we still have to do better because this business requires it. This is what the job is, and the job is a privilege. It is not an entitled thing, right? to earn the job to get it. You got to earn the job to keep it. So here's how you could do this and always put an emphasis on this probably be the process that will take the least amount of mental effort. Like always look for the optimized version of how they can do better without being so stressed out. So that's where our automations and workflow come in. That's where the checklist comes in and really like hey if you are struggling to even figure out like what should I be doing today which by the way guys know I was talking about earlier a quick and dirty version until we get to the automations workflow. I cannot think of a better solution. Feel free to tell me if you have better idea. But I think just a spreadsheet where we have so let me go through this real quick and it would be a big old spreadsheet and it could take a long time to go through so I don't know that maybe it's one sheet, maybe it's multiple sheets and you go by the status that the case is in, right, like the first I feel like it's roughly three months months where there's like the most of the flurry and then there's you know they're going through treatment and so we're not closed yet and then there's closed end to resolution where we're waiting for the payment. So maybe we have a tab for or open and active and then we have a tab for in treatment and then we have a tab for close but not settled or wait settled but not closed but what I think would be awesome is if we had a spreadsheet for each of you and here's all the things right and instead of who does this there's a checkbox or a status of like whether it's being done now I know you have litify and you can go through all of that here's the difference and so like I'll give you example and litify I've got reports and one of the ports gives me all the data that I want, but the way that it's laid out is linear and I can't wrap my head around the 30,000 foot view, which is what I really, really need. And so we put that into bar charts, graphs, pie charts, things like that, and in charts, so I can see what I need to see. The information is there, but if I can't mentally process it because of the way that it's laid out, if I can't process it like this, if I have to look at it, every time I have to look at it, I have to do some calculations. It's not laid out in the best way possible. So all of this is already laid out and litified. But if you can't go, scatter it and be like, very quickly, this was the last day that was touched, and this is the phase that it's in, and that lines up with what I know it should be, which you cannot do and let it by right now very well, I think. Do you think I'm wrong? Do you think you can do this and let it by well? you guys do it day to day so I sort them by category okay the case status I feel like yeah I think you can actually because I don't want to create more work but what I want to make sure that we're doing is really being able to as quickly as possible and and I feel like being able to just look at it room across the board like on track off track kind of thing which also that's something that I want to identify people about it with the workflow automations on track off track if we can have a red toggle button or green toggle button like you know Excel has conditional formatting where like if a number falls between a certain amount it'll turn red like it's a negative number You know what I'm talking about Lawrence? Okay, so like, what if let if I had this condition to where basically, let's say the last comment was longer than a week ago, red flag. So all you're doing now is looking for red or a particular status. That would be really helpful too. I want to make sure I make a note for myself to talk to a little bit about that, to see if we can have an on track, off track, on on pace, off pace, and maybe what would be cool too is if each of these could be a sub status. What do you guys think about that? Would that be helpful? But I don't know if it would be because some of them are overlapped. So maybe we punk them into groups, the ones that overlap. This. is where this kind of thinking guys is where we create the system that doesn't create more work. So really thinking about what that structure could look like, where it doesn't create more work. That takes a lot of mental effort, but it will save it in the end and it will keep us from overwhelming everybody while we're trying to figure out the system. The other thing that I'm working with, founders and CEOs. quite often we have seven and even eight bigger businesses with teams of just five. If somebody, this is phrase and one of my mentors gave me was like, happens if you get hit by a bus tomorrow? I'm like, that's terrible. I just got a shock at myself. Just even thinking about that. But when you think about the impact to the business, it's significant. For now, imagine it's you, like something happens to you and you are unable to do your job for weeks at a time, for some reason, um, you're going to have if you're conscious, you're going to have anxiety be able about what's happening. If your system is so tight that another attorney can come in and if you guys are following a relatively similar system, another attorney and your case managers, and honestly for the most part, the case managers and the assistant should be able to do pretty much everything. The biggest issue is that attorneys have liability and so you you perform at a higher level. We've had this conversation before, right? You are liable to the state, to the government for the actions that happen. Your case managers legally and your assistant legally are not liable for anything that happens in the case. have to like actually break a law. But you in terms of like just obeying the law and being compliant, you have liability. So anyway, not everybody can do everything, but for the most part, because you're pre-lit, most of this can be done by anybody else. So let's say one of you gets hit by a bus or one of your team members get hit by a bus. If running this system is so well documented and organized, and you can see where everything is at, at all times, and you know where it's at, and also you're following the same type of system to know where everything's at. God forbid anything bad happens to somebody, but life happens. Somebody else would be able to step in and go like, I know exactly where we're at, and we can all handle it. Imagine the piece that will give the person who's not able to work for a while, as well as everybody that has to work. Now nobody wants to think in such morbid terms, but... it's reality as things happen. I mean, we went through a pandemic, the whole world shut down and changed the way that it operated. This type of structure, anything that was structured like this was barely phased. So keep that in mind, we're over time, and I yacked your ears off already, you're probably like bleeding on the inside, like, okay, already, Tina, the same as alone, but whatever. I ain't apologize. I appreciate you, Tina. I love you, quiet guys. You don't have to be so quiet, but keep working on it. Keep thinking about it and bring your ideas. I don't really have any ways how you could use these processes and Or if you look at it and go, know, it would be great if I could do this, but I don't know how I could do that. Because I am going to, we are going to have that meeting. I would love to take your feature requests or functionality requests. So maybe it does exist and we just don't know how to use it to that conversation. And please be thinking about how we can use the tools that we have to go from, if we could zoom in and out from 30,000 foot view to the microscopic view, you would have a full understanding of everything all the time and the more that you understand it, the better you can manage it. And also the better that you can teach your people to use it, right? So just be thinking about what kind of structure and functions in your tools would help you to manage it more efficiently. and help your team to manage it more efficiently and bring any ideas to the table. Other than that, just keep doing the best you can and think about the kind of leader that you want to be and notice your people and take good care of them.

that's okay interesting how people are deciding just yeah it's okay it's legal so the guy wasn't close to the kid so you shouldn't get anything it's like or last year that we've been talking do you feel like that could have come up at any point yeah normal stuff I can handle just yeah so are you able to practice law in Oregon no okay just checking because if and when you ever are then I can return referrals hopefully I mean I don't really want to hope that I know somebody in an accident but Smith applied to wave into it it's just easier for her to do that so I'll just wait on that yeah any that we had started something actually we go open my notes I just met Do you love him?
00:01:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So much. Yeah. Uh, yes. The fact that he's like, do you want to meet her? I was like, yes. And she's just, yeah. Yeah. I've been smiling the whole time.
00:01:17 - mark sweet
You're the best. They're great people. So, and you're going help them a lot because they're really smart people, they also are really good at following directions.
00:01:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's great. And also, food use, like, I'm really good at telling people, uh, doctored truth, meaning, like, if he was asked about whether he hit his goals or not, like, you know, dancing around the truth, basically, to make it look like he did.
00:01:45 - mark sweet
Got it.
00:01:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So anyway, I'm excited about it. Barely scratched the surface. The beginning always takes so long, they get to know each other and know what's going on with that's good. Okay. So. Wait, are you giving me the weekly? What you call it? Where are they at? was looking at valiant valiant was showing up good. Yeah, they were better at the beginning of the month and towards the end I mean, that's kind of like helpful cousin that normally will the last several months even really slow in the beginning And so that kind of helps off stuff it. Hold on. Let me get these Hello, Dan I'm like five meetings deep and like so This is like I'm sweating from so many meetings. Okay, I'm not even moving I'm like good. Great. let's let's talk about leads and anything down related and then we can let you go.
00:02:55 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
How's that? Oh, no, no, it's I'm in meeting mode.
00:02:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let's rock and roll This is why they're on Mondays. Yes, this is true. Okay, well, let's do that anyway. Oh, I'm at my desk. I'm getting the little pie and actually see things the right way.
00:03:12 - mark sweet
You know, good way to get a negative review removed. I'm So can Washington people and we have an client who will respond and his only phone number is a business that they have to go find him.
00:03:30 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
don't really. You asked people to go. Does he say anything mean or.
00:03:36 - mark sweet
It's just one star. So it looks really bad. And there's only one review. So I'm asking teams to get people to leave reviews to kind of water it down. Well, my problem is what he says is factually inaccurate, but the attorney client privilege doesn't allow me to respond in a way that would make sense.
00:03:59 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, you got to get. You got to get people to go, like, so if you're logged in, like, I can go right now and say, like, remove this review because it's harassment and bullying, right? So, and they'll remove it.
00:04:16 - mark sweet
Okay. likely to see it removed.
00:04:20 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I'll do right now.
00:04:22 - mark sweet
Thank you.
00:04:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, why I don't know if I should just dive right into this. Yeah, let's, let's talk about other things first. Where the heck are my notes? Okay. Um, valiant. Any ability to talk to him and find out what's he doing?
00:04:44 - mark sweet
Yeah, we're trying to set a time. He just puts you with the two kids.
00:04:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:04:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay, um, what is the blue steel?
00:05:15 - mark sweet
That's quantified. That's what we got from each unit. But that can't scale, unfortunately. So they added a little bit more volume, but not much.
00:05:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We asked that questions more until I just memorize it. That's it. Is it me or is phobe picking up a little?
00:05:45 - mark sweet
No, they're picking up a little bit because I got on their pretty hard. And then we took money away from Washington. So that might be part of reason why we've been more than money in other areas.
00:06:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You and Missouri, you gave me that.
00:06:12 - mark sweet
The two Missouri cases.
00:06:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:06:20 - mark sweet
One, I think was Walker, I'm just going to share.
00:06:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay.
00:06:35 - mark sweet
Yeah, one was Walker, the other one was.
00:06:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, here, Missouri. Wait a minute. Reports and takes my source. I see Missouri six Walker for. What is this period in June?
00:07:00 - mark sweet
Both the walker cases.
00:07:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Um, so this is intake, not retainers. Okay. So hold on a second. Do I have retainers by source by state matters. That's it. Matters by state. Source status. New Mexico. Okay. Okay. me use screen. Go through this stuff. Share screen. Okay.
00:07:39 - mark sweet
Teaming tiny bit off. That's why I also send the email because there's. Or. Now it's not a one. That's still where they signed it, but hasn't been converted yet. Okay. So there's always like a little bit of a lot of.
00:07:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I, because I was just thinking about that, like how, you know, and. terms of like reporting for the Monday meeting because we have this dashboard to dig in when a question arises but it's still not the succinct summary that you give us and also the thing that I like about that is I know that you've gone in and you've looked at it and kind of, you know, taking it in like this is where we're at with it. So we've got the intakes by source and state, matters by source and state. So if I click on Missouri, oh, wait, that's not what it just did. That is so weird. There were six and it said, maybe I just, maybe I clicked on, okay, that's what I did. I clicked on the Mexico. Never mind. Okay, so it's not crazy. Okay, so this works good. Oh, and I can, hold on just right clicking or just clicking on it and hovering it. this. Tell me Walker. All right, so the report is working well that way and takes by source and state and takes by source and state. Why do we have this twice?
00:09:14 - mark sweet
The left looks like it's more like source. And one of them right looks like it's just flipped by a state. Do you know what mean?
00:09:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, yeah, Okay, state, case source. Okay, so it's just a different view. So that's good. That's still helpful and takes status. So one thing I was looking at though is this intake turned down a source by reason. We were trying to get rid of other, but for the month of June already, and I actually don't know how many intakes there were, but there were 60 others turned on details. Government case only wanted to file these reports spam. Spam should not be others.
00:09:56 - mark sweet
Spam should be spam.
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, it definitely should be its own turn down reason. Um, referral.
00:10:07 - mark sweet
So those are the protected.
00:10:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, what?
00:10:12 - mark sweet
No one wanted it.
00:10:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, like your team didn't want it.
00:10:19 - mark sweet
We didn't want it. Jeff didn't want it.
00:10:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:10:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that, okay. Okay. Um, so we do we want to make that no one wants this case? Do we feel like 60 other is okay or should we be doing this a little bit?
00:10:39 - mark sweet
mean, there are, it's actually pretty small percentage.
00:10:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I'm asking. Yeah, because I don't, I don't really know. I said go F yourself. yeah.
00:10:52 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:10:54 - mark sweet
You might want to add a text at the stop because that one is from the wall.
00:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, who does that?
00:11:03 - mark sweet
Who, like? Can you add it? And then we'll just make sure that Patsy knows. And then teaches the staff, then re-teaches the staff like two weeks. Don't forget.
00:11:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So what I'm asking though is how do we make that an action item that gets done? Right now. Okay. So let me go. Okay. Okay. So we're going to. Create a turned on reason.
00:11:32 - mark sweet
PC texted to stop and. I'm just going to text it. Because I don't want to be too long.
00:11:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um.
00:11:51 - mark sweet
There's a good example of other. Which one?
00:11:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll just go through. Okay. Okay. I'm Down more.
00:12:06 - mark sweet
So there you go. Uh, not an accident when it was a small clean shipper, but you want to pull your out.
00:12:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, this one, not a car accident. Oh, there needed a sense.
00:12:24 - mark sweet
That's a good.
00:12:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, so. Okay, fake lead, fake lead. Twice, but thinking in terms of. What do we want to track? What do we need to track? What's important to track, especially in terms of vendors. Duplicates and fake leads.
00:12:51 - mark sweet
So those usually get sent back because there's bad phone, so they should be using bad phone. And there's a spam sales. And there's a wrong location.
00:13:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In terms of turn down reason. So are some of these should have been marked differently? Yep. Okay. So that's a coaching issue.
00:13:23 - mark sweet
Yep.
00:13:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And will you be coaching them?
00:13:29 - mark sweet
Yep.
00:13:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is this what we're here for Mark? Yep. Happy Monday. Okay. Let's see. Go back. Oh, there we go. Okay. So. We were looking at adding. Other things to this report. I'm probably done here and I'll go back to my notes and see the status of that Josh was busy or something Dan He turned a bunch of stuff in there.
00:14:12 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I asked Mark. I don't know if you were on there. I asked Mark on the close date thing So Stacy is sending Josh Mark's response and we'll let us know resolution date. He definitely didn't Think that was he definitely didn't consider that one. I know that So if resolution date works, then he'll swap it out with he created closed date So he'll just price swap that out in the Automation that he made and then he'll use that for that report. So then That part will be done and then Stacy literally just texted me that He just emailed her and he's gonna forward me the email. He's working Mark, you're doing a new dashboard. right. I have to read this. really long. I'll let you guys know. A lot of questions.
00:15:20 - mark sweet
was like, not right now.
00:15:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Too many questions. Yeah. was like, for right now.
00:15:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a. report. It says recent records.
00:15:30 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Dad. D D matters.
00:15:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's it.
00:15:33 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That's it.
00:15:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's it.
00:15:34 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
it. It is.
00:15:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's I think D and D company. So yeah. I know. But what's funny is one says dad. D D matters. one says Dan. D D matters.
00:15:46 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I don't know. Yeah.
00:15:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
As of June 24th. So they if I'm and takes by date. The. Let So. We'll be here at eilies again. Okay. Okay. Okay, so wait, just so you can see this, S4s, DAD, DD matters and DD intake. So we're looking at the intake one, converted intakes by dates, and a record count equals last month. Okay, record count eight, but that can't be right because converted would be retained, right?
00:16:38 - mark sweet
Converted or retained, but unless they're a drop for some of them, right?
00:16:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And we didn't get 844 retainers in May.
00:16:48 - mark sweet
And that would be sweet.
00:16:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. No, it would not.
00:16:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That would just come.
00:16:54 - mark sweet
Go back up. Or that's the intake. number. That's gotta be the intake number.
00:17:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because the conversion rate is 0.1%, but there's no number for it.
00:17:07 - mark sweet
I totally believe we got 840 like actual leads.
00:17:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the issue is that this isn't labeled correctly for one, two, the conversion rate, there's no number. So that's not really helpful, but now let's go down a little bit, convert it intake by state. There's no, let's see, number, record count 644, so that would have to be leads. And yeah, so this is not, okay, percentage. We're getting there, but this is not good by itself. It's not labeled correctly leads versus like intake leads versus retainers. That's those are the labels we need. And there needs to actually be numbers for the retainers. Yeah, so. If you can just get back with them on that degree. And let's look at the other one just in case it was a different report. Dad, did he met her? Oh, whoa. Case is closed. Close date. We'll go last month. Oh, it was already refreshing. Oh, nice. Two learns. Team Patrick. Oh, it's team Sam, like the smallest one. Oh, because it's cute. This is closed, not just, that'll be interesting to watch this.
00:19:06 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I don't think that one's right, though, because that's the one that I just sent them, but he used, he used something, same principle. We're like, Oh, tweet this, tweet them.
00:19:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Okay.
00:19:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah, there you go.
00:19:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. This is going to be fun to start with that.
00:19:26 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
big boy dashboards now.
00:19:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dropouts and subs by team, average fee by team. It's your litigator, right? No, no, no, there's the newbie. Oh, yeah, in Arizona. Well, how many cases has he had, though, and has he done them on his own?
00:19:49 - mark sweet
He started to do the more in his own, but he has a lot of my cases.
00:19:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So they were just big by because they were yours. Yeah. Okay. So this is interesting. Any thoughts about this at all in terms of accuracy in terms of questions like just what do you think when you see this?
00:20:17 - mark sweet
This is just this one.
00:20:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, this is me. You want to see it. Let's see it for the year. Yeah, equals this year. I like that.
00:20:30 - mark sweet
Automatically read questions. Yes, looks like I want to do it.
00:20:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. The snapshot snook a big difference. Thank God.
00:20:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Look at teamwork is amazing.
00:20:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know, right? That dude is crushing by 10 cases. Yeah. Man, Sam just ahead of the pack on cases closed by team. Like across the board. or more dropped out and subbed out, but she's also taking really frustrating. I would like to see this as a percentage, though, rather than a number, because that is more important.
00:21:14 - mark sweet
You know, about is worse than drop. usually means there's more of an intake issue.
00:21:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so this one, what was it called?
00:21:26 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
DD? Drop means they left you, right? No, subbed means they left you.
00:21:31 - mark sweet
No, drop means we drop the case.
00:21:34 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Subbed means they fired us. Right. And you drop it because of an intake issue, meaning it was a bad intake, that you shouldn't ever take it in the first place.
00:21:44 - mark sweet
Probably clients sometimes lies to us. find out there's no insurance.
00:21:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
We just don't treat it all.
00:21:51 - mark sweet
So it's usually why we end up dropping it. Subbed is we didn't like you.
00:21:58 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
found a new attorney.
00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
yeah so dropped out's okay set that is bad i mean dropped is kind of no fault for the most part yeah yeah just most of these so 12 for the year for samantha five for the year for the rans five for the year for tyler but can we find on this same report how many retainers they took so if we can't find it in this report i know we can in the next one so let me go the little fly now just go back to the dd dan intake um let's see oh this isn't one by attorneys that's my state so um cases closed by team and talk about how many they took though gross archery Effective 40% by case type, what is that? How many percent on this thing? Although I don't we don't really use case type, so I don't So this was what we're trying to get at the percentage of like max policy limit.
00:23:28 - mark sweet
The average shoot by case type, what types of cases are the best ones for us to take?
00:23:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, this is awesome. But one of the things that we did want to do was try to see policy limits, and I was wondering if that was what this is supposed to be.
00:23:47 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That's gotta be it.
00:23:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we need, okay, that's by case type, but we need it by attorney. Effective by source, effective by source, gross attorney fee by source, average by state, like effective percentage by team. So, yeah, over the year, I don't know how many they took. So, okay. Also, don't it. don't like. It's 1% effective. We need clearer labels. I'm going to get some total cases of total matters.
00:25:05 - mark sweet
started to get into it.
00:25:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It does looks like something went wrong.
00:25:09 - mark sweet
Then you'll put your request as your sales for admin for help.
00:25:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Huh?
00:25:13 - mark sweet
So when I go into the effect of 40% and just click on it.
00:25:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Any of it.
00:25:21 - mark sweet
Okay. Yeah. I can't really put something wrong.
00:25:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got that. Maybe. This report. Click on it that way.
00:25:40 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Nope.
00:25:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was just 10.
00:25:42 - mark sweet
So maybe I don't have permission for it or something.
00:25:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, that would be weird. But could be possible.
00:25:51 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. These are definitely not released in the wild.
00:25:55 - mark sweet
You just send them to me. Yeah.
00:25:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, but this is his letify account.
00:26:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
He should have access. to everything. And Josh is getting paid so he doesn't want the client to see how it works. now you've ruined that team. This poor guy.
00:26:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
probably years of burning.
00:26:12 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
He's burning. This is not possible.
00:26:16 - mark sweet
We're getting 40%. That's interesting.
00:26:19 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, exactly.
00:26:22 - mark sweet
Okay, so I don't think there's a problem with obviously, but I can't That's what it is.
00:26:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so it's still pretty cool. love that we're really getting into the stuff that we've been wanting to know and just look at the visual. There's no comparison to you. Getting the numbers and writing them down in text and then seeing a chart like this. to see the contrast across things. There's just no comparison.
00:27:05 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, that's my question, right? So if you scroll up and look at that 40% and Lorenz is 50-50, literally, or he's actually probably 62-58.
00:27:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, look, I nailed it.
00:27:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
want one more thing. Crazy, yeah. I look at that and go, what does that mean? This is question for you, Mark. What does that mean, and is it a problem?
00:27:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, because he's actually hitting, so this is less than 40%. This is 40%. So more often than not, he's hitting 40%, whereas Samantha, 74 of them, she did not get the 40% and go away. 39, she got the full 40%.
00:27:51 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Then it would be, if you can go move the needle with coachable person Lorenz and figure out how to... to further increase his number, right? My argument is gonna be, it can be done through systems. If you can understand what makes this member happen, then you can optimize to improve the improvement.
00:28:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then can that be sort of distributed to the team, saying, hey, is the way we do this now. And it has nothing to do with people. It's like, hey, this is the process.
00:28:26 - mark sweet
Right. There's one issue which I have to bring up. If we've settled the case, well, there's two things. If we settled the case in under 90 days, it's a third. It's not 40% by our contract. Interesting. there's some contracts that have to get clients assigned without a third flag.
00:28:48 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So. Is that denoted anywhere in Lidifier now? Nope. Okay. Okay.
00:28:55 - mark sweet
That definitely means more, but we don't put it in.
00:28:58 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. So, back to presses.
00:29:06 - mark sweet
But basically, anything that's not a third or 40% is probably a problem.
00:29:13 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:29:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we need to find a way where a case that has been incentivized to sign by the one third is marked so that we can start tracking that immediately.
00:29:30 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, like what percentage of cases are even that?
00:29:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And also, are people using that tactic prematurely? Are they costing you money?
00:29:40 - mark sweet
No, they have to get your first.
00:29:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, that's good to know.
00:29:46 - mark sweet
And look, look, I'll do it. I don't think I've ever said no. I've said no to when they want like 25%. I don't think I've said no.
00:29:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How often do you feel like you do that?
00:30:00 - mark sweet
No. And once you're twice week, maybe eight cases a month. Yeah, and then minors as well by law, we can't charge more than 25%.
00:30:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how often does that happen?
00:30:16 - mark sweet
We try to avoid taking minors whenever we can. That's maybe two cases a month.
00:30:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so that still doesn't change this, that there, there are tactics and operations inside of these numbers because this is, this is for the whole year. Let's just look at last year because we had most of this team all of last year. Okay, so 76 79. So. There's a little change there, but Samantha's still consistently getting under 40%. That's not quite like two thirds of the time, but close and then Tyler, that's pretty big. So that was an entire year last year.
00:31:24 - mark sweet
So if you go into and you look at, hey, if it's a weird percentage, you're going to know they had to reduce that.
00:31:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're going to know they had what?
00:31:34 - mark sweet
To reduce down their percentage. like go back into it for details. For which one?
00:31:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Any of them. Okay.
00:31:42 - mark sweet
Just look at Tyler. Or I guess the sub 40% for yeah. Okay. Just click it. Okay. Okay. That's not what I was looking at. The ones that are not 40%.
00:32:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
00:32:09 - mark sweet
So like a 20.12%, yeah, we clearly reduced down our food. 28.4% clearly reduced down our food.
00:32:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so.
00:32:23 - mark sweet
That's the average effect. So it's detailed real, bottom. Okay, so see, like the first matter on pedestrians, 33 and a third, that could have been just because that was all we could do on it, but like one right above the 26%. Yeah, we clearly dropped down our food.
00:32:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so is that sending 100% we should have done? And you did it to keep the business like. It was.
00:32:59 - mark sweet
Can you click on that file? I'll tell you exactly why. Because it was a monocomp and that was what the judge ordered us.
00:33:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And anything else? What is this?
00:33:25 - mark sweet
I don't know. That's what I do. Okay. Shh. I'm taking one. Okay, I'm not sure how to fix this issue. There's two distributions ones for the $10,000 med pay. And of that, we've got the 3,333. Of the 250,000, about 83,333. So if you scroll up. You can see there's two resolutions. So once for 10 and once for 250. the total that we got was 93,000. So we've got the third. But I don't know what the system is only showing 3,333.
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
00:35:01 - mark sweet
Against 260.
00:35:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, why?
00:35:12 - mark sweet
Because gross attorneys, he's shown three thousand three three. Someone put that in. Cool.
00:35:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So coaching.
00:35:23 - mark sweet
Yeah, I guess is more.
00:35:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I'm asking like that's the whole point of digging deep into this stuff is clarity and and just looking at what what should be coached and but also if there's confusion, what is the impact of the confusion. Is it significant? Is it just because we're looking at the report and that's the only thing that's confusing or.
00:35:52 - mark sweet
The confusion came from because they're different times. if you scroll way down, I don't even have to do access to work shows when updating the quick books. And so. So for QuickBooks, the 333 and the 85 or whatever it is, is at different times. So see, QuickBooks currently is 823, I'm honored if that was the issue.
00:36:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. And I wonder, too, how this report is being captured, is it by, it's not by resolution? Because there were two different resolutions, No, it had the gross word operating.
00:36:30 - mark sweet
we got paid because the only way that you can pull it is from the gross attorney fee. And you can see the effective percentage.
00:36:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK.
00:36:39 - mark sweet
Because that's not the resolution, but gross amount. Well, add it together to the gross amount.
00:36:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So is there anything that needs to be fixed because we see this?
00:36:53 - mark sweet
That's the main question, or move along. I need to talk with Michelle to see if there's some reason why we're doing it differently. And there may be a valid reason. I just don't know what it is.
00:37:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so I want to make sure I capture this as something that we can follow up with. Um, to show about. It's the most succinct way to write it down.
00:37:19 - mark sweet
Uh, attorneys be.
00:37:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well. Um, based on the reports. In percent. Sure. point. Ex percent. right. Go back here. Okay. So then this is. For last year and we were. I'm at this. Okay, Nick is the living dealer. Patrick's the new one on Arizona.
00:38:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay.
00:38:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is Timorens average, okay. But so that's interesting that her average gross attorney fee is 17k. But she hits 40% less often than Lorenz. How do these correlate?
00:38:36 - mark sweet
I would look a lot more on the average fee by team than anything else.
00:38:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:38:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, yeah, and the expected 40 is dirty right now. It's not real, because if these other ones that Mark highlighted earlier are in there, there's no way they're getting filtered out. Right. we first have to figure out how to filter them out. Whereas this one is probably not dirty.
00:39:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, that's what I was saying. maybe we should look into it a little bit and see. If anything. Oh, and it does.
00:39:17 - mark sweet
Wait a minute.
00:39:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How so that calculates this in here. Also just interesting. Some of those eternity. How much eternity. How much of those eternity. And the reason I'm really interesting.
00:39:42 - mark sweet
little bit better is because. I mean, I showed you what they're getting out of the case. they're The rinses and hanks should be higher generally speaking because they're working in states with higher limit.
00:39:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh.
00:39:58 - mark sweet
Until January then. Corning goes and matches roughly the same as everyone else.
00:40:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So this is interesting too. want to go look at somebody else, but that the types of incidents where you hit 40 percent versus it's not.
00:40:15 - mark sweet
Don't it's it's in this moment. It's not OK, just because the vast, vast, vast majority of work, this is our driver past. OK, I completely get why you look at that because that will be what I look at too. But in our case, it's just going to to be way off because based on those, we should take lots and lots and lots of and falls where the reality is we don't want to do that.
00:40:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got you. Good to know. OK, so let's just take a look at runs here. Um, one record. Okay. Okay, it's just a new way to look at information. I'm just kind of processing it. Um, is there anything, so let's just take a look at these reports a little bit more and just kind of look at it as an, and evaluate it as a report. What, uh, do we, what else do we want to kind of look into?
00:41:52 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Like my brain is feeling overwhelmed now because I'm just like taking it. I like many that's a new.
00:42:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
interesting view so the doctor referrals to that seems weird that are less than 40 percent no that's not weird well it's like it's a you know it's sort of the lead quality in a way but maybe not also because the doctors only know they're going to get paid in full they sometimes goose their bell a little bit and i can't take that out on a client so i will i'll be reduced on my feet before you know that's the doctor who referred me at least reduced on their feet yeah so this is interesting considering the cost of monkey leads where's like where's walker oh yeah walkers looks good more than half just a little bit more than half you're interesting all these new ways to evaluate things And then average fee by source, but this has to be for the whole year and that can be for the whole year. is this period is for last year. I'm trying to figure out how to decipher this because I know we spend way more than this.
00:43:32 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So this is like the value of the source, average value of the fees by source.
00:43:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry. This is different. So with is this then per instance. The like the average across each incident.
00:43:55 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, it's just that source. However many they have, right. So, Dragonhead won at 92,000 and then the average 92,000.
00:44:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. Got it. This is interesting. So, let's look at Walker versus Monkey. That's pretty interesting. That's for all of last year. Monkey's double Walker.
00:44:32 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:44:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mark.
00:44:39 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:44:40 - mark sweet
All you can do is move it at this point. don't have any access.
00:44:45 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
yeah. They're ready. They're not ready for you.
00:44:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, let me click on things like I'll be your hands here. Human mouse. Yeah. What do you want to see? Okay.
00:45:02 - mark sweet
I just want to dig into those details.
00:45:06 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That's a thing.
00:45:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know what you're looking for. You just start looking like, oh, but you start making me start beautiful minding. You're like, oh, wait a second. I can see Mark doing that. Okay, so dig into this.
00:45:22 - mark sweet
This one is called.
00:45:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you can is what I mean.
00:45:27 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Log in is Lauren.
00:45:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, duh.
00:45:30 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Seriously.
00:45:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's exactly what you do.
00:45:35 - mark sweet
I am. I'm viewing it. This is ignoring.
00:45:40 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Go over the crew.
00:46:00 - mark sweet
What happened? Kind of change your owner domain. See how that makes any difference.
00:46:03 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
You do whatever you like.
00:46:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:46:11 - mark sweet
Nope. Same issue.
00:46:14 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Thank you.
00:46:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, that was like.
00:46:18 - mark sweet
a few minutes. I need to make sure that we get one thing covered because it's directly talking. The HQ intake thing. sent a quick email about it. I didn't want to forget about it. They're getting a lot of leads. We're saying no to a bunch of those leads, but then it's stopping. Where normally we would refer those out.
00:46:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When your internal intake does it, it gets referred out. But when HQ intake does it, it doesn't get referred out. They just stop. get no money out of them. Okay. So, they're not referring out.
00:47:02 - mark sweet
Right.
00:47:06 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
What, because they don't know or because they're.
00:47:11 - mark sweet
Oh, they don't they wait.
00:47:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, they need to go to your intake team. So, your intake team can refer it out.
00:47:21 - mark sweet
Can we do that? That will be fine.
00:47:26 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So, they're on the phone with someone and they're like, oh, this isn't sweet law level, but it could be signed. Right.
00:47:35 - mark sweet
don't call me today about a case that, you know, they hadn't treated in 60 days, like someone might want that.
00:47:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, well, they don't do it or they don't know to do it. Like, could you go to Robert?
00:47:50 - mark sweet
They're like, hey, dude, I give you 300 bucks for those. No, because I don't want to spend that kind of money on it because they need to work absolutely nothing.
00:47:59 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, I mean, I was making.
00:48:00 - mark sweet
But also, I don't really want people in referring cases, right?
00:48:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you somehow need that to then bloomerang back to the internal team. Yeah, that's not going to happen.
00:48:20 - mark sweet
Okay.
00:48:21 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I mean, not the current, so I sent too many email. So, funnily enough. So I'm getting on the horn with the ads. Certainly got as on Thursday. I reached out to Robert and was like, Hey, bro, we got to get you off of a law ruler. And I was like, I've been in this industry forever. And so I could get you on a better system. He hasn't responded yet, but then Avery from. Certainly I emailed a bunch of stuff over the weekend. He wants to get on a call on Thursday. He's going to take me behind the scenes of some of their stuff because I was asking. A bunch more data questions than I think he likes. That he's like, oh, I'm happy to show you. I'm happy to take it behind the curtain. I'm like, all right. But he was saying today that HQ, he's like, dude, they need help because he's saying their sign-up rate is dropping. He's saying it was twice as good six months ago. And I go, well, I know what their problem is. The problem is they have a system. And if we fix their system, then they'll do better. But if we also get them on leave flowy, then this ricochet idea or boomerang idea is completely doable. Because we would just give them a tag, and then it would send it back to your account. So I guess now more than ever, I need to get this dude to switch or get on the path to switching. Yeah, it would be rad. It would be great to be inside. They do a good job. But even I don't even like some of the stuff. Like I wish I knew. The last time they touched something right there up trying to reach so and so I'm like when when was this? Like is this is it three days ago? Is it was it this morning? can't you can't see that they send that Terrible spreadsheet like this is not good. No, it's a terrible spreadsheet. Yeah, it's not good enough and if they're trying he's saying they've scaled up But if they're scaled up and their results are getting that doesn't me they scaled up and their results are getting worse That's that's not good. No All right, so I might need you to if he doesn't respond to me, I'm gonna CC you like I And then you can you could be the heavy mark because he fears you You're the checkbook I'm just his path the greater income come on which I'm gonna eat HQ intake people? Yeah, they their setup is not cutting it.
00:51:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who's the he?
00:51:07 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Robert.
00:51:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Robert. Just for my brain when I hear that and like okay now I know what we're talking about.
00:51:16 - mark sweet
in the meantime do we want to start pulling more back? I mean how much is that costing you? That seems like maybe again it's here's why I'm having trouble answering that question. It's no guarantee that someone's going to take the case period. Right. And my average like your forophy of not big vaccines is pretty damn low.
00:51:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so we have to is it is it financially more sound for you to keep HQ intake knowing that you could lose um money for the referred out.
00:52:00 - mark sweet
or to not have them at all and just well it comes down to how well they're converting right if they're converting for us better than we're converting then you know the referrals are obviously a much more percentage of it right but so far it seems like their conversion rate is not just more from the harsh it's not it's nearly identical so why am i gonna pay extra money for the same thing right the difference is they work on the weekends better than we work on the weekends that's it so then maybe just use them on the weekends but the problem is once the leads with them the leaders put them right then you then you get into this situation of you can't have double calling but that is plausible for sure i mean that could be a tweak so like a large part of you wants to pull the quantified leads from them to us, but they are the ones that gave us that want to buy as a source and hesitant to do that.
00:53:06 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And they're crushing it. conversion rate on those is crazy. So maybe that's because they want to keep, now they have two masters, right? So when they're getting monkey leads and they have one master, just you. They don't know . I think there's a little of that gone on so with quantifieds for sure that it's like oh yeah no you've got two masters and you're going to keep quantified happy and mark because they're both your clients.
00:53:49 - mark sweet
Now let's keep it going but it's just something to think about is there a better way for even if it's like a robber of hey any that you call me and reject like shoot me the email on it so at least I can work for it out to someone else.
00:54:01 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, let me think about if there's an easy way, like there's got to be, if I can think of a signal, we could for sure give them a form maybe, and then they just submit the form. Let me think about it, like, because that the next guys we gave them, I gave them, we created a form for them to use, and that's how they do stuff, if the bot doesn't get it. But with these guys, it could be like, hey, in this scenario, then go fill out this form, and maybe all they have to do is submit the email address, and then when that matches the record, we just switch a route inside a leaf flowy back to whatever. I'll see if that's a thing, I'll see if we can pull just that functionality would work. Or even send an email to leave flowy with the email address, that might not be enough. Let me think about it, one of those, one of those two.
00:55:00 - mark sweet
I think we're working. There's going to be a way that they can just send it back to us.
00:55:04 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Or, yeah, well, not to you to like an automation. Yes.
00:55:10 - mark sweet
Right. Yeah. There's a referral portal within what if I, but not everyone's on it. So it would just need to go back to pats here and intake to refer out. We can just zap it with a, you know, rejected or for out as a title. And then it's tracking, we're tracking that.
00:55:33 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:55:34 - mark sweet
As well. I mean, I don't want to downplay, but yeah, it ends up being, I think on average about 50 grand a month of referrals. No. So it's like, it's a significant amount.
00:55:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Well, then you get that metric too.
00:55:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then it's like, are they even Steven on both these things? Yes.
00:55:52 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Then maybe you're like, okay, we're only ever going to leave the quantify. But right now you could be missing those with quantifies. what could be happening, right? quantify such a high conversion rate, would they not have a high conversion rate of referrals too? seems like mathematically that would be true. I'll figure out it's one of those two ways. I'll figure it out.
00:56:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The great thing is the secondary effect of or just kind of what you call it, not effect consequence basically of expanding operations and trying these different things is that we're looking at it from a new perspective and that new perspective generally is more value because we understand it in a way that we didn't understand it before. Figure out how to measure and tracking if we weren't measuring and tracking before, which means that we can then figure out how to optimize things that we weren't optimizing before, which leads us to, you know, that greater of average business more from less. So, You know anyway keep doing this.
00:57:02 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, yeah, you're right. That gets this. It's a scenario. was talking about like this problems. We solved the problem and then the problem solved. Now, it is a problem other people are having for us go solve it for them. But in solving our problem with Robert through Robert, it's going to make his business better and our business better.
00:57:26 - mark sweet
Yes, unfortunately and unfortunately, but hopefully that.
00:57:28 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yes, exactly. goes some more yin and yang. Well, yeah, then you become his investor mark.
00:57:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You need a back.
00:57:38 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Take a piece of that .
00:57:40 - mark sweet
Leverage that. We might.
00:57:45 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm serious. I was joking, but I'm like, I wonder where he's really at, right? Like, what is going on over there? Because that ties into what you had said years ago, you know, somewhat tongue in cheek. You're like by the advertising. Well, I was actually talking to Salgo, and I said, he pointed this out, and I was like, oh, I haven't thought about that. He didn't say it like this, but he's like, have you guys basically solved the intake thing with these HQ people?
00:58:15 - mark sweet
And I was like, oh , yeah, I guess we have.
00:58:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Because for years I kept telling him, we don't have a lead gen problem. We have a retainer siding problem. Well, that problem no longer exists, really. So if the triad is firm, tech, intake, HQ, advertising agency, right, whatever, like leads, I would say leads, agency leads, then you're done though. So it's the proverbial owned the race courses, James Rinko would say, yeah. It's also like, like leveraged the race course, right? That was the other thing I was thinking, like, these ads certainly got some, like, they're, they're good. And it's like, if you can make them better, and then somehow let, like, leverage them and maybe leveraging them is like. You know, part of me was like, create, go create Arizona firm, right? When I read that the other day, I was like, oh, they just did it wrong. That was, I'm serious. That was their problem. They did it wrong. They didn't know the math, but the reality is nobody knows the math, right? So all the math is right here, like, look at it. Look at these dashboards. No one's building these. No one knows this stuff this intimately. And it's that that's how you can then go, hey, give me an investor, right? That's where I'm just going to make up. But it's like, that's where you go to Omar and say, hey, give me a bunch of money to invest in a law firm, where you go to, or you don't, you don't get an investor at all and you just go build this Arizona firm with. the bunch of non-lawyers and show them that they can get a piece of the back end if they're good at the thing that they're good at.
01:00:08 - mark sweet
Which is generating the case, which everyone's gonna do and as we clearly know, is not the case.
01:00:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, exactly.
01:00:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So you have to build, like if you can build that team, they're never gonna do it, right? So it's like, that's an opportunity that's there if you can get the right pieces on the board. Like, it's my whole thing, right? idea and money execution. Well, money, not a problem. It would be easy to get money from that. Idea, done. We just laid it out. Then it just comes down to execution, right? Those guys had idea and money and they filled an execution. They filled an execution because they had no idea what they were doing because they went and hired an agent. I loved the part where they hired a PR firm. Like, really, that's where you spend money. Yeah, good lord. Shoot me. But whatever. So don't hire a P. When we still need to figure out how to generate the leaves. Yeah, exactly.
01:01:15 - mark sweet
And sorry, not just how to generate the cost effect.
01:01:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yes, and own it.
01:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Well, and quality.
01:01:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:01:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. anyway, these new reports are awesome.
01:01:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Tell Josh he rocks and we'll keep him for a while. Anyway, yeah, it's going good.
01:01:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that's it for this week. It also, it's time and I don't know what you guys have, but I get to get going.
01:01:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
But this is good.
01:01:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
have fun with that.
01:01:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Mark, is there anything? Dan, you can dip if you want to. Let's check on Mark.
01:01:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will. I need a drink.
01:01:54 - mark sweet
I need a I need a drink.
01:01:57 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
need
01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He like, oh my God, mid-sentence.
01:02:02 - mark sweet
Yep, he was done. He was done. He I'm oh my God.
01:02:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my God, he's like, I pulled the click. I'm like, oh, That was too funny. so was there anything that we didn't bring up that you want to bring up?
01:02:22 - mark sweet
No, I think that was everything. was trying to figure out how we would squeeze every single thing out of everything, just given how much we spend.
01:02:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so I think, though, that our ability to even ask the questions that lead to those answers are going to be greatly improved the more that we look at this type of stuff. That's the biggest thing, because usually the answer doesn't come until you ask the question. And a lot of times, we don't give enough, I can't think of the word that I want, but wait. sickly to what it takes to get to the right question. And it's a series of questions. And the series of answers like the real question, the real answer comes through just continuing to probe and get there. But the tools to improve our questions come through this dashboard that we've been building and making and took forever and that we told ourselves couldn't even happen in the first place because we spent a year and a half saying, let if I can't do it, like it's a whole process. But we are getting answers because we kept asking questions. So I think our ability to get there just, not only you got closer to it, but I think the pace at our ability to answer questions better and get to better questions is improving because of this. This structure and organization is going to lead to that. If you have a second question, Can we talk about setting up times with Patrick and Lorenz? Does it need to wait?
01:04:07 - mark sweet
No, I would just email them direct. don't know what their schedule is looking like necessarily, especially while they're in Patrick. But I've told them that you're going to be your chance.
01:04:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, I don't have Patrick's information.
01:04:20 - mark sweet
I don't have. I don't have either one of their contact information. At your gets to law.com and more ends at speedlaw.com.
01:04:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Super easy. OK, I can do that.
01:04:29 - mark sweet
Again, as you can tell, I started the firm. didn't necessarily expect to have a lot of people. If it's no first name, no last name. Yeah. OK, yeah, it's only turned into an issue once.
01:04:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's funny, but that's it's OK because you actually don't want to have a ton of people. You just want to have a of money. OK, so I will do that. But is it OK with you? Because I would prefer to CC you on everything. Yeah, for a while. Okay and it's that way you're in the loop and um so what I wanted to do was talk to Patrick first just a one-on-one then Patrick and Lorenz then Lorenz then and just keep alternating that way but the individual follow-up will happen throughout the week regardless so there may be um group conversations where I'm like okay this is applicable to both of you and then it might just be I don't need to bother Lorenz with what Patrick's working on I don't need to bother Patrick with what Lorenz is working on that kind of thing so a few different conversation threads just because it's a few different people anyway but that's my plan of going in and then reporting to you I could report on this Monday call we could have a separate just it could be an email report and then we could have this Monday call for now and then depending on how it goes we know it's going be more important. Okay, sounds good. I think that's all that I have. So is there anything else that you needed?
01:06:08 - mark sweet
No, I think those are the major things. So yeah, she's getting really moving.
01:06:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I will follow up with Dr. B today because I'm just looking her up. Like she looks awesome.
01:06:20 - mark sweet
Hopefully. Yeah, I'm gonna see her this afternoon.
01:06:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Oh, yeah, send that plug. I've got I've got lots of time today after 1.30. So and I've saved her contact. So I don't know if I get it. All right. You taking care of yourself?
01:06:36 - mark sweet
Right now I'm trying to figure out charity attacks issues. That does not answer my question, Mark.
01:06:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, it will make people laugh at her once I get it figured out. if you take care of yourself, you're it. mean,

That's weird, it's like grey, hi, hello, how are you, good and well, yeah, deep breath.
00:00:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, today is, this is our, my work week, so it's every day, every day, lots of meetings for me today, but I just came from a saw, so I'm trying to wake back up because she put me out.
00:00:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
awesome. Yes, my lady, she's a Russian and she's been taking care of me for years and I just go like, like, I get baby like little girl taking care of and I'm like, oh, it's the best so. And then I was like, Booty paid for this today. Hey, glad to, glad to accountability. I like felt bad about it for a minute. I'm like, well, you use the one that wants accountability and you needed this. So we just get you to do your stuff without punishment. Then I'll pay for my own. Just happily. And you will have learned the thing.
00:01:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't feel bad at all. I didn't get it.
00:01:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what are you ready to work on this today?
00:01:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
looks like you are. Yeah, so this is from July. I'm like, you know, like we talked about two weeks ago, we hired the manager. been really good. I've been giving him, you know, little by little bit, giving him some of the tasks that I do, of which, you know, tracking the numbers is one of them. So we expanded this based on what we talked about, I think, two weeks ago. then last week we completed it. And so these are pretty much all of our data as far as we can go back and track. So we opened in April of 2023 and you can see we got 87 people that first month, we didn't really keep track of it then so we just started it the next month but essentially after that we started tracking how many new visits we completed and these are the follow-ups and you can kind of actually see that we were actually doing okay in some of the months like you know some of the ones last month we got 94 so this month we're we're act you know like we talked about we're actively trying to seek out second visits and third visits from from case managers. Awesome.
00:02:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to process the data but also I have some immediate thoughts. A couple of things are number one I would like to put a formula after column B which is basically the current month divided by the previous month. or, you know, and going up and down so that we're looking at a percentage of change, increase or decrease month to month, just kind of eyeballing the fluctuation on a percentage level. The raw numbers are helpful, but just that other perspective just kind of helps take a look at things. And it also is a faster way of triggering an appropriate level of alarm or yay, you know, celebration when you see those percentages. So we can do that pretty easily. And then I know that we don't know what you get paid per visit. I know that that's a unique thing. But what I would like to do is, and we were starting to calculate just kind of average fee per visit. I know how not accurate that number is. I am aware of that. But it gives us something to look at that does have a real corollary value, you know, to kind of look at how things are going. So as long as we keep that in perspective and don't, you know, and I know you won't, but just, you know, I'm not going to go. That's a real number. That would be something that would be good for us to do as well. Sorry about that. Let's see. It's all of us. It's okay. we're tracking Washington, Arizona, Mexico, familiar state to me. I'm meeting with Jonah and Margaret too. this is, this is my sweet love, oogee day. Good people. I like good people. All of us is completed. I love that that number went up. up even though number of referrals went down. So, let's see, actually, never mind. Okay, so total NP is completed. That's what I actually want to look at. And how many of those were referrals? NPV. What does NPV stand for? It's the first one.
00:05:18 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It's initial new patient visits.
00:05:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, a new patient visits. Okay. I was like, I know, think that that's initial, but I don't know of course. I think she massaged my brain just late. Okay, so that didn't go down that went up. That's awesome. That number had a couple of dips out of curiosity. Do you happen to have any idea what happened in November and December that your numbers went down? could you pinpoint that to anything? Or is that just? July is referrals and so this isn't like Q and me is the one that has a lot of you, right? Yeah, this is July. Okay. Um any idea what that dip was about?
00:06:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, you know, this is actually up in so up in these first six months I did all the marketing myself, meaning I'm calling, you know, was calling case managers like Mark's team and I was just begging them to send me a client and in October I actually stopped and I I bought three different marketing companies. So I put each of them charged me $1500 a month to market for me and I I said, Hey, let's try it. So I I tried three different companies. Only one of them actually did anything and I cut the other two off. But that's what happened in October and November is I stopped doing it myself. And I think you could see like by January like the three marketing companies, they started getting a little traction help me out a little bit. But the first few months that I stopped doing anything on my own, this is what happened.
00:07:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So are you still doing it?
00:07:08 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, I'm just using one marketing company and yeah.
00:07:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:07:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And again, like this, you know, this value for a number of referrals is where I always wanted to be was about 400 a month. I thought just 400 referrals a month was good. know, 400 total visits would also be about right. So, you know, if we can get this every month combined with this number of total visits. That's actually kind of where I want to sit.
00:07:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But let's highlight those.
00:07:39 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. But you know, the other thing that Mark was saying is that, you know, we're worried about the insurance is tracking me and trying to become too big. But I, you know, I hadn't really talked to Mark about what, hey, what if I go after just other states, right? know, and obviously they're tracking me in California, but what if I really try to. higher or do the marketing myself in Arizona and in Mexico, Washington, and really try to grow the volume there. But I haven't really explored that.
00:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, can we make that a task? I didn't mean you make it a point of talking to him before we meet next week.
00:08:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, that'd be fun. Because it's really tough to end.
00:08:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And the sooner we know, the better. I heard that you guys might be having the most epic 24 hours ever.
00:08:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Well, I just bought a car like I told you. And then last next week, we're buying a $4 million house. yeah, yeah, I will not be participating this year unless it becomes a little bit.
00:08:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think he had quoted like 50,000 a person.
00:08:48 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, it's like, I don't know about that one.
00:08:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you just had a brownie baby. And that's a little bit on the dangerous side. If I was us or I'd be like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, But that's just probably way cooler than me.
00:09:03 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, she's actually letting me go to my friends for you for a big, it's next month.
00:09:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
yeah, it's different than like drifting, okay? And just like, oh, that's crazy. I saw that like my heart.
00:09:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah.
00:09:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It looked really cool to do.
00:09:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Father updates on July front to help us meet this volume I actually brought on a fifth provider. It's a physician assistant network like all the four physician assistants and nurse practitioners that are working for me, all like they like working for me. So they're all like, hey, can my friend get a job with you? So I finally picked one that looked good. And so we brought her on. She's actually starting right now. She took a shift from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. So she's seeing patients like right as we speak, this is her first day. So yeah, excited to do that. It'll increase our nighttime. And she's going to help in the evenings. weekends, particularly.
00:10:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that'll help our capacity at those times to accommodate this volume. And what do you pay for that?
00:10:08 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I pay $75 a visit, whether it's a new or whether it's a return. And I increase their salary or I increase their pay to $30 after like six weeks.
00:10:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so it's still a good margin for you and let you increase capacity without burning out?
00:10:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah, I mean, I mean, yeah, on average, we make about what 300 per visit blended between using returns, right? So I'm paying them $30 and then my staffing costs about probably about $30 on the back end for each visit, so.
00:10:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so yeah, that's good. And they're per visit, not per hour.
00:10:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Yeah, totally per visit. I also pay them to if some patients want like a doctor's out to be excused off work. So I pee smell everything. charge, we charge for that. I charge for that to the lawyers. And then I subsequently pay them $12 if they write a work note for someone. And what do you charge for it? I charge $300 and I generally get paid about 50 on that.
00:11:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But $300 for the doctor's note?
00:11:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
For the doctor's.
00:11:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, okay. But you only get 50 out of it because of the way that, okay, got it, got it.
00:11:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I mean, I've been about 25%. So yeah, so maybe 60.
00:11:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. So another formula that I want to have is the percentage of our PVs to NPVs. So that we're looking at.
00:11:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
You know, I feel like we, I was supposed to do this. Do you think you could find the notes from last week? I was just looking real quick. I think we actually talked about. doing these things I just never did them.
00:12:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, and I didn't send a follow-up to actually make it an official task, but we did for sure.
00:12:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I wasn't so familiar. So I'll work on those and get them done.
00:12:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and I mean, ultimately, and the faster we do this, the better your results are, right? And my goal is to make sure that you see the value in showing up and doing this work every week. This could be as possible because I want you to keep coming back. was like working with the same people. It's really nice for me. We do, we do. go. And the notes, that tasks.
00:12:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So I wanted to show you this one. This is something that you had kind of brought up about how we can track our workers remotely. so I want to the metrics that the manager and I came up with, it was just we look at their call logs like literally how many patients did you call a day right because if we know how many new visits or how many new referrals we got you know so if we got 300 in August that means there should have been there's 20 working days or there's 22 working days so there should have been like what 10, 15 calls a day and so and then obviously if you don't get someone the first day we call them at the second day so like if you can't look at any two days generally about right like they're calling you know most work days they're calling about not so many they're calling 20, 30 people a day something like that now Ollie Ollie actually works part-time she only works four hours and Eric and Carolina were eight hours so it is actually kind of interesting like most of the times it's almost double but there's some days where you see like she does almost as many as my full-timers so it's something the manager and I are going to look at, and this is the blended average so far that we created here.
00:14:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what I would do additionally is actually put in the hours just so you again, there's something that is really powerful, and this is why we use the visuals, and also why we do specific types of formula and put data in a particular kind of way. Because what we want to do is make our brains be able to rapid-fire, get to the most powerful conclusion. So if you were to do that, put hours for each one of them, and then create a formula that were average calls per hour. Okay, we did that. Yeah, so oh there it is. I'm just focused. have tons of I thought it was. and I thought it would be the other way around. Wait, okay. So, when you say Eric slash Carol, how do I say that?
00:15:06 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, he has wife split a full shift. So he does the morning and she knows you does four hours in the afternoon.
00:15:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, is that column H hours or calls?
00:15:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
This is this column is how many total on average they did for day.
00:15:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so where are you getting the formula for calls for hours? where are you getting hours in your formula?
00:15:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Or did you just plug it in? Oh, we first we looked at just the total number of months or total number of calls they made in a month right here. And then we divided it by how many hours they work, hundreds in general.
00:15:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I was wondering where the hours came into the equation. Okay, so, because I thought you said that I like got more calls done.
00:16:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah, this is actually wrong. Yeah. She only worked 80. Yeah. that is right. Yeah. that's right. Yeah. That was wrong.
00:16:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ally is actually working like double speed. Yeah. that is significant. And let's, I mean, if we were gonna have to do even math. mean, that's roughly like 50% more.
00:16:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't know how to use percentages.
00:16:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you do? in this case, you would divide 1.52 by 2.46 times about 100. No, just divide. You'll get the same thing.
00:16:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We just move the decimal point. That's all. Yeah, she's doing 61% more. I don't know it.
00:16:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, that doesn't make sense.
00:16:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
She's. Yes, she's doing 61% more. Yeah.
00:17:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah, because if she was doing 200 percent, we'll see.
00:17:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
she's doing 100 more than that would be 3.
00:17:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:17:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Yeah. So she's doing 60% more.
00:17:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then two people. So either one of them is very slow or both of them are slow. Or maybe she's just super fast and we do have we do get lucky sometimes and get because like Mark Scott, this girl Samantha and she kills everybody. She smokes everybody. She is a massively driven. You can't just go get us a man but you can't. So that might be what but it's worth looking into. It's worth considering. Do we share team numbers? Do we drive internal competition and incentive by saying here's the targets and here's the and maybe we don't want to because like the other issue Mark has is way too much incentive in his program and he's paying too much in payroll for it so we have to do the math before you offer any kind of incentive program but for sure at the very least this is something we need to be contemplating and not just look at and take it and go like okay that's dinner and not do anything we're there to be such a big disparity either you've got a rock star or you've got slackers and if it's a slacker situation then that's something that can potentially be trained potentially be incentivized or potentially you replace them but either way it's something to be thinking about
00:19:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, you want to look at China?
00:19:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see her say hi. Oh, my gosh.
00:19:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Hi. Hello. Yeah, we were just going to go take a nap and say we're going to say hi to daddy and then go take a nap.
00:19:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, my gosh. I missed the little one so bad.
00:19:19 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, so beautiful and perfect.
00:19:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's just a perfect blend of the two of you.
00:19:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Hi. It's hard to tell her right now. I know they're so young. Yeah. Just trying to get to sleep in her own crib so she's not like contact napping all the time. Oh, just like you can't give anything done during the day.
00:19:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I remember that battle and I wish I had leaned into it way more than I did because that goes so fast.
00:19:53 - Fujinaka, M.D.
You cannot believe how fast it goes.
00:19:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so I shouldn't try to train her out of it too quickly. So here's the thing. you sleep very well with that Puji?
00:20:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I sleep better without him.
00:20:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We both agree that we sleep better like separately. Everybody is different but it's been interesting you know because I've got two that are all the way grown. I've got two grandkids and two that are mostly grown plus sisters and siblings and just working with people along that. There's this huge, I don't know, we all listen to different things and feel different things but trying to get kids to sleep alone and and parents get frustrated that they won't do it and those people, most of them don't want to sleep alone can't sleep alone and it's funny that they want really tiny children just to be able to be alone and be comfortable when it's not the natural thing. are cultures that are never away from their children. They pack them onto their backs. They don't mean you see that a lot and co-sleeping is just a lot more common and other cultures around the world. Yeah, so but you know when you're a driven mama and you have an active brain and you want to use your brain That's an important thing to and taking care of you is an important thing, and so it's difficult But the one thing I would say is whatever your heart calls you to do Lean into your heart more than your brain Your brain will get outlets later, but if you hurt your heart that damage can be So long-lasting and that's where the regrets come from not helping your brain I promise you Okay, that's good advice.
00:21:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I want to take out more of your precious hour with Tina, so Thank you wanted to show you something else that I am working on You want to So, okay, so this is where I really Can you coach to step in over the board? Yes, but yeah, I'll just show you what I am done.
00:22:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yes, the Bing.
00:22:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Bing background. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, so I have an online clinic and I have a company. We haven't like we just sort of started, but we market this thing. You get a brain MRI.
00:22:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you see my screen? I can and you told me a little bit about that.
00:22:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So, yeah, so anyway, I just, just kind of, we're just starting. this. And again, the payment structures are fluctuated, but essentially my cost for this brain scan is $1,000 of my cost, and I'm reselling it for $2,500. So each sale makes me roughly $1,500. And yeah, anyway, so that's that. I am just starting it with the founder of this technology. So anyway, I spent all yesterday night making this payment platform and this website and getting the bank account set up. So finally, everything's ready to go. have the business registered, I have the bank now, I have the website. last piece I need to do is just structure the clinic side a little bit better because I'm serving all 50 states.
00:23:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and where do your customers come from?
00:23:56 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Right now, they come from the company itself. So this company BrainKey out of Germany, people email them from the United States and it's like, I want to get your brain scan and since they don't have a US presence, they are sending them to me.
00:24:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And they say, hey, you have the machine that can do it, basically?
00:24:18 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Well, we have contracts with the imaging centers. A lot of the same ones Mark uses for his PI cases, actually. I just go to them and get a contract with me. Okay. So that's why it's the $1000. So the $1000 is about 800 of it goes to the MRI center where I send them and then about 200 I send it to BrainKey to analyze the results.
00:24:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So the value is in BrainKey's evaluation and reporting or, okay, you give me a little bit more about the USP, which is the unique selling point of why, why then?
00:25:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, they're the only brain analysis software on the market that can do these volumetric measurements. So if you look on this little screen, they're sectioning out the brain based on what structure it is, and they actually measure how big it is. So we could track over time pretty clearly, like if you're developing Alzheimer's, you're going to see this really specific area of your brain, unfortunately, strength, They show that that part of your brain, the amygdala for alcohol actually shrinks, shrinks, shrinks. And we could see it get bigger when you get better sleep, when you stop drinking alcohol, et cetera.
00:25:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And who's your target market for this?
00:25:46 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Do you have an avatar or multiple avatars? Yes. it's usually it's Asian males that make over 150,000 a year, they're single or not single. But it's Asian males over 100, making over 150,000 a year that would be. between the ages of 40 and 50 and, like, 58 to 65-ish.
00:26:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much of that demographic is within your realm physically?
00:26:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
A lot, because most of them tend to live around the major city centers, where I have the contracts with the centers.
00:26:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And why Asian specifically?
00:26:25 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't know. I think, I don't know. not sure why it's Asian. I mean, obviously, I think the majority is like, they're like, it's 50-50 Asian white male. I'm not sure why. I personally think it's like the midlife crises that these people are dealing with in general. Like, why it's a lot of males and not as many females.
00:26:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could give you lots of reasons why it's probably more males and higher earning males, just because what got them to the higher earning was very stressful on their bodies. They overworked.
00:27:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
probably during too much did all the network too much.
00:27:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They did a lot of things that they probably shouldn't do and have gotten to the point where, especially now in this world, we're very aware of the clock ticking but as well the opportunity and the medical technology that can buy us another decade or two. Whereas women, not as competitive, do a lot of things that are better for their hearts, they talk to each other, they've got a network, they're more aware of health in general and probably haven't neglected it to the extent and are also less likely to go and pay and spend this amount of money on themselves for their health or rather they'd go get, you know, breast and butt lifts so they look good for the man because that's not really for them, that's for somebody else kind of thing but the psychology behind it makes perfect sense to me to say it's part does not necessarily make sense to me and it's not really necessary because You don't have to, in the marketing, target anything that would be Asian specific, but the reason I ask about the avatars is because you do want the marketing to speak to them wherever they're at, whatever their values are, and for sure there's a, there's a huge difference, I think, between Asians period because of the collectivist culture with just the standard American, which is the individualistic culture, the values, the reasons, the logic for doing things is different. And so, like if you were going to, and I don't really know how much that applies to Asians living in America as much, but anyway, just the language, right? So are you doing this for yourself versus doing this for your family? And you would probably want to split test some of the messages. We would probably want to have a few different landing pages and keywords research campaigns. based off of what's happening. What I would be interested to know is what they know about marketing that works in other areas and what they would be willing to share with you.
00:29:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, and the only one that does this here. Yeah, so that's what's interesting about this opportunity to me is because brain key right now is only sold through brick and mortar concierge clinics. So the only way they're getting customers is they go to a concierge doctor and says, hey, give this to your clients and those are their salesmen. I'm like the first mass market clinic for them. But yeah, but because of that, you don't really have a good sense of like who they're, you know, who's buying it or why they're buying it because all there's, they see the data, right? They see how old the person is male or female, just from the scan data, but they're not actually talking to their clients, which is really interesting. It's like, yeah.
00:30:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have any idea what percentage of doctors are Asian in your area or in any of the metro areas? Just wondering because culturalistically, more, let's say any other nationality to Asians, you're going have Asians and like Filipinos, which is a mix between Mexican and Asian, right? There's a huge drive to be doctors. So, I was wondering if the correlation just happens to be that there are more Asian doctors and they're pitching it to Asians because they're like, hey, I think you might like this more than some of these other people that don't, I don't know, like I'm trying to figure out what could that possibly, or could they have got that demographic from? anyway, my brain, I'm always trying to analyze because if you understand the demographic and the true data, then it makes marketing that much easier.
00:31:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So yeah, I just, yeah, the company, even like the owner, I, and I'm friends with the founder, he's just like, sorry, man, I like, I literally don't know because we don't sell this. It's only the upstairs doctors that sell it to their own clients. And yeah, like, I was like, well, do you have numbers? And he's like, well, not really.
00:31:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is your, when you first thought about this, and up until now, what was your plan of attack for marketing?
00:31:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Well, I actually talked to Mark a lot about this, and it was really just to run Google ads. our thought was as long as I could make, you know, as long as I can make $100 more than my ad spend, it's very straightforward business, right? Yeah, I'm just, essentially, just reselling this product. I'm like selling online.
00:31:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Has, has Mark ever mentioned Dan to you?
00:31:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No.
00:32:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Dan is a client that referred Mark to me that we do work together and Dan's very good at Google Ads and also Google Analytics. So especially because this is a new market, we're going to need to make sure that you've got analytics and that we're watching it closely. We're going to want to have a heat map on here. Do you know what a heat map is?
00:32:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Kind of like where they're looking and clicking.
00:32:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And we're also going to want to watch the behavior to find out what they're coming from. I think that some YouTube ads would probably be the most leverageable thing and the great thing of course is that combination between YouTube and Google is that you've got all of this data and they do, they're just really good at targeting by the algorithms, know, who might be interested in that. So if they're doing something that's relative like looking up a particular issue whose solution is you need an MRI. Guess who's at they're probably going to start up. Who's running ads for MRIs? Like nobody probably. I don't know. Anyway so creating some YouTube ads would probably be a good idea and a lot of that could probably be done with AI videos now. You know of course we could actually hire some people but most of it could be some either stock videos or a few like videos of the machine of the reports things like that with a voiceover which also could be AI. It could be a voice actor which we could pay very inexpensively off of Upwork something like that. You have a good voice. I think that's so weird but you're not anywhere near the first person to say that. I hated my voice until I was like mid 30s and Now I won't do video because I feel so gross and ugly. mean, I spent all Saturday. I spent my time doing videos for marketing. Can't do it. Anyway, this is life. We've all got our weird things.
00:34:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Anyway. But I was so excited, you know, I feel your excitement in this. And I think the same thing as your keen in on is what makes me excited is because it's really something that if I can get the marketing right, this can make a good, good, like another stream of income for my family, you know, if I could just make, you know, 10 sales a month, , that's, that's an extra, you know, 120,000 a year.
00:34:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm really happy with that. You then have a massively targeted list of potential other things that you could offer them. So now you're not going to know what their test results or whatever.
00:34:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What is that? No, is one of the things that, yeah, I wanted to sell because the one of the. The big things, if people take a test step six months and nine months, if they sleep better, you can easily see their skin improves.
00:35:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that was one of the things I was going to key in on, was like, um, what are we talking about when we first started talking and talked about naps and Steve and all that stuff.
00:35:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What?
00:35:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah, having like a list of people willing to, willing to pay money to improve their brain. mean, yeah, I think well, a significant amount of money and also there's, there's more to it than that. So you might have people who are willing to pay money and invest in their health, but this avatar is scientifically minded. This avatar is not just about health improvement, but this guaranteed is going to be about life quality and longevity. And that's a whole new level up here. Okay, right? That's not the person who's like maybe trying to cut sugar. out of their diet or be on a diet or whatever. This is the person that is like this is serious, this is important and so I don't know how much you studied marketing but if you were to study direct response there's a guy named Eugene Schwartz and he what's it called breakthrough advertising. You would do really well to study it that book is dense it's owned by one of my clients actually so Jean is referenced so many times. He talks about levels of awareness so you've got the I know nothing about whatever you're selling market all the way up to I know everything I'm just looking for the thing to buy. There's like seven levels of awareness and if you get to the point where somebody has bought this their level of awareness of brain health of what is needed. How do you avoid amyloid plaque and not get Alzheimer's? How do you, like, could you as an affiliate offer have some sort of brain training program and software that you create by yourself that helps prevent Alzheimer's? Like, there's so many different things, and if we're looking at you being in this business and having the compounding effect of additional revenue streams where you're, it's scalable and you're not doing it for your time. This has long tentacles out into the future that, and you can build it, and then somebody would probably go buy it from you for, like, $20, $30 million if you were smart about it because you're disrupting right now, nobody's doing this.
00:37:45 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's fair. Alzheimer's is a great thing. This is actually one of the first campaigns that I wanted to run was actually run a campaign for Alzheimer's.
00:37:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, what if you, so have you heard that ultrasound waves are now able to... to break up amyloid plaque and that is the first thing that they've ever found that can reverse Alzheimer's. Yeah, there's been no way to get rid of amyloid plaque until now ultrasound, which makes sense that that could do that, but that it could safely do it.
00:38:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Interesting.
00:38:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm also a medical nerd. study a lot. Health and longevity is a huge thing to me, so I like working with you.
00:38:34 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It's good.
00:38:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can't tell I'm excited in my brain lights up about this, but anyway, if you found a service like that that you could also offer as concierge or make referrals or something like that, you already have the market. Oh, your scan came back with. And so because of HIPAA, you're not going to know anything, but what you can do is say, hey, you know, if you get results like this, here's what you can do. If you get results like this, here's what you can do. Now, HIPAA doesn't allow you to like ask questions per se or whatever or know the information, but they can self-select and I'm interested in this. So you have cause and effect. They select this, therefore, you know, probably assume the correlation and now you start marketing to them this type of thing. And then we get into email hygiene and how much better that makes your inbox, placement and all kinds of other things because you're super segmented and.
00:39:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And I guess that's why like I and that's the tough thing right now and I wanted to kind of get into too about like, you know, my time balance because, you know, we have we have something good going in July. And, you know, that's why like, you know, much how much my time should I be putting in July to kind of really pump, you know, pump my July business. We have the Q and is, you know, that we're making some changes to be more efficient on, you know, I guess, is this now a, you know, is this a good thing to really go after the delta, you know, I call it delta.
00:40:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll tell you my overall strategy for everybody. And first of all, business 101, the verification. Your best bet at success is multiple types of things going on. So the first thought that I just had when you went back to July medical is, you know what, that's probably the way to build the funds to, you know, make sure that you've got everything that you need over here to invest in some marketing, to invest in some good advertising. Because if you're not, if you're going to do this, do it, do it right. Yeah.
00:40:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And it's not a, you mean delta?
00:40:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Okay. Yeah. But the other thing was I was like, well, maybe that just takes off the bumpers off of July medical, and you grow as big as you want to. And then somebody gets attention. and then and pulls you down. You're like, okay, bye done. But the insurance take care of its job of the liabilities and whatever happened to you and be like, okay, pull the plug on that. Moving on, thank you for the signal universe.
00:41:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Goodbye. Yeah. Yeah, and it's kind of just and you said that too, because we're, you know, I'm looking at the total amount of AR that we have and we just passed $5 million in AR, which is about one point, you know, if we get a 25% return, that's close to that's close to 1.5 million. So I think if we keep even just at this level, we're accumulating AR at about about three million, four million a year, just at this current level. So yeah, it's a good point that, you know, even in five years, if I get pulled down by insurance, I'm going to have accumulated, you know, close to 30 million in AR probably by then.
00:41:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, not only that, you now have some assets, you have doctor referrals, you could pretend actually sell something, have some sort of asset that is sellable, so maybe it's not the entity, but maybe it's the contacts, maybe it's the business relationship, and if you go and tell all these people that are referring to you and you go really vet the person, so somebody buys your business from you, which isn't really a business anymore, right? Because they have to do their own name, whatever. But what they're buying is the insertion into your network, and this person will be so vetted by you that you go make a personal recommendation to all of these people, hey, this person's gonna take care of you, I'm trying them on this, this, this, this, and this, but you actually don't really even need the reputation anymore out of integrity, you would do a good job, but let's say they didn't, let's say you vetted them wrong, if that bridge is burned, you've got all these other things going on anyway. That's a good question.
00:42:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What?
00:42:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good point. Yeah. Yeah. and that's the thing that You want, it's not invincibility, but it's, you want to be shielded from whatever can go wrong or if you're making the risk, it's a educated and it's an educated risk where you're, you've got everything coming. So you've got Delta when you've got QME and, well, no, I know, but I'm at July goes.
00:43:29 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah.
00:43:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, yeah. So, and I'm sure that other things are going to present themselves, um, as you, as you, as you go.
00:43:42 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I like that.
00:43:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, especially with whatever related to, like, if you get into the ultrasound stuff for, for Alzheimer's, first of all, that information needs to be so much more widely spread because it's such a big deal, like we lose people. Um, New, but the knowledge and the science behind it for the most part isn't new. It's just we found the missing piece and nobody knows about it yet. And it needs traction. And the other thing that we know is that government, health care, pharmaceuticals, whatever, we're going to do their best to keep that down because drugs are big money, sick people are big money. So you've got these two different competing markets. You have a great way to to to to I don't serve and leverage in there.
00:45:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, we actually hope that this, you know, this price point, we can actually lower it in the coming years. We think that the MRI bills will be lower next year, you know, just because every year the price seems to come down a little. So hopefully this, you know, we'll start to be able to offer this at like $2,000, for instance, every year. So like you're saying, hopefully this diagnostic piece will get cheaper every year. And then, you know, you pair that with the technology like treatment, like all just sound, that'd be really cool.
00:46:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And can they use like a health savings account for this?
00:46:09 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I have to apply through government, but yes, you have to get a tag.
00:46:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the two things I would try to do would be to get that as quickly as possible. Because you want to remove friction from anybody who wants it as much as possible. So they can use, especially because entrepreneurial type people, if they don't have the insurance, we'll have HSA's because this probably wouldn't cover it in most insurance anyway, depending on what kind of diagnosis they had to begin with. And then the other thing is a payment plan. So there are lots of different services that you could sign up for that would give you a payment plan. And those two things right there are going to help remove some friction points right away. And then the other thing about a higher price point is that it allows you to offer like referral discounts. So refer a friend and you know, they say $500 or you say $500 on your next one or that type of thing. And you still preserve solid margins, but you know, that's the whole thing about marketing. They have the feeling that they've saved money. And the fact that they can't go get it anywhere else serves you a very good purpose right there.
00:47:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. I like that. Yeah, I just asked Chat TPT to show me how to register my business to accept HSA after spending, like for Christmas time, that might be a good thing.
00:47:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
of year. Yeah, I love that. And do you have targets? So you should talk to Mark and see if he thinks that you and Dan might be a good match. Dan doesn't just take everybody really what he does is he builds the websites. And the reason for that is because the speed, he needs to control the assets so that we can get really clean data. And that's, he built this whole thing for that purpose because it's really hard to get accurate tracking, but ads don't work very well if you don't have accurate tracking. So, he does that and he just likes puzzles and he, but he's very good at running Google ads in a way that almost nobody does. It's very low cost. So, anyway, it's interesting like when I first told Mark about this business, I actually, because you see how much I can afford to spend on this.
00:48:33 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I was actually, I actually went to Mark and said, know, should I hire someone to do my website, hire someone to do my marketing. And I thought Mark was going to say like, yes, yes, and he actually made me think about it a little differently that like, what is your business really? And so this business to me was like, it's really just a marketing play, right? I'm not, I don't own the brain scanner. don't own the game. the report maker, the brain key report maker, I'm just the reseller. And Mark was saying, you know, you should have at least a beginning understanding of how to create a website, create a payment processor, and also how to, you know, run a base Google ads because he's like, he was telling me like, he can't tell me how many millions he's freelessly spent on. That's exactly why right there. And he said, like, once you, you know, once I figure it out, when I run a couple campaigns, then I can go out and hire, you know, really cool people. But he's like, you need to understand the core of your business. And I was like, okay, so yeah, that was actually that was my plan is to actually run, you know, one campaign, maybe put $10,000 in it and run it on Alzheimer's.
00:49:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so I understand. You know, want to tell that was funny.
00:49:51 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, so that's not even that.
00:49:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's why I wouldn't recommend anybody but Dan. And he is not the best. at creating the campaigns. He is the smartest when it comes to conserving money. The thing about all advertising agencies are they are, you will bleed out the jugular.
00:50:13 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's how bad they are.
00:50:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Mark is right because when you understand the technicality of what's involved and they want to give you a $10,000 a month fee, you're going like for what? For why? No. Now if you want $10,000 and you got me a million dollars. Okay. Right. Or you know what I mean? Or even $100,000. 10% marketing fee is totally accessible. But most of them are just ridiculously priced and you have no concept of it. Most people have no concept of it because they've never done it. So now you have, and Mark would tell you if he thinks it's, I would be curious to know what he thinks.
00:50:52 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I haven't run the campaign yet. I'm probably going to try to do that next week.
00:50:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yes, you should. that everybody that does business for themselves should know a little bit about all the things really should. And the reason I have the business I have is because I did all the things. I've done graphics, I've done web design, I've done programming, I've done building the products, I've taught, I've done all the things. And so when I go with somebody, what's that?
00:51:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, hold on. I was saying, yeah, I think that's a great idea to talk to some of Mark's contacts. Once I run my first campaign to try it, I like it.
00:51:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we keep kidding.
00:51:36 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Like, it keeps coming out and I don't know if it's my internet or yours. Oh, I think I need to stop the share here. There we go.
00:51:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so, I mean, okay, we're almost out of time. I want to make sure that we use whatever and cover whatever you want. But what I, you have other businesses, let me go to my notes, because I would, wanted numbers on everything, even Esther's businesses, if you want. would love to look, because here was the main goal, right? How do we double your revenue without really increasing your time and your workload? So that answer is always leverage and optimization. And the more things that you have that we could leverage and optimize, the easier it is to double without increasing your workload too much. So you have multiple things that could be leveraged. I would love to see the stats in a spreadsheet that I can look at with you on everything. So what we had talked about last week is anything that you could consider a KPI, right? So any revenue coming in, any expenses, where the revenue comes from, any kind of delineation that you can make between the numbers in terms of hours work to fulfill it, staff to fulfill it, at marketing sources and revenues, different price points, whatever it is between all the things we want to document the historical data, then analyze it together and formulate a plan for a small increase across the board with each of those things. then I'm pretty sure that if and then probably like I said take a few weeks because first you've got to get all the data, then we've got to analyze it, then we have to come up with a plan and then we have to see how the plan works. So it's not an immediate thing. So the sooner you sit down and capture this stuff, so that's the penalty for you is you don't have to worry about sending me money, you're not going to be making what you could be making probably pretty easily if I can't see those numbers and we don't go through this exercise. So I'll just let you sit with your losing money by wasting money, leaving it on the table. If I'm not doing the work, that's really all I have. don't have anything, any other questions other than when you get that data. So the other thing that I will tell you is once I see it all, I'm going to ask you to show me where you got it from and kind of prove that those are the real numbers and that's the accountability part. So you told me that you will answer things sometimes incorrectly according to what you think wants to be heard and I'm going to hold you to proving it. So I'm just letting you know I had a time. But the other thing is then I get to see how organized the data is, how necessarily reliable it is, what the potential is for managing it, what for growth and just kind of look over your systems because if they're efficient then they're If they're okay again not doing well, then we'll talk about that the Francis like July will you say me what you want because like I Collected the app like the P&L's and the profit and losses um, is that something that we that I should we because I can ask my bookkeepers for any kind of numbers and they can give me reports on them If if I know what to ask them So those are kind of things that you want me to start getting or like, uh, what kind of KPIs Let's start with P&L's for any business that you have and I would like them for the year and like total but then quarter by quarter. We won't go month to month and that will give us some starting things So just bring the raw data To our meeting we will dig through it on the meeting. It will be slow and it will be tedious These next few weeks are probably just kind of not be as fun as an exciting And I just want you to focus on the delayed gratification for a bit while we gather this because the planning that comes from this is really exciting.
00:56:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, so maybe I'll just target July. So because now for July, I have quarter one and quarter two. I actually wait, are we done with quarter? So two quarters of data. So we can look at that.
00:56:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we'll be almost done.
00:56:29 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, so I can get the monthly P&Ls and then you wanted quarterly P&Ls. Yes. Okay, maybe we'll start.
00:56:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want the whole year and then I want quarterly. Well, July, I would like monthly.
00:56:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, so I'll get it since January and then we can go over those next call.
00:56:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That sounds good. So, physician, physician, oh my God. Physician recruitment, why my tongue does not want to work. Um. I want to know, um, let me see how much you've given me already. I want to understand. Entry the exit for your money, like how do you earn the money? You've told me some about it, but I want to know what that if there's any leverage point, if there's anything that you can do to increase that, let me, let me start with that. Do you think that there's anything that you can do to increase that?
00:57:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay.
00:57:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can talk about ester stuff if you want to medical director. I want to understand deeply like, explain what that is and how the money comes to you. And then also we talked about your training. Um, Q and D like test prep, I think is what it was. And, um, we started getting data on that. And what I. I had asked for was, I wanted one spreadsheet that had the overall snapshot kind of data for each of those businesses, which is the revenue month over month, as long as you've been doing that particular business, and that would incite questions for me that I can start asking you, but I really need to be able to see that revenue and know a little bit in terms of like where it comes from. So the assignment and I would like to install the there's a repercussions for not doing it next week, because it would be a waste of our time if you don't have this we're we shouldn't it should have already been done. Is that I want that and I need to make sure that you're clear because I did ask for it before. And you can tell me if you get too busy or something like that, but I want revenue for every type of the business, so you gave me I'll just list them one more time. All right. right. All right. right. All right. All Physician Recruitment, Medical Director, and the licensing exam test prep. I want to know the revenue month over month from each of those, a description in the same spreadsheet of how you make that money. What do you have to do to get it and any kind of information that you can think of as to what you might be able to do to increase it? All of those before we meet next week and I want it, we're meeting Monday. I want to Friday. It's Friday. Wait, wait. It's Thursday. Okay. That's not fair. You're lucky. All right, you can have it by Monday morning and we'll just go into by then because I wanted to go over it, but I'm not going to work on the weekends. I got the girls this weekend, so we'll just do it Monday. So if you're prepared with all of that, then we will have a good day.
01:00:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
call. Oh, sounds great.
01:00:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:00:03 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Should I keep putting time into this delta thing? Or do I need to put that on the back word?
01:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Does it light you up?
01:00:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I really like doing it. But you know, I see the money that I can make with July like we talked about and refinements to the QME. I could be better at that.
01:00:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So here's the thing about creators and visionaries. We don't usually stay on one thing really well for long without feeling frustrated, annoyed, irritated. You have to have some freedom to go other places. These are existing businesses that you've already defined and chosen. Now, if you want to say you want to go chase something else that isn't even on your plate when you've got all these things going on, like what are you doing? Stop. Focus. But it's already here that you're already doing it. nurturing it would be good. once we get to the activity, that I'm talking about and we have evaluated all of your income strains and then chosen which ones have the most leverage and then made a plan for it. Then you need to try to stay within the bounds that we've created but those boundaries don't exist right now so you know and we don't have any reason or logical placement to put boundaries in so if you've got time and you're not neglecting other duties then then explore it but you should be mindful of you know sleep routine and hygiene and family that's the only thing I would always say no matter what we're talking about. That's fair all right that's good and dirty all right it was awesome talking to you foodie hello Esther I know it's your time but I really like that and makes me happy so thanks for letting us say hi. Yes you're great all right thank you.
01:01:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay bye have a great night.

Can you hear me? Yeah. So did you said to say hi?
00:00:08 - mark sweet
Yeah, they are COVID. So he's having fun.
00:00:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what he said.
00:00:12 - mark sweet
Well, everybody but him. For now, you know how that goes. We know where this is going.
00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. He is awesome.
00:00:23 - mark sweet
Yeah. Yeah.
00:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Thank you for that. If Dr. B is anything like that, then I would really love to do that. No, no, no.
00:00:32 - mark sweet
No, I wish. But now.
00:00:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi, Dan. Hey.
00:00:41 - mark sweet
Hey. Okay. Before we jump into a bunch of stuff, I just want to get some clarification on a couple of things before I forget. Okay. This is more Dan related than anything else. Okay. Valiant, TRG, et cetera, et cetera leads. Those are now no longer going to HQ intake, right?
00:00:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. And after they are no longer going there. Okay. Yeah, so only thing going there now are like. I can confirm this, but it's like 50% roughly of. One of five. And then, and then leads, and then leads when they're 96 hours old.
00:01:24 - mark sweet
Okay.
00:01:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Which we could turn off.
00:01:27 - mark sweet
Yeah, the quantified there still getting the same content information we are. So we had the scene where we're both calling the same person again.
00:01:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know how that's happening. They're saying that. They're only sending them to us. So. Stend over like the most recent emails of those people because we'll have to trace. The zaps and the automations and see if there's something, something must be up somewhere. or quantifies some of us still sending them there, but they said they weren't. I mean, I saw her response and she said, she's only sending them to us.
00:02:11 - mark sweet
Yeah, you know, SEC, Eric, too, we're just you.
00:02:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:02:18 - mark sweet
It's just, it's creating some friction and knowing that we're going to be pulling some leads. I don't want create more friction. Yeah. So if we have to just switch all quantified just to them, so be it.
00:02:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Sure.
00:02:32 - mark sweet
But the quantified cost per lead is shockingly low, like solid. There's some issues we got with some clients who were like, oh, I thought I was doing something else and I don't want to move forward, but that just happens. But again, given the amount.
00:02:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They convert.
00:02:55 - mark sweet
They convert and their cost per position is low. So now it's like doing also one. And now try the Utah thing again and with just them.
00:03:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That would be a good way to start.
00:03:08 - mark sweet
Right, because we already now have it where the Utah do this before that's just signing cases. Right. And that was their big issue.
00:03:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:03:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Chocker.
00:03:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's not cool. He can do it.
00:03:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, oh, really do.
00:03:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Really? Come on.
00:03:27 - mark sweet
Well, yeah, so I might try to do that because I don't think it's going to cost me more than a couple of grand a month.
00:03:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. And it can just sort of seed that pipeline at least get, right? Because the next thing is, how does that dude handle a case, right? unfortunately, you're not going to be able to see how he manages it. But here's the benefit. It's Salko's thing. So if it doesn't go bad, you know who's going to freak out. It doesn't go good.
00:04:01 - mark sweet
I mean, he'll lose his , which is perfect Because I'm wondering if we should just switch back and just have HQ intake just Oh, and then just do all quantify including Utah yeah, and that way there's not I mean, I don't they seem to do particularly well with those leaves.
00:04:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't get it But that is Certainly the way it looks right.
00:04:36 - mark sweet
I'm sure if we dove into the map it would back it up Right.
00:04:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't understand it, but it is what it is Right, and some things don't need to be fully understood I mean, that's that's a simple fix. mean then we don't even need to figure out what's wrong Yeah, we should do that Texting her grin Well, we're actually Stacy. I can't sit at air because I mean, we get lost, but I know he's not super busy, so.
00:05:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So will HQN take be doing any other leads?
00:05:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They do the 96 hour old leads.
00:05:24 - mark sweet
And the Sunday leads?
00:05:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, they still got leads.
00:05:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's that volume?
00:05:37 - mark sweet
Sunday?
00:05:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and they're core.
00:05:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The 96. Yeah, the 96 has even been on a week. So it's hard to say. It used to be 72, but there's no point. We can't really go back and figure it out. So, we'd have to look at it going forward. forward and I don't know what it will be, but when they send over a report, if we look at when the 96 got turned on, I'll confirm with Eric, then it will be, you know, well, I guess, if we make this change today, so we'll have to use today as the date, or the date when Eric says, so hopefully it would technically be probably tomorrow. So if he makes up the today, tomorrow becomes quantifiable and 96, then, and Sunday, if we wait a week, pretty much whatever that number is next week is probably the number other than adding a Utah, which may or may not happen this week, but it'll be in the neighborhood. so who is the attorney for Utah?
00:06:59 - mark sweet
No, it's his name. I don't know if I'm top of my head.
00:07:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Not me either. Saka's buddy.
00:07:06 - mark sweet
Yeah.
00:07:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Machine comes up as So good name. Saka's buddy.
00:07:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I don't. Oh, yeah, we did.
00:07:16 - mark sweet
Okay. So he started. I want to say it's Brad.
00:07:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This.
00:07:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, great.
00:07:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I forgot about that. Yeah. haven't talked about it, but I, you started in like December, right? Somewhere around there.
00:07:34 - mark sweet
Yeah. was very bad.
00:07:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How's it going now?
00:07:39 - mark sweet
Like, I don't see. We stopped because it was very, very, very bad.
00:07:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:07:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what's changed that we're going to be doing this now?
00:07:50 - mark sweet
Okay. Now he lets us sign for him. The issue before was he wasn't picking up. the phone, they weren't good on intake. They weren't good on intake.
00:08:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:08:08 - mark sweet
And so now we're able to walk around that issue, I guess, for lack of letter term, if we can just sign it up and if it drops it, it is what it is. The only sign like one or two cases, I haven't heard anything about how they're going. I'll be lucky if I break it even on those.
00:08:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then what is the purpose of being there?
00:08:32 - mark sweet
Because we spent 17,000 with Walker, quantified it significantly cheaper.
00:08:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So was break even, but now you think it could be profitable?
00:08:46 - mark sweet
If we only sign, but you might be break even. Right. But here, we're like under two granted case.
00:08:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:08:58 - mark sweet
So. If again, better.
00:09:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I'm looking at that. got to refresh this report. The Dan DD intake. Dashboard. Okay.
00:09:24 - mark sweet
He goes to quantify or something. Smaller ones work. This is a way we can expand it more. He's back. Yeah.
00:09:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which one is quantified?
00:09:40 - mark sweet
Is that blue steel?
00:09:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Well, speaking of Actually, sorry, Mark, were you, did you discuss other things that you wanted to get to first?
00:09:53 - mark sweet
That was kind of the main thing.
00:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So. Um, report updates. Dan, do we have any?
00:10:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's a Stacy question. So she, she sent over the stuff that you sent. So probably not.
00:10:12 - mark sweet
mean, so she sent it over.
00:10:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. finished all the others. All the other stuff was done, but the stuff that you that we came up with last Monday, have not, he hasn't, he hasn't updated us on that. So there's probably no update.
00:10:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. All right. Um, let's go look at this. Oh, yeah. That was my. Oh, no, haven't met with. So, okay. I'm meeting with Lauren's Wednesday. Um, and, but I talked to you Thursday instead of Monday. So, okay. I don't have anything new to report there, obviously.
00:10:54 - mark sweet

Although he did tell me that like, he said that. Look at what he said. I should hit him up.
00:11:27 - mark sweet
He's running the same issue. more buddies. Like he would like to send me cases. He just doesn't have a lot coming through.
00:11:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. And but I can't remember if he knew whether or not they already had a lawyer or it was too late.
00:11:45 - mark sweet
I wonder if we should.
00:11:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Wonder if we should look at his stuff and be like. What are the issues. Like, hey, what is the status, right? car accident, right? Obviously would. Look at the ones that were car accident and then say, okay, have a lawyer, don't have a lawyer, have a lawyer, obviously, we'd be like, I'm just I know you. And then the other one would be don't have a lawyer. And then is it too late? It's probably the case is what, but I don't know. And what are the odds he's collecting all this data? I'll let him buy me some beer and then tell him how to run this business.
00:12:32 - mark sweet
He said he turned everything AI in his office. So you're not even a front desk person anymore.
00:12:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Nice. Yeah.
00:12:43 - mark sweet
It's interesting.
00:12:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The ads are the automation. How's that going? All We're going to do.
00:13:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Do that? don't know if we were actually doing that.
00:13:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are we not?
00:13:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know. I don't remember if we said to do it, but if we are, it's going to go. We're going to do it. Eric's back. So Eric was on the town. So I'll queue it up. We probably put that live today too.
00:13:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Would there be any reason we would not do that?
00:13:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't remember. I don't remember talking about it. I was like, he asked me. Are we doing it?
00:13:29 - mark sweet
go, I don't think we talked about it.
00:13:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Anywho.
00:13:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so that was still.
00:13:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We are doing it, apparently. I don't remember saying we were doing it. I remember pitching it, but then I was like, Oh, it was pitched and approved.
00:13:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My notes say Dan can create an automation that is the answer of the automation and see what happens. No. No. Let's see. So that we can now intake and close. I certainly can close.
00:13:58 - mark sweet
I think her issue was.
00:14:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
early when each doing take wasn't good oh yeah so we killed that that got killed on Friday too so we can now make one because all ads certainly leads as of Saturday well other than Sunday right there's still that Sunday thing but the vast majority of ads certainly leads we can now segment into their own automation we'll do that three calls in an hour yada yada yada and then they're gonna they're like they want to get out of washington they're like you guys for whatever reason washington isn't working but new mexico is so they're like we're gonna focus more on new mexico's and that's fine i'm not really hmm i'll have some with it you talk well we don't need that now no no no don't don't yeah i'm not just like just we to try to make some side money basically i don't want to be a mean focus yeah if we've got any that are very cost efficient for lower volume which is what we're seeing
00:15:04 - mark sweet
Yeah.
00:15:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where is the doctor report?
00:15:09 - mark sweet
Was it America that's working on it? Yeah, you should be sure it on it.
00:15:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, I'm going with share with me. I wish I know I've seen it, but I don't. I got to start it so I can. Do you know what it's called? No.
00:15:37 - mark sweet
I would assume like doctor map or something.
00:15:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I just looked up doctors and share with me.
00:15:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I swear Google Drive sucks when you search for stuff.
00:15:46 - mark sweet
Yeah, it really holds. It's list. 2023 to present.
00:15:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. It's cool.
00:15:55 - mark sweet
Drive definitely needs a little more.
00:16:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so let me send you an email asking you, or I can ask you, and America, I don't know. But I would like to see that and then I'm just going to bookmark it make sure it's in a place where I can see it all the time. See Mark. Mark.
00:16:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I can't find it either.
00:16:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You want to CC America just sent you.
00:16:42 - mark sweet
I'm going to give her control that part. What's her email should pop up that America.
00:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get is the American now lines coming up. Okay. I'm very different. Yeah.
00:17:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Eric looked at that that you sent over and they got sent to each cube because. The 96 hours it expired. So there's got to be. We have to look at it like we need to figure out a way to know for sure. Either they both hit and contact the person on the same day.
00:17:43 - mark sweet
But like we signed her before.
00:17:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. So that means we need some sort of. So why didn't we see it as them being in contact? There's something we have to figure out. It should. a band that they were in pending contact or and then they didn't advance so we just need to figure out a way to go oh we're talking to them right um that should be pretty it's pretty cool i mean anything else i'm pending contact yeah i think a lot of times they just leave a person in pending contact but well we can let me look at it and then we can yeah what looks at it what was that i was reading i was sending up that emo who's the eric looked eric looked at that thing that even though we don't well we still need it for the 96 hours but the one that mark was like hey they double contact with them we figured out it's because it got sent to them but it technically should know but the question is how do we stop that in the future but i'll bet they're all like that yep yeah so it's like um We just got to find a signal we can use.
00:19:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So is the error happening on a technology level or an intake level?
00:19:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like people, yeah, it's a people, yeah. So process, it's like a process issue, right?
00:19:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how are you solving that?
00:19:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know yet.
00:19:29 - mark sweet
I'm going to talk to you about making sure that we're only leaving pending contact when we haven't talked to them.
00:19:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So Eric is saying that that's what's happening. They are leaving them in pending contact. So we just got to, I'll double check it all, but then it just might be, hey, if you're working a lead, you got to move it over and then it would be 96, then we'd come up with the different rules. So it'd be 96 hours in pending and then from working, but maybe we're not.
00:20:00 - mark sweet
we never move them. Yeah, as long as it's working, then we don't need to move it because that means we've gotten.
00:20:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. He's saying that's the problem. They are not moving it.
00:20:10 - mark sweet
Okay, I will talk calling people that your entity team is already working with because of this. Okay, got it. And so they're like, well, she's not there.
00:20:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. um, No, I ran it down. So Patty's back from vacation. She hasn't left with the baby yet. When she leaves, it's going to be six months. I don't think that I wrote down when she's leaving.
00:21:03 - mark sweet
Two weeks.
00:21:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the same thing. Okay. When that's that. Like 24 or something.
00:21:17 - mark sweet
Basically, I'm on.
00:21:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Another month. Okay. So, um, did you guys work on the intake script?
00:21:28 - mark sweet
And we're going to meet today to go through it a little bit more.
00:21:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's the level of progress? Do you think out of like?
00:21:45 - mark sweet
closer. I just, they have the basics of the script. I just want to work on our. Objections, I guess.
00:21:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's important. Good afternoon. Anything that's a friction point should, like, you want to thoroughly, basically create as many guardrails as possible that your team can recognize, oh, this is the friction point, this is the trigger, therefore this is the response or the way that I need to handle it, and then, like, if they're not really good at doing it consistently, maybe some type of role play activity, because call control and call flow is, you can't script everything, but that practice and that immediate feedback of, okay, this is how you should handle that, this is how you should handle that, creates this muscle memory, but also creates confidence that they may not. don't have in dealing with something, because there's so many different things to process, the person on the other end, energy, their tone, what experience they had, your person, the mood that they're in, all these different things. So you want to try to make things as reflexive as possible where they don't even have to think about it. They know how to recognize this situation gets this response so that it just becomes habit and reflex. But you want everybody to have the same reflexes and obviously there's a, there's skill, you know, there won't be perfect consistency across the board, but it can be engineered to be probably a lot better, but I haven't listened to the calls. I actually keep reminding myself to do that. have to log into lead flow, but I don't have a lead flow rate access yet, I think. is my issue. Hold on a second, let me check. Dan, that's what it's called, right? Lead slowly, that's what I would look at, login security code. I did get that. Okay, I care to login. Okay, so that's what I want to do so that I can kind of add some feedback to that. Because managing call flow is something I've had lot of training and experience and it's been a long time in the corporate world, but it all, it's all the same for the most part.
00:24:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay, it is all the same.
00:24:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, people being people. Okay, you guys are working on that. Do you have anybody on the NTA team that, I mean, when's last time you listened to NTA calls?
00:24:54 - mark sweet
Well, I mean, I'll go and sit and listen to them, but to actually like to sit and go through the recording step by step is going to walk.
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wanna buy a while? Six months. Okay, that's not that bad.
00:25:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's been a year for me.
00:25:13 - mark sweet
Because it was like December, January that I got ticked off and that's where it's been about six months. Right. when it comes to my digging instead.
00:25:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me go back. Where do I have the intake team written down? Used.
00:25:30 - mark sweet
Oh, so just the sort of an FYI will pass these out. splitting our role in two.
00:25:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you told us that last week. I got that.
00:25:40 - mark sweet
Feel comfortable with that at least.
00:25:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is good. Between I wrote it down, I just looked at it. So, but yeah. Um, so who, who, oh, I'm Maria Mia. Who is there anybody else besides those, those two want to take?
00:26:07 - mark sweet
That are going to be running it now.
00:26:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So they're running it for her. Okay.
00:26:15 - mark sweet
think we had a Zavato Marco, Jalissa Jose.
00:26:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What was the first name before Marco?
00:26:27 - mark sweet
A Zavato?
00:26:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A Zavato? Okay. And. How long? Let me see because I'm going to just go put this in my spreadsheet with the firm. Name this. This intake. How long has each one done working with you? Yeah.
00:26:54 - mark sweet
Uh, me has got to be on like here. Three or four at this point. Maria has been with us for at least a year. She's the only one with a college degree and she's a very detailed specific, so she's going to be good at breathing the biles. Jelissa's been with us for about a year and a half, she's going to law school next year. Jose has been with us for eight months, I think. Marco's been with us for close to a year. Is all those new? think he's on month three.
00:27:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, let's see. Marco was how long. As well, though. One three, you said.
00:27:53 - mark sweet
Yeah. Yeah, he knew.
00:28:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then Patty, and stay one. Right.
00:28:08 - mark sweet
No.
00:28:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No.
00:28:14 - mark sweet
She's been around since 2019.
00:28:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, let's see what's. So, I know when I last updated this. If you can rank them. Scale one to 10. How would you write each of them? One being the worst.
00:28:45 - mark sweet
Yep. or anything specific.
00:28:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, we could, we could write them according to certain data types. If that would mean the more information I have about them, the better. And the more ways that you're. evaluating them and looking at them the better.
00:29:03 - mark sweet
Yeah, so let's use Jose because he's kind of the most polarizing one. Okay, he's very good at closing on the phone, but he is not reliable, not detail oriented, and can't rely a lot. The next one, let's go to Jalissa. She's smart, but she's just here for a paycheck now and she's going to law school. So she does her job, she doesn't do anything beyond her job. She's mid-level, I guess I would say. She understands what to ask and kind of understands what clients are doing, but not around for a long time so she knows what she's looking for and she's developing a pretty good gut of like what cases to take which ones not to take which is good. Still needs work to help though on closing cases. Azvaldo is new so he's still just trying to make sure he figures out you know what we're doing. Not a slight on him it just takes time of course. But he wants to learn he wants to listen to calls so he's you're going learn to get better. Marco is like a B plus decently on closing cases could be a little bit more aggressive on the phone and a little bit of a lack of detail. And then Patsy I think we kind of all know where she's at. Again I think she's a little weak on closing cases but she's pretty good on what's taking what not to do. And then Maria is only one I forgot. Maria is very detail-orienting, weak on the phone or weaker on the phone, I should say. She's much more about order taker.
00:31:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Now you know who's calls to listen to Tina, and in what order? Although, actually, you can't tell who's remembering.
00:31:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You to learn their voices. I'm pretty good at that. Let's see. Okay, so you gave me those details, which are really great, but now I would like you just to write them overall scale of one to 10. Go Patsy first. Let's give her a seven. Maria.
00:32:00 - mark sweet
Five.
00:32:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:32:04 - mark sweet
Six.
00:32:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Jelissa. Five. Jose.
00:32:15 - mark sweet
He's anywhere between the two and a thing.
00:32:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I really do. think on the day.
00:32:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know.
00:32:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
depends if he's had a snack or not.
00:32:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my god. Does he show up You might want to include that information. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Part is to replace and take people by the way that we've had this conversation but it's been a while.
00:32:53 - mark sweet
They get burned out.
00:32:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
really don't want to do it. Yeah. Okay. Marco. Hello.
00:33:02 - mark sweet
Marco, I would say six and a half.
00:33:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, although it's still new, but let's rank him as a newbie. As far as like previous new people.
00:33:20 - mark sweet
I mean, if I got to just put him on a scale, I put him at a, you know, a four. I think knowing that he's new, I would put him closer to, you know, the sixth, seven range. I think he could be the long term.
00:33:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For six. That's, that's good. No, wait that. Um, whoa. Hate when I click on something and Excel about like disappears. I'll use my place.
00:33:50 - mark sweet
Right. But obviously those are, yeah, some swings there.
00:33:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Okay, I'll just ponder that for a while, because that's the only thing that my brain can do right now, and that would be not a fun conversation, because I wouldn't be talking, I would just be thinking. Okay, I'm going to think about that. Let's see.
00:34:18 - mark sweet
They're highly incentivized at their goals so they're definitely motivated that way, but the one thing I do like about them is, they don't try to twist cases to try to design it just to try to have a goal.
00:34:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good.
00:34:41 - mark sweet
But their incentive is all tied to each other right so it's a team goal because when we try to do individual night, it became problematic of who signed what because look at the people talked to a client. So it just, it was just better to do a team goal. It cuts down on. on the issues significantly.
00:35:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there, and this is just things to contemplate for maybe some kind of separation and reward for individual performance, like even just, and because I have to think about how we can do this, obviously the HR rules and the things that you can specify and can't, but just punctuality, like is there anybody that's chronically late or leaves early or not back from lunch on time, things like that where you can, rather than penalize, just reward people for never being that or that type of Yeah, I honestly don't dig into that as much as I should.
00:35:55 - mark sweet
They're generally there when we're supposed to be within five or 10 minutes. So the only one that we've got issues with this goes in.
00:36:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So do they, they're not salary that early, right?
00:36:19 - mark sweet
So they, they log in. Correct, except pass it.
00:36:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Do you ever look at their login reports?
00:36:29 - mark sweet
No. I mean, they come in, they have to scan their thumb. So I know when they're here, but, you know.
00:36:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you've never reviewed their login reports.
00:36:39 - mark sweet
Only if there's an issue, then you should bring it up to me. And Patsy is pretty good at telling it that someone's got an issue.
00:36:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then do they stay in the same state all day? it just either like a time card like you're here? And not here, or do they have break periods where they, um, um. Like if they're going to lunch, do they log out for lunch? What's that with like?
00:37:04 - mark sweet
Yeah, no, it's regular hourly. So at the end, clock out for lunch, come back, clock back in, 14 minutes.
00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And paid breaks are not a separate anything. It's just going break and tell somebody, like, how does that work, too, for breaks?
00:37:21 - mark sweet
They just have their 10 minute breaks.
00:37:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And nobody's looking to see if 10 minute breaks turn into 30 minute breaks or 40 minute breaks.
00:37:34 - mark sweet
No, again, if there was an issue, well, it's your path to say something to me.
00:37:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I hear that. But I hear about it. Well, and define issue and define does Patsy even want to deal with it? Like, let's say it's, what does it say to me? Hold on, it's the, yeah, it's the drunk. Good. Right.
00:38:01 - mark sweet
That's definitely more than annoyed.
00:38:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so any, but attention to detail and even caring about things, you know, it's, so what gets on path to these radar, for example, is the only thing that's on a radar is, hey, there's calls and nobody's answering them. Now I'm going to look around and see what people are doing, or is she in the habit of looking around and saying what people are doing. So to the point of the quality of team and who's showing up and being active and doing things, especially if they're all getting the same incentive, which totally with that type of behavior seems wildly unfair and demotivating, which is why you have to catch other things that you can reward if you can't separate this type of thing. But, but is, you know like if I show up and I'm on time every single day and I never go over all my breaks or rarely right and I am not abusing time and I'm showing up and I'm doing a good job and maybe I'm not the best person but I try my best and then there's this drunk that comes I gotta watch my mouth but that comes in and he's late and he's belligerent or rude or lying or whatever and like we're all getting the same reward and like nobody cares that he's just screwing around because he does it one more slow so like nobody's noticing but he's just hanging out like I'd be annoyed so um dealing with something because there's an issue is not high level leadership and management do you know what I mean that that's reactive is anybody paying attention and trying to optimize things like just the way people show up and act and and how they punch in and whatnot and I don't know what level you at that to me. It's not micromanaging. It's just understanding. It's inventory, right? Human resources are part of your business. And you've got an entire team of six, seven people here that nobody's paying close attention to. It's passing listening to their calls regularly.
00:40:22 - mark sweet
I got it.
00:40:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so there's like no quality control here in solid leadership or management on team of seven. That's a huge thing. Yeah. So, you know, we're really starting to get a lot of other things. Either under control or we're building a framework around it to to kind of, you know, putting the guardrails, putting the framework in and taking a look at it. intake, from the beginning when we've asked questions, it's just been kind of like like it is what it is, type, answer and response.
00:41:04 - mark sweet
It's hard to find people to work it and not to burn down for sure, but it definitely needs improvement.
00:41:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and I feel like we're at a point now because we go in cycles, right? Where sometimes our calls are super focused on one particular thing and we're fleshing it out and like we end the call and there's still lots of stuff to talk about. And then there's periods where like there's not a ton because it's all getting worked on and this is one of those periods where we've got room to be talking about other things and digging into it a little. It is a frustrating thing and it's going to take some extraction and we're gonna have to work hard to figure out what we can do because of the nature of it. But if you're willing to just kind of wrestle with us a little bit and try to figure out what we can do. I think that it's a critical part of your business and it deserves that effort. Even if it's not clear and there's no clear path, I would like us to be spending a little more time working on it. I do think now is a good time to do it. Now isn't like not just today, but like, you know, maybe for the next few months.
00:42:24 - mark sweet
Yeah, no, I agree.
00:42:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. I think if you get a script in place, right? All the calls I listen to, all of them were way too long because they didn't pre-qualify the person when they got on the call. So burnout. I could see burnout coming from. Oh my God. have to listen to this person recount this accident that has no me, no purpose with me being on the phone. That would drive me nuts. But it's there. it's the process is what's causing that. It's like that that that would get eliminated. So if that's a factor, that fact can get eliminated.
00:43:08 - mark sweet
So somewhat, I mean, they get a lot of abuse, and unfortunately, too, you know, only tell people that we can.
00:43:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah, I see some of comments.
00:43:16 - mark sweet
Yeah, so, you know, that's an unfortunate part of what we do. And that's just that's been ever going to take up in part of like, that's just the nature of the people or else. Sometimes you can't change that.
00:43:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can't, but you can't train and help your team know how to handle that. Has that been done? Like, I know we did black, you have black phones. I don't know how helpful it was with that. And you've also had grief counseling, but what kind of training has your team had in terms of dealing with and redirecting difficult people on the phone?
00:43:59 - mark sweet
Just the black. on stuff. And then again, giving them solutions. You know, I'm sorry, we can't help you, but here's a place you can go to, which is really the state bar website for, you know, from there. So at least try to help them in some way, shape or form of at least to go to.
00:44:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:44:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Maybe you could turn it into a positive and be like, all right, Karen, call it the month award goes to so-and-so. Oh, I got the best one. I got the best . You're like, great, you get a new withstanding money.
00:44:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, we could just get a trophy that I turned that frown upside down.
00:44:50 - mark sweet
Don't use the trophy with a big butt on it or something. Like, you got the, you talk to the forward.
00:44:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Instead of the talking.
00:45:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, there are, there are soft skills.
00:45:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You get the plushy.
00:45:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And our soft skills, sometimes it can be learned and people can be empowered, which is respectful and erupting. And it doesn't always happen. But first of all, it starts with a frame of mind of just knowing, look, this, this is a thing that has to happen and that you're not being rude by coming somebody else, because the whole point of why they called is to get help with what they want. Occasionally, maybe you have somebody calling just because they want to complain and they're angry or they're lonely, I suppose that's possible too, because any type of dealing with the public, you're going to get some of that. But for the most part, the person called because they had a goal to accomplish. And if the intake person keeps that in mind, this person called me because they have a goal in mind. My job is to help them accomplish that goal and also to remind them because they're, they're going to be emotional and they're going to be distracting. did once they start talking about things that they had a goal in mind. Your goal is you got an accident and you want to get help for it. So the problem is the things that you're telling me right now are preventing me from helping you accomplish that goal. So if you don't mind, let me pause you there. I'm going to ask you this question and then oftentimes even belligerent people will be redirected. Now, if you ask them that multiple times, you can empower your people and say, look, sir, I've asked you three times for this. I really need this to be able to help you. If you're not ready to talk about that, I totally understand. How would you call us back when you want to discuss it or something like that? I don't know that you can do that, but my point is that there are things that can be trained and processes and you have to kind of weigh like what's it going to cost you? Obviously, there's a game to play and you can't be just getting rid of any difficult people. But I don't know, and I will listen to some of the calls, which I'm kind of dreading because that's probably going to be hours of time to really go and do that well. But to see what kind of skills they have, are people able to pause, professionally interrupt, redirect, refocus, because from what I've heard from Dan, that probably isn't happening really well. So anyway, just going through this, even if it's again 5%, 10% improvement, and maybe the improvement is not only on how long the calls take, but also reducing stress for your team. If this is a high burnout job, you know, if Sweet Law could be a place where you, people, your intake team is like, I don't want to go work anywhere else because I've been trained this. I've been. empowered to handle calls this particular way. I'm supported by getting a good intake script. We're not overly busy, like we're not just slammed with calls constantly and understaffed so that they can maximize money. Like all these different things that go into it and, you know, looking back a year from now, going, wow, you know, that's just a little bit of improvement, but I noticed it. And here's how it's reflected in the numbers. And here's how it's reflected on the team. And then we start the compounding effect of, you know, now Mia's been here six years and she's even better at this. And when we have to hire somebody new, we've got a better person to train and that type of thing. So it's like everything else. Like it's small, it seems like it's not going to make a big impact. And then you look back and you go, that was helpful. So in a very critical portion of the business. So anyway, I think you should go back and listen to some calls too if you have some downtime just maybe if you could sample a few calls from each person so that you've got something fresh in your head so that we can come back and discuss it would be good what do you think about that yeah no I need to and when do you have time for that time it's just it's one of those you need to make time we need time yeah what I'm asking is because I'd almost rather have a tooth pull and go do that maybe we just end up spending a call doing it together I don't know but um I want to be prepared when you start let's um maybe listen to it on the airplane traveling okay all right um so we'll try to discuss need to And our login report, something that you could share with me.
00:50:14 - mark sweet
Um, I have to, Isaac would be the one who would have to pull those.
00:50:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, let me send you an email and just see, um, I'll see the Isaac. And that way all you have to do is say yes or no. So, okay. Yep. I'm going to make one. Okay. Uh, what, what was that? That came.
00:51:02 - mark sweet
I'm just going to ask a bit of answer.
00:51:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, cool. I played that last. And I'll just shoot this off. All right. Oh, go back and take some files. Morning meditation. Um, Dan, you had something. Yeah. Did you send that to Mark?
00:51:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, no.
00:51:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You want to tell them what it is?
00:51:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yoga nidra. Are you doing yoga nidra? You should try yoga nidra.
00:51:45 - mark sweet
You should try yoga nidra.
00:51:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The yoga nidra, it's not really yoga, but it's a meditation that you do. part of it is that you set an intention, which is interesting. But you're, it's like you got more sleep when you're done with it. It takes 20 minutes and it's a little weird because you're, you're just laying down and it's, it's, um, dive in so they're like, do this. They're basically having you go through your whole body while you're doing it, like focus on different parts of your body. then at the end, it's like they do some at the end or whatever. But when you open your eyes after it, it's, you're altered, you're altered. You're like, whoa, you feel way more energized. It's like getting more sleep. I mean, that's, I picked it up from, um, Andrew Huberman, who's this book in biohacker dude. And he thought, he thought it was BS and then he started doing it. He's like, Oh my God, it's like to make a difference. And I think they studied when they're like, yeah, people are changed by doing it. The ultimate test. though was when our little friend Salco called me and he was like flipping out and he's like, dude, he's complaining about something. go, you need to try yoga, and he's like, what the hell is that? And I explained to him, he's like, I'm not going to do that. And I said, well, then whatever. I'll send it to you anyway. And I said to him, and then three days later, he's like, dude, he was so freaking out about something. He's like, I did it while I was in the So he legged out the airport and didn't, because I felt amazing.
00:53:30 - mark sweet
Like, told you, he also got facing the airport.
00:53:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But yeah, that's the difference. That's the difference. That's called, that's called Drumka Nidra.
00:53:40 - mark sweet
It's different. Yeah, no, I'm looking at my text messages from while in the airport, which are not appropriate for this conversation in any way, shape or form.
00:53:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, this is new.
00:53:50 - mark sweet
Mine was a while ago.
00:53:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, he said he had COVID.
00:53:55 - mark sweet
He's got a COVID hangover. Because this was stampede was here this weekend. There's four groups of six Plus women who would all be quote unquote rodeos.
00:54:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, boy.
00:54:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:54:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I think it was seven is flossing at the table.
00:54:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, lovely.
00:54:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Like literally.
00:54:18 - mark sweet
No. Center for you. There's no rules. You want to drink margarita?
00:54:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
are no rules.
00:54:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. Um, so the point was that we were discussing it, talking about, um, morning, you were talking about morning meditations last week. And so Dan was like, Oh yeah, I've been, I did this thing. He should do this. And so I wanted to remember to see if he told you that.
00:54:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's a joke right now. So one minute.
00:54:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right.
00:54:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
If you don't follow Andrew Huberman, like all of his things. Yeah, he's. Yeah. all of these things are great. Getting up and going out in the sun and doing all that stuff.
00:55:06 - mark sweet
So one of the people I work with told me this and this actually makes a lot of sense that negative emotions are used to avoid your responsibilities. many times someone's like acting out or there's a negative emotion tied to something because they're trying to avoid some kind of responsibility.
00:55:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Sure, that ties in with like the whole self-fulfilling prophecy and concept which is absolutely beautiful.
00:55:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Interesting. I will say though that while I've been working on my psychology degree and it's interesting doing it at this age and the stage in life as a parent and having gone through other things that I've gone through because when I first went to school, you know when you're when you're young, you're institutionalized, you're trained. that the teachers know everything, adults know everything, and that the people that write the books know everything and that they are the and all be all authority. And I know better than that now. So going through school, but what's interesting to me is some of the books have the textbooks have said, look, this is in the book because the book had to be created, but we couldn't even agree on this stuff. It's here because this was the general consensus, but a lot of us disagree. We disagree with the, you know, the main book. Do you see it? Why can't I even think about it right now, my gosh? Anyway, but for every scientist that will tell you one thing, there will be two that disagree with them. And so that is why, too, I think that it's so important that we take the notes and, and I don't know, explore and have our own experience. I've been taking sunshine breaks for like, I don't know, 15 years. It is crazy. I sleep better. get at least 15 minutes of sun. As Fuji already told him, he needs to start writing that down, but it's wild, all of these things. There's more to try and learn than we'll ever even have time to in our lives. But if we can find back to leverage, if we can find the levers that make a significant impact, it doesn't matter if you know all the things and do all the things and we're not disciplined anyway enough to do all the things consistently, but figuring out what our Kryptonites are, what are the things, what are our coping mechanisms, what are our defense mechanisms, what are the things that we use to avoid whatever, kind of paying attention to that and create the system.
00:57:55 - mark sweet
Did I have you read switch, Mark?
00:57:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. You know what I did. pay attention to and I didn't notice that Fuji pointed out today was that that you creating the path so and this is it was just different language but I didn't realize it was in there it's what I do anyway but to the point of like we have finite willpower you can only wrestle with so many things each day so if it's a Russell to get up in the morning at a particular time if it's a wrestle to not check email if it's a wrestle to not snap but somebody that annoys the heck out of you but to wrestle to choose good food choices if it's a wrestle to you know what mean like all these different things that we have to kind of fight with ourselves to do or convince ourselves to do put forth this willpower to will ourselves to do something that we don't actually really want to do right we know that we should but we don't it's not it's not naturally what we want to do but we only have so much of that in ourselves each day. the goal then is to craft the environment where choice and will isn't necessary because there's no other options. I don't have to ask myself if I'm going to have a cookie for breakfast if there aren't cookies in the house. So I created the path a little bit differently so that I can't wander into the cookies in the morning.
00:59:24 - mark sweet
Do you know what I mean?
00:59:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But anyway, just so finding the things that make the biggest impact and then setting up our environment in such a way that the things that negatively impact us throughout the day are not in our environment so that they have less opportunity to impact us negatively which means that we've got more energy which by the way the other thing was is that it affects our cognitive ability. So every time we have to use an employee willpower to tell ourselves to do the thing we don't want to do. or not do the thing that we want to do, we have less patience and ability to even solve, let's say it's a mathematical problem. Let's say it's a business problem, a system problem, hiring problem, whatever. have finite mental resources, which is obvious, right? But to understand that we can create the environment in such a way that it optimizes our day by reducing and minimizing the rest souls that we have to have that evoke, invoke, invoke, will power. Anyway, yeah, so just one on hand. There you go.
01:00:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You got to bounce. I got to go drop the car off, get new tires.
01:00:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have fun.
01:00:52 - mark sweet
task. My two cents, just get whatever cost it's going to charge you and wherever you're going, make them match it, because they always will, but they'll grumble about it, but I'll save you a bunch of books.
01:01:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Alrighty. It's possible to not have the ones I wanted, but I will do that. Just right. Also, we need to meet with Patsy's husband still. Go ahead and work on that. Thanks, Black. Yep. mean, yeah. Whatever. Someone's husband. Good job.
01:01:17 - mark sweet
Okay.
01:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you taking care of yourself?
01:01:23 - mark sweet
Yeah.
01:01:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you just say occasionally?
01:01:29 - mark sweet
Uh, yeah.
01:01:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Alright, um, how's Ronan?
01:01:37 - mark sweet
Uh, adorable, but shoot up my mom's hat. So, but it's a puppy.
01:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, this is gonna happen. don't know what she's expecting. For a couple of years, it's gonna happen.
01:01:47 - mark sweet
Yeah, but he's adorable, which is good.
01:01:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is he still coming to the office?
01:01:53 - mark sweet
Uh, occasionally. How is your mama? Um, we've had to deal with a lot of dads. stuff so it's just been a little hard not and you know none of this is a straight border easy unfortunately so now kind of pulling back well um I went to the fight the Nate Diaz fight which was fun on saturday oh yeah throw that with whole bunch of guys so that was fun to do um one of the guys filled this way with like their family's multi-billionaires which you know it's just always interesting to see people at those high high high levels but it's still the same stuff systems and processes and people like it's just on a bigger scale um send me this one thing because it cracks me up I was on the phone I was walking back and forth on our second floor and the squirrel just comes in just like lays down on top of the roof like he's just chilling and it just probably just find it mildly funny as well but yeah it's awesome
01:03:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And me and the pool for the last two days. I'm just like, I'm not doing anything. love sun. That's why I need to be living in Arizona.
01:03:11 - mark sweet
Monday is a big day next week. So the $10 million check case should be done because they have to give it to us by the 14th. So I get it that Monday. And then I got my personal million dollar cases due on that Monday, so don't. Kind of exciting.
01:03:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is fun. So to the, you going out and hanging out with friends, I will say that one of the best things that I think anybody could do, especially through different seasons of life is actively cultivate friendships and different types, just different people and socializing and along with the stuff that you're. going through, personally, at home, with mom and everything else. Just having people who know you, who are aware of you, laughing, laughing is really, really important. Having fun, having people that are maybe in similar seasons, but also who are where you want to be. Just thinking about those, but being really intentional about making those times, making time for that, and reaching out to make those connections proactively not worrying about whether or not somebody else initiates it or not waiting for anything, but just being really intentional is I think one of the best tools and one of the best hedges, rather than a lever, it's a hedge against depression, it's a hedge against just kind of sinking. Because there's so many different things that can come up in life, and so I hope that you do lots more of that. It's good for you, and you people love you. You're a good guy, and people need you too. So that's my pitch. think that you should spend more time making friends and having fun and letting people fall in love with you. Yeah.
01:05:27 - mark sweet
Yeah, no, it's good. On the up side.
01:05:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
On the what side?
01:05:32 - mark sweet
Yeah, it doesn't make you mild entertain. So we got to start out from my old law firm. And super well, what? Because it's a case that we'd already settled. So I basically say like, no attorney who signed this. So I'm not sure who to address the letter to. Obviously, I know the wrong law firm. But we've already settled the case. the policy limits. Despite, you know, fact that. I called the collision, I think, previous owner for teaching me how to turn lemons in the lemonade on these types of cases. And I used to say, so we're going to certainly send the file, and we're just going to finally need to be starting our full attorneys fees. The response I got back was, it was newly retained on our, and we'll drop. thought it could be a assistance in your training. Obviously, I would have made a different decision knowing what I learned discovery years ago regarding your employment by our firm. But that is your karma, you must work out and I'm happy I'm on the other end.
01:06:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What?
01:06:33 - mark sweet
Yeah, I don't know exactly what that means.
01:06:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
01:06:40 - mark sweet
So I asked my old boss, I was like, hey, do you have any clue what the hell she's talking about? Because there's, when they got raided in the DA got involved, that was bad. And then they sued each other when they ended. So I didn't know which discovery it was. Like I read it four times, I have no idea. So I'm sure I said something at some point. point is again the reason I learned lot what I learned was because she didn't show up or she was too intoxicated or whatever. She was in a meeting to just choke drunk or high. So I took a lot of meetings and met a lot of people that I wouldn't otherwise meet because of that so it worked well but not directly if that makes sense.
01:07:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So she was bitter and deflecting and she is bitter and deflecting.
01:07:27 - mark sweet
I'm sure I said something about it and you know at some point that of frustration whatever else and there's no excuse but more than sure I said something and so it was interesting. I tried to make friends with her when I left and she said it doesn't work that way and yeah.
01:07:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well whenever life is lessons and some of them really really suck but some are really really awesome. So yin and yang I'm telling you it doesn't matter like how good things get equal opposites will happen. So the better it It gets in some ways, the worse it gets and not necessarily directly, maybe it's just like the people around you, but it's it's kind of wild to notice. But I've learned that the the fortifying power of the good is that you can see the bad happening around you, but it is less impactful. And it it it doesn't create the pain that it could have the potential to create when you fill yourself up with so much goodness. And that's been interesting and fascinating to watch too that that that bad has less power to do its thing, you know.
01:08:44 - mark sweet
Yeah, it doesn't really bother me. It's just a little strong with people.
01:08:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, there's a lot of that all day long. What is wrong with you?
01:08:54 - mark sweet
Anyway, I got to deal with the angry, dead client person action.
01:08:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will talk to you later. Have a good day. I'm Mark. know you. Yep.

I mean, kind of it's tucked in my sister and we're ridiculous cackling into like one o'clock in the morning, like 12-year-old, but making red jokes like 10-year-old. 00:07:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It's plenty of to wake up in the morning. 00:07:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, 540. So that's who worked out so well for me. I'm a little punch drunk, Patrick. But it's okay. She had to get up at four o'clock. 00:07:54 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) She works at a methadone clinic. 00:07:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She's a nurse and she has a 45-minute drive. I have to, when she comes home, she's going to be dead driving on these windy roads. I kind of, I know kind of like, I do feel bad about that, depending on what the call is regarded. Right. See. Soon. And now this is tedious. I'm just doing this and that seems always full of the time, but it's not because formatting it will just do some things I want to get into kind of creating a structure for time. Okay. And this will be better for kind of visualizing it and making a correlation to case-in-case volume. My daughters' birds are going nuts, it's got parakeets, okay, let's see, so introduction call. now bear with me because systems optimization, all of this is a case-by-case kind of process, right? So there are fundamental things that I look for and ways at approaching it, but it gets customized is for multiple reasons, team, time, and also the person who's running the system or the people who are running the system. So, for example, I know you don't want to read books. There are, you're not the only one. I use this example because it's the first thing that comes to my mind of, like, Mark, I wanted to have him do a gratitude practice just to help him be in a more positive mindset because it works really well. He's like, Tina, he tried for a few weeks. didn't really push back. He just really didn't do it. He's like, it's not really my thing. I said, that's you got to tell me that because, you know, just because I suggested doesn't mean I think I know all the things and it has to be one way. It has to be the way that you will do it, the way that you can buy into it. If you don't buy into it, you're not going to do it. You're not going here. Continuing client. Elsie does this and does it best. Okay, we'll go back here. I can tie. Does it best? Okay, and client doctor. gonna guess that's also Elsie. Patrick and Elsie depending on what the calls regarding. Oh wait, I put that in there. I'm gonna just didn't get it actually there. Now this is why putting things in a good format to begin with, which I did not specify as far as she might have actually, but it's okay. Just because later. So Um, preparing demand letters, why I know you just have to do that. That's Mark wants you to do that. Right. 00:12:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Uh, all the attorneys right there demands. 00:12:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. We just had the conversation screw looking at AI demand writing services, negotiating and finalizing new settlements, doctor reductions and distributions. Now, I know that at least the distributions can be done by someone else. What about not necessarily on your team that you have somebody on your team that can do this, but these things could be done theoretically by someone else, right? Doesn't have a turning. Okay. At knowing who's on your team and definitely don't think anybody else would be. That's what is that? So one, two, four, what did I do? Yes, property damage. Copy and pasting would not be that difficult. Patrick, right, I'm just not. OK, all right, um, let me go into little bit a real question. Do not update the password. That's how I get locked out a bit of I could use. There's some stupid things. See. Is that this one? If I mess this up, I'm taking that out to you and I think it might be just one refresh. I the last 60 days or not. Actually, I think I want to know I want reset the parts. How would you be by attorney? All of the cases like attorney are matters by team. And then team Patrick. So you have 114. Oh. Then, let's set up 22 negotiations. What's it? 00:15:10 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It's one we like to disperse the money, but we keep a little bit, as we're still waiting on something. Like a health insurance link to pay, but we can distribute the client funds and take our portion without having to like wait for it. 00:15:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm to do one more thing. So, Mark just took some of your cases right and put them somewhere else. 00:15:53 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, we saw some things too. 00:15:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hank, right, okay. How many? I have a number of that skewed, so let me text Marco because I need him to give you guys a report and I keep forgetting to ask Mark. Hey, when are you going to get me a report that the attorneys can look at with all the stats I asked about? Like weeks ago. I need a saucy face. Whoops. Come on, man. I'm dictating. Okay, so I need that because this should have a correlation to the closed date. But it'll be interesting to, let's see how we made that correlation. Again, I know that it seems like a very scattered frame, but this is the time that we spend creating the process and kind of putting structure on where the time goes is worth it. And it is kind of, I don't know, not just like it's disjointed, like there's trying to wrap around everything. So I'll see, I'll see. Cynthia, Cynthia ordering final medical records, initial documents, sending different insurance inquiries, um, and or policy limits. I also need people's time reports. okay. So Cynthia works in the office or at home or, okay. They're both in the office. And she's there every day. 00:18:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Cynthia, I'll see why it's a week is home. 00:18:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I'm just going to put nuts for myself. I'm just getting like overall operational structure so that I wrap my head around it. So do you think that you have a ballpark average estimation of how long these particular tasks take average, right? Obviously, there will be outliers, some that go very quick, some go very long. If I put a column here, do you think that you could give that? 00:19:42 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Is that just like property damage, like let's say just for one client, it could be like over the period of like two, three weeks to get it done? 00:19:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so here's what we'll do because time has to be We'll go to complete, like so, or phase, because I kind of like these different phases, and then um, estimated time, um, like, minutes, hours spent, like this task type, right? So, like, how, ordering the policy limits, I mean, like anything where you've got to call insurance, sometimes those calls, like, take a while, right? chasing clients down, and so I know that that's not going to have a real number two, but it'll give me some kind of ballpark, and it'll help, it'll just help in the mental process of kind of creating this, and then trying to figure out basically what is the best type of flow throughout world. the day in terms of like blocking types of tasks. And then also looking at it and going, how often do we need to go through this cycle for all the cases that you have so that we're not waiting two or three weeks before we check on the next thing? Does that make sense? Because I don't think right now that you have anything where you do that, like where you look at a checklist, basically, and everybody just mentally goes through a checklist. The problem with that is we are statistically human beings are terrible self reporters. So if you mentally are saying you went through the thing, right, you don't check on it, you don't look at something, we're going to forget or assume the other thing is, it's like the bystander effect that that we assume that somebody else has done the thing. As as Especially if there's a thing where there's, there's two people who do it. So I'll see in Cynthia. I'm like, oh, well, I'll see mine is done then or whatever. So if we have a list and we just kind of go through it and and you've got a list of your cases, checking off whatever things are done. And then whatever stage that we're in now. Do you have something like that in Lidified that has all of these statuses. Yeah, I didn't think so. Okay. And you don't have anything that that you could just go through and say it's in this section. It's in this status. It's in this status. Right. And can some of these be happening simultaneously? Yeah. Okay. So that's another thing that I want to know. So, um, um, can happen. currently it so we'll do that and I'm going to let's see yeah okay so let's see the concurrent first introduction calls obviously it's first thing one of the things can be happening whoa at the same time let's go down that row confirming coverages and liability I feel like that's kind of its own thing that has to happen first and then true it has to happen so none of these like these are all standalone right and then yeah assessing property damage you can probably be working on that while you're setting up for treatment yep okay so this is not for let's see let's say that can happen I'm going do number three for sending defendant insurance inquiry request or D&D. That can also happen, right? Same time-ish. You don't have to wait for setting up treatment and property damage to do sending defendant insurance inquiry or do you? 00:24:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) So typically you wouldn't be doing the treatment if you're sending those insurance and because basically we're trying to see if there's any insurance. 00:24:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so this goes before treatment? 00:24:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:24:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so I'm going to cut these, bring them down here, drag everything up, change this. Okay, let's go through the order then first in case there's anything else that can't be done before the thing above it. Can you hear these first? Yeah, I got to make sure the doors are closed next time. 00:25:33 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Okay. It looks like no, it's in order. 00:25:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, now it's an order. Okay, so one, two, the defendant. Insurance inquire request or DMV insurance chart request. So that will disregard the numbers. Actually, I'm going to go like this. One. Hey, that's not what was supposed to work, dude. Appreciate that. Okay. So any defendant insurance, um, is there anything else that happens with this or is that like preliminary that has to be done before we get to the next steps. 00:26:29 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Um, I guess you can do the intro call and stuff or it would already be done. 00:26:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, so do we need to change this order again? 00:26:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) No, I mean, typically the intro call would be done at that point. The intro call is like the first thing. So. 00:26:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So do we send the this before confirming or are they. 00:27:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It kind of does in techno can't be so like you do the intro call and you know, you they don't have the defense insurance information Actually number four order initial documents as police reports you would put that before setting defendant insurance thing Okay Could Since it's both Cynthia, okay, what else So ordering policy limits medical referrals You can do those simultaneously Okay 00:28:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) five, six. I'm just going to do this together, five, six. Okay. Um, what else? 00:28:24 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) seven, eight, nine and six can all be done together. 00:28:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) six, seven, eight, two, one, two, five, ten. Wait, now that's right. Oh, I'm thrown off because the rest of that. Oh, that's why I'm sorry. Never mind. This is definitely its own thing, own thing, own thing, own own thing, right? property damage weight. 00:29:12 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Property damage you can do with five, six, three. 00:29:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Then can three be done with five and six also. 00:29:55 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:29:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, because what I mean when I. say done with it is like basically it's not contingent, like you can't, you don't have to wait for anything. Okay, just want to make sure we're on the same page. Okay. So, do you feel like most of the work is done linearly, like people thinking that it's this step, then this step, rather than here's all the things that we could be doing for this case right now, what do you think is more likely that is happening? 00:30:38 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Probably like step by step. 00:30:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So, just this right here would probably could probably really help the flow of the cases. Knowing how many cases you have now, here's what I don't know is how long it takes and how much waiting there is and how good it is, but. What I would guess is that there's a lot of time people are just not really working super hard and at stuff and sitting there just thinking about the cases maybe and just glancing at the records and not really pushing it forward. What do you think? Do you think that because obviously I'm not, I don't want anybody. I'm making a wild assessment. 00:31:30 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I'm sure there's like times in the day where it's just like things slow down. Obviously, happens with me too. But I do think like some of these things like policy limits, like that takes like five minutes. You know, so it's like, let's say you're, or you just got off a long call and you don't want like take a call right now or something. You don't want to make a call. could like do the policy limit real quick. It takes five minutes. You just didn't put the info. 00:32:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So here's where I'm getting out with this. And this is my hard- slide that people don't really like, but you'll have no problem with your team. don't know. And and also you're kind of laid back. So if you're not looking at it this way, but my guess would be, especially based off of the conversations I've had with Mark about how things go, is that there are probably several gaps throughout the day, every day of the week, where not much is getting done and could be getting done. Because if you have 116 cases, and most of them are in a status of needing to get something, there are probably 116 calls that could be made somewhere in the team throughout the day. they're hourly, right? You're not, right? Or are you hourly? No, but they are, right? Um, I would bet that all the billable time is not used very effectively or, um, I would just bet that there was a lot of just about 10% level effort. Being put, and this isn't talking about your team statistically. I'm talking about people in general. And I think part of the nature of it is not necessarily laziness or unwillingness to work. I think it is the volume of things to do and the mental effort. And I think it's a lot. I would not do this job. This would be tedious. I would hate it. But, you know, that's me, I didn't go into this. but what I think could happen is if we work through this for a little while, go through it with Lorenz and get an idea, I would love to see you do is kind of create some structure and say, look, here's the list of cases that we have, even if you put it in a spreadsheet and if you're using Microsoft Office, you probably have a sweet lot account, right, with Microsoft. So, it's secure. Everything stays on your own drive, stays, you know, where only sweet lot people could get to it. You could check it with Lidify. You could have some other kind of identifier. don't know if Lidify doesn't have, like, case IDs. does matter IDs. Okay. that would get really confusing. I feel like I'll ask Mark if we could do this. And based off of other work that we've done together, I feel like he would be okay with that. And I'll show him this and see what he thinks. But honestly, I think that this could be really useful across all of Sweet Law. Because just the mental taxing effort of trying to track all the different, like you only have 160, but 116 is a lot. And some of the other teams have 300, you're going to have more. And whatever state that they're in, somebody needs to be checking to see, is it waiting on us? Is it waiting on them? If it's waiting on them, one was the last contact point. If it's more than 24 hours or two business days or whatever, you deem appropriate that we do follow up. So just going through a checklist of here's the things that have to get done. Here's the list of cases. Here was the last touch. So then there were be another column that's okay so like we would have this as a checklist while people just kind of get used to it like oh yeah I could be doing this here's all the things that have to be done and there's a spreadsheet with all the matters on it and then so I really want to see what you guys look at letify what do you do and letify what do you guys record and letify what do you use it for everything like the whole case is on there yeah so all the notes um so like you could go in here like click the matter yeah so this is what I see when I open the case so there's highlight activity can I click on activity I mean I can but so it'll show the last time somebody We touched it, but not necessary. I tried to call and nothing happened, right? 00:37:07 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Um, you could pull like left a voicemail still pending, whatever. 00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. timeline. No. How would you, um, like, no, what's the, what's going on? Yeah. What's the last thing that happened? 00:37:32 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Who, who touched it last? So, on the left side, this big, like, paragraph, how you do it there first. Okay. 00:37:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, yeah. So these are all the notes. 00:37:49 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) These are, they use this side for like, made, like bigger points. Like she's got an injection. So I want to know like that. And then on the right side, the, um, the activity. But if you scroll down, these are more like calls, email the sent out, things like that. 00:38:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) OK, so let's you look at both. OK, let's just let's just run through these real quick and look at something. So this was last touch yesterday. We're going to go like boom, boom through a lot, really quickly. Last touch three months ago. OK, tell me what we are going look at to go. Why was this only the last note three months ago? 00:38:37 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Can you go to the conversations? I know he's still treating, so we could sound like a follow-up text just to keep it on the I loop on what's going on with the case, but he's still in treatment. 00:39:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So, um, do you know when treatment is supposed to be over? 00:39:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Um, can you scroll up to the damages? 00:39:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And tell me like, scroll over here and then the far left. Oh, here. Click on it. 00:39:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:39:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) This doesn't total it for you, huh? But it should, because you are trying to hit policy limits, right? 00:39:47 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It does on the other page. But this. Yeah. Okay. Right. 00:39:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There are total damages. And. And where does it say what the policy limits are here? 00:40:04 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, if you go to insurance on it right there. So it's 150. 00:40:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I'm 50,000. 00:40:16 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:40:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) OK, so that's not likely. would think to hit a policy limit. So then, um, um, I'm not sure how much more I'm to do under this. Yeah, so it again, I know this much, right? So I'm just asking questions. How would you know? I mean, OK, you know that he is in treatment, but if there's no contact for three months, how do you know that they're still going? 00:41:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) you know that they haven't so is there a time period that a person can stop going for treatment that affects the case yeah more so in the beginning like if they don't go to treatment like a month and it's like the big red flag but not later it kind of depends but like if they're waiting for a surgery or something it's obviously going to take some time to schedule it and stuff like that but so as long as the initial doctor's assessment is there that has said these are all the things that they need they kind of have a window a significant window to accomplish it like basically they should be going consistently up until like the pain management visit after that it's like take some time to schedule injections or surgeries or things like that so there's some like I guess there, but like initial appointment, there shouldn't be any gaps really. 00:42:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So is there a reason why it wouldn't make sense to have at least a monthly follow up with somebody or every couple of months at a particular stage help me figure out like, if you were to look at this and just make sure you're on top of it and not assuming that things are going a particular way, what could you do that's not really bugging the client but is being proactive and making sure that things are going along a schedule? 00:42:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Like a quick text? Yeah. Every 30 days or something? 00:42:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Do you think that that's reasonable to at least have your team attend every 30 days? Okay. So we're just going to put this down here, attend. Well, so let's say we don't hear back for every 30 days. So let's say, okay, it's in 30 days, we send a text message. If we don't hear back, then do we check a week later and just keep doing it every week until we do hear back, just to make sure that we're still connecting? 00:43:18 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:43:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, let's see the text. Um, in the case with no contact. Um, well, I'll say example, in treatment. Really, that's probably the only thing, because everything else you'd be talking to a doctor or insurance, or you need to be talking to them about distributions, right? So this would probably be the only time that there's just an okay period to not be talking for a while and not managing the time. 00:44:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Is that correct during treatment? Yeah, I mean, you want to make sure they're going and stuff, but like, there's a certain point where It's less required because like, let's say, they can appointment for like October 28 for an injection, right? Right. It's kind of like It's a month away. 00:44:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There's no point. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. What I'm saying is, is there any other status here that the case could be in where It's acceptable to not hear or not have any communication efforts for even more than a few days. 00:44:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Negotiations like I got a 30 days for the insurance to respond. So There's not really not going to be much update until I hear back type of thing. 00:44:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So that makes sense. Um, but if the insurance has responded, then you're in a new state. 00:45:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Anyway, right or you're still dealing with it. No, it's still negotiations, but I have to update the client on what the offer was things like that. 00:45:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I better. Yeah. Okay. Um, all right. So we were going back in here. Let's just go ahead and. don't want that. Look at a few more cases real quick. Last one September 13, just a few days ago. So, um, mailing insurance, companion matter, oh, um, like, incidences in the same, like, multiple people. Okay, like Yeah. Okay. Yesterday, Saturday, four months ago. 00:46:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) And this one, I texted her recently. 00:46:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I'm stations. 00:46:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Right. Go back. 00:46:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. And you would think that that would be more useful on the home page, just immediately there, but okay, so that's been touched. Good job. This is what we want to see though is that, that says July 24th, don't go to conversations. 18th year to go. Okay, well actually, let me ask you a question. 00:47:28 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) So he's just still in treatment. 00:47:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. I'm going to keep getting them until three months out, because it's all up, okay, three months out. I didn't pay attention to which one I was on, I'm just going to look down here. July 24th. Two months ago. So. Um, what should we look at to see, like, uh, still have back pain and decided to get that after all? Uh, that was three months ago, which I'm gonna call, yeah, I mean, that seems like that should be followed up with what do you think? 00:48:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, was there a note on the website at all? 00:48:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, details right here, July 24th was the last thing. 00:48:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, so this one has to be touched. 00:48:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So here's what I would recommend for you just to, again, so we're just trying to figure out what helps you get things done the quickest without being tedious. Now, the amount of volume that you have, maybe you spread it out across a couple of days, but this wouldn't take very long, especially if you did this every week and just literally went in, clicked on all of them real quick, because what would happen is if you started doing that and you started following up with your team, they should be doing this. They should be checking on their stuff and you go look at it and go, yeah, they're on it. And then you just start to do it as just kind of randomly going through the cases as a audit and just be like, hey, is there anything that has gone too long without being touched? And if so, who did it? Why are we unclear about what the expectations are? just think that we shouldn't, but is there a disagreement internally about whether we should or we shouldn't? is there not enough clarity about what requires a response? Is it that some people just feel like they're bothering clients? And, and, and does that need to be trained because like, who's bothered by getting the job done for them that we're supposed to do, getting it wrapped up posted up that type of thing. 00:50:11 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:50:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) be something that you'd be willing to do is just just go like once a week, just once a week. And you can split it across two days if it just is annoying, but honestly, that should go really quick. I think, I think you could be done with all your cases in an hour. Just click, get out. Because most of them, you're going to see, yep, they touched it. Yep, they touched it. Yep, they touched it. There should only be a few where you're like, that's a long period, or you know that you looked at that last week. And you know that they're not at a time period that, because you already looked at it, right, that we should be messaging out. It's going to be a few more weeks. So after the first couple of times, it shouldn't take you very long. Yeah. But the insight into the gaps should be really quick and really clear. Would you do that? 00:51:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, I mean, my file reviews are basically that. 00:51:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:51:06 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) So, once you've clicked our older cases, I should focus on those. But typically, on the new ones, I'll just check like the intro call was done. We've found insurance to take set liability. Basically, get the case, like the green light to start treating it. Middle ones are more, you know, where are they at? Are they going? going? Do they fall off? Are they missing? And then the really old ones is typically settled or we're just like waiting on health insurance, lean type of things. yeah, mean, I pretty much do what you just asked. But yeah, this case needs to be touched for sure. 00:51:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, what is your schedule for doing that and making sure you've covered that? 00:52:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) all the cases, like what's the frequency? I try to do it at least every other day. 00:52:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) All the cases? 00:52:10 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Not all of them, but like we'll go through a portion of my case list. The other week we've got like a bunch of new files. like, you know, I went ahead and went through all those, make sure like what first of all see what the case is. Is it like a big case, small case? What potential issues we might have with it? Where to send a client for treatment? 00:52:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So would you just be willing then, let's say this is a starter, top to bottom, I'm looking at the way that we just looked at it. then also, and because we're running out of time, I don't know there's enough for you to tell me all of this, but like I'd like to understand all the things that you look at when you do file review. Now, we did talk about, would you be willing to do file review with your team yesterday? You did. And how many files did you go through? 00:53:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) We just felt like we did like 40 minutes. I think we went through like 10 cases. 00:53:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so that's a long process. So my version of this audit is definitely not as thorough as what I think that you were doing. But there were two cases that probably should have been touched that we found in the first few. And like you said, they were older. So what I would like is just once just go through everything top to bottom. And then next week when we're all meeting, of give me some insight as to what you discovered and realize, okay, we should be doing it this way. And maybe it's by the age of the case. Maybe it's by a status or something like that, but. How can we just make sure that we're not going too long without touching the case and making contact with the client? And yeah, it's just about making sure because there are so many moving pieces, so many cases, so many different things to do, so many different reasons, it's not a fluid process, right? Because there's so much waiting on insurance, on doctors, on the patient, the client. So it could be really easy to have for things to fall through the gaps. So having a very specific process that makes sure that the only way to not have things fall through the cracks is top to bottom. could do that broken up as long as you're sorting the cases by date, right, by the day that they open, not because until they're closed. And so let's say you starting with the most recent cases up to like the most recent 50 cases, and then the next one, the next day, the next review, whatever, within that week, two weeks max, you're getting to the next 50. But then, so what I also think is two types of fire review. is just the quick glance, did it get touched, which you could go through all those 116 cases, probably in an hour. And you wouldn't have to go through all of them every week because they're, you know, they'd be really quick. So there's that version of it, and then there's the thorough, are there opportunities for us to like, do we need to do something different? But what I think will happen preemptively, is that as you go through in your skin, you'll go, you know what, we don't need to review that as a team, I saw enough of it, it's good. So then you can mark the cases that you probably should review as a team, have some questions about or somebody else you saw, there was a question that somebody on your team had, and then save those for the team power reviews because there's potentially something to discuss, whereas if everything looks good, you can just be like, you know what, nothing to discuss there, so you don't need to waste the team's time with basically managerial kind of oversight effort, which would be better with you for the most part anyway. So how do you think, how do you feel about that? 00:56:42 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, I think that's the best way to do it because naturally we all go through our cases just to see what's, you know, available to be settled or, you know, these cases are my responsibility at the end of the days, so I need to know, you know, where they're at. and make sure that they get maximized. no, I think you'd write, it's the best way just to go through each one. 00:57:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so let's give that a try. I would love by the time that we meet next Tuesday that you had a chance to just go through everything and look at that and just kind of note anything. One thing I would love to note is how many cases had not been touched in more than 30 days. Do you remember that? Yeah. Okay. And just anything else that might have stood out and let's do the longest. Like, so whatever you notice, like, so there's one that hasn't been touched for three months. If you see anything longer than that, like, I want to know what's the longest that they had reached out just to check and make sure. and then here's our next step, just kind of restating the expectations of how the case will proceed. Does that make sense? Just people are people, know, and especially if they're going through hard things, there's a huge difference for really it's just a little amount of effort. It could just be the text message, right? And you could even have fairly canned text messages that are but let me fix this before putting in the number and or I guess if you're using the automations, it's already there so just be careful. But just it's that feeling of we are aware of you and we're at and we're checking in on you. It's a human nature nurture. 00:59:50 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) no, I get it. I mean, we don't really think about it because, you know, we see the cases every day but it's a business perspective for you, but nearby. 01:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like something traumatic and bad happened to me and all of this sucks and somebody called to check on me and it made my day, you know? 01:00:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 01:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It could do a lot for us and it can also increase referrals possibly if we just really made somebody feel good. It's a little thing. It could have a big impact over time and a compounding effect too as we gained that reputation for just really kind of holding, it's not hand holding, it's 30 days, but compared to just waiting through things, you know, make them not feel like it's a number and a transaction, that type of thing. Okay. Well, we were able to have that whole conversation because you did all of this, so great job. 01:00:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I'm here to see Lorenz have stuff that I didn't know on there. 01:00:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, so we're all meeting next week and we will take a look at it and I think that that is going to be useful too. I'm really glad that you guys want to do that. the the working together thing because I think it's going to be insightful and even if it's just like a five percent difference um but if you give him five percent of your good stuff and he gives you five percent of his good stuff you know none you're both you're both just getting better and and then we're all getting better insight into the whole thing it's good you know that's not good you got to fix that i know that's what navies are for i can't take it out though because i have conversations every day or no no i can't because i just lift super heavy until i can't and then i can't walk for a few days but my strength increases i lose weight i still have more energy my like i did some studying and it's crazy like it's like kind of a new hack. I don't have to exhaust myself. So yes, I I could do better. My last lake press was 390 though, and it was smooth like butter. So I was pretty happy with that, okay? 01:02:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Okay. I'll be able to work out every day. You won't stay up late because you'll hate yourself afterwards. 01:02:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I know, but I'll be so tired all the time. I ain't trying to be like that. And I just no. Naps are cool. Did you know I'm gonna leave you with this? It's like 80 reduction in cardiovascular events for people, especially men who take naps three or more times a week of at least 20 minutes. Massive benefit. 01:02:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I don't know I'm a weekend for sure. 01:02:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, you gotta get, you gotta get one in the middle of the week, just a little 20 minute. Maybe not. You're still young, but you're not up there like grandma here. All right, it was great talking to you. 01:03:02 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) What time is it? 01:03:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) two. Yeah, oh, we're over. I will nag mark for the report again. He did this emoji. 01:03:11 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Good luck. Have a great day. I'll talk to you next week. Good to see you. You too. Bye-bye. Bye. patrick@sweetlaw.comPatrick
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You Thank you. Hi, how are you? 00:04:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) How are you? 00:04:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Sleepy. I'm not fully awake yet. didn't eat yet. daughter took my, well, older daughter took my younger daughters to seminary. So got to sleep in a little bit, but I was up till two working. So. No, it's just the way my body works better like that. Yeah, but also I have a missionary training at nine o'clock. So, are we going to have to check? Sure. think I do. I do. So, anyway, what were we talking about yesterday? 00:05:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We were talking about mama bear marketing, um, talking about the, um, the Google Doc we have on there in the community and how to build the offers and all that stuff. then your boxers, just listened to and yeah, so I did have a fun night last night. Thank you. And, um, and then this morning, I actually was at my mom's for bit and then, but you know, I feel a little off-kilter and then after this call after I picked my dog up because I didn't do my Bible journaling or anything this morning because I just got off and went straight to artwork and then helping my mom. Um, but uh, yeah, so in the chat chat stuff, yeah, that's cool too. I remember Ravi doing that when I used to work for him a couple years ago. So, and yeah, that was cool. I think me and Karina were going to launch a AI thing for e-com for Shopify stuff. I know we were building a little bit of about two, but we never really launched it per se, except everyone still goes to the free version. But I get what you mean, like what would Maria say? Like, that is, it is powerful. 00:06:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, Yeah. Um, I was trying to figure out if I could figure out who I'm bear marketing was. Cause I remember there's this lady that's been around a long time also. 00:06:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And her name is Barb Ling. Oh, Barb Ling. Yeah. 00:06:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She goes by mama bear now. 00:06:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, oh, I thought she used to be just barbelling marketing or something. 00:06:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. might be, but she on Facebook now, she's mama bear B. Oh. 00:06:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, I'm a barbelling authority marketing coach. Yeah, she bought some stuff for me in the back of the day. And then she also, it was in the worry form of doing good offers. Like she's just a decent person, you know? that offers. 00:07:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm on her page and she doesn't say mama bear on her website but she just shows coffee. That's why I remember her. She's really in the coffee. That's right. 00:07:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) yeah, she says on apology baby blue word 23 plus year veteran marketer coffee appreciator moose wrangler and more virtual coach. yeah, she doesn't have mama bear anywhere here but you're right. Maybe she just recently really branded. 00:07:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, no, this is um, if you go to facebook.com slash mama bear entrepreneur. That's her. 00:07:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah, I would. 00:07:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, and I think that that's That's her old profile that she switched over. 00:08:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, Fred's. Oh, she can't use that because that's a personal page, not a business page. 00:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. And I can't switch mine to a professional page, not, not business, but professional. It's not an option for me, which is weird. 00:08:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Anyway, yeah. Yeah, I'm just shocked to see that it's not a page page. Did they take that functionality away? Because it used to be pretty easy that you could switch it over to a professional page. 00:08:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I don't know when I have more than 500 followers and half for a long time. 00:08:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So I don't know why I wouldn't be able to. But I mean, it's been years since I've had a client do that. But yeah, I'm going to try to get maybe there was a glitch. I always think something's not working that should work on Facebook. Then it's a glitch and go back next day and try. 00:08:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, any of it, I've been looking at it for months because. they have analytics now. 00:09:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And it's not a business page, it's a newer thing. It's not, it's gone. 00:09:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Anyway, um, so I want to be paying attention to the time with my brain. I did want to share with you though, one thing that Dan sent me, I'll just put it in the notes. Um, it's okay, I bought it, and I would share it with you if you wanted it, but um, hold on a second, gonna find chat here. Really inexpensive, and I think the only thing I'd probably use it for would be maybe some quick um, graphic type creation. I haven't gone through everything yet. their sales page, showed that they have some automations for graphics, but a lot of variety. And they do have AI. I'm playing with it to see. I don't like to finish products. don't think it's quality enough to be representative me, but I do think this type of stuff is sometimes good for repurposing old things. And one of the tests that I wanted to run was kind of a side-by-side faceless type of campaign to see what can be done because there's a lot of faceless marketing. People don't care about knowing, liking, and trusting if it's not a huge investment. They care about, are you teaching me something useful? And I got, I don't know if I still have it, businessprofessor.ai, where I would basically repurpose the same content and just change the voice a little bit to not necessarily be about the mom's side and the personal details as much, but still the same. The value of the content. tactics, principles, things like that, because the duplication shouldn't be that difficult if I get low cost, you know, assistant. And then if I'm duplicating it, but under a different brand sufficiently, it shouldn't be anything that's penalized and it would be like diversifying, basically. But it's an experiment I want to run because the audiences are so much bigger than they were, even just a few years ago, even pre-COVID. And it keeps growing this world of, you know, people wanting to side hustle, things like that. was thinking about, you know, even when I was a kid, my mom did, Mary Kay, Tupperware, Avon, what else did she do? But there was, women were selling things. And then there was, you know, the candles and the melaleuca and the amway and all that type of stuff. So, but now they've got the internet. I just think that it's, and the statistics are there, but there's just so many people to get to who aren't internet marketers per se, who are maybe they sell at the farmers market on the weekend. they could be taught about profit margins and simple things like that. So anyway, kind of thinking about how to expand stuff. Instead of, I always feel like I get trapped in the high ticket world and high value and high level. I, there's only, like I said, there's only so much of that you can do anyway, because high level clients require high level performance and investment. And so, you know, there's only a few of that. Everything else needs to be leveraged. And I just realized, like, there's a lot of people who know almost nothing and just to be able to teach them. So, anyway, those thoughts. But, and then, okay, so we were talking about potentially starting something with both of us as a kind of like a baseline foundation and being able to. And I mean, even at the same time, parallel, while we're not working together, kind of duplicate some of that work. Like, we could create a school group or a high level community that's similar and just start piping people in and figuring out a very low level schedule like where once a week we show up and answer questions. And, but because high level has rocking, like, let's say you make a reference from your existing group that you're building into this group, that link would be a tracking link. So those people are tracked from day one. So if those people buy anything, no matter what they buy, you get the higher level commission. And because like I have Facebook followers, that would just come in and do things. And we can decide if we want to create it as a free group or, you know, maybe it's $20 a month and it's low cost. And we're going to show up and talk to each other anyway. But how scalable is that? How many people would want to come in? I'm thinking volume of people who have trusted enough to give a credit card for $20 and to make a commitment for $20 a month. I think that could add up pretty quickly. But then, as we're talking to them every week, figure out, okay, what are you guys interested, what are you responding to? Where does the conversation not where does it consistently go? 00:15:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Let's offer that. 00:15:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let's make a training. Okay, this training is going to be $200 and this is what we're going to do. And we don't even have to like we can go run ads separately to bring people into that training. But if we have a group full of people who have already paid $20 a month and half of them have said, I really need to know this. And you and I know it doesn't matter what they want to know, we're going to be able to teach it quickly, live probably. And then provide some really good resources which we can take to VAs. I've got a ton of them of different sorts, video graphics, PDFs, all the works where we can take the live content that we made and then go make some pretty visual supports for them. And then that becomes an evergreen product that already exists in the members area. like, hey, you have this problem. Here's all our testimonials, these people. we give this to them and and you can have it now and it does not have to be a live training and if then you know if something goes really well we can say we'll do the live training again in a few months whatever if people want live more because they can do Q&A then we charge more that's the thing but there's so many different topics we could just do that on repeat but then so the Maria Tina version is always going to be a little different than just Maria riffing all by herself and just Tina riffing all by herself but especially if we really kind of like if it's a marketing question I'm glad Maria go at it and I'll have a little bit pieces and if it's a business management operations kind of stuff then I'll go at it and you contribute when you have a little something to say you might have a lot to say but if we agree that we're going to kind of let the other one shine in a particular area but give the other space and go So, yeah, I actually have really something good to contribute I want to share so that we get a well-rounded thing, know, so we're not competing, but we are kind of compartmentalizing so that we can establish separate brands under one roof for our personal benefits while still serving the community really well. I think that that could work and just flow, especially because I'm not going to get offended that if you've got some great ideas, I'm going like, that's awesome, and I can have eyes. 00:17:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think that's, there's something there, yeah, I can't get my full hand around it of all the tracking, know, because I also don't want to fall down from it, you know. 00:17:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It won't be hard, and we could ask Dan for it, but it won't be hard. It's really, all it is, is anybody that comes into us has to to be tracked once because the source tracking so they're either coming in from an ad that we did which we would be tracking where they're coming in from one of our personal links and we just need to make sure if we want credit for it right that each of those links are trackable so if you're you would just have one group or you could have multiple links and I would show you how to do it so that you know it and I could even set them up for you if you don't even want to touch it and just be like Maria this is it and we'll go do a test test like source right and make sure that they're tagged as came from Maria we'll just put Maria something like that right and then show you so then if that person makes a purchase we'll have to figure out how to how to do their reporting and the commission structure but for sure Dan would help with that and if he didn't do it for free I'd hire somebody to do it but high level does that really easily okay yeah that's one of the great benefits of it And if the community is in high level and the sales are in high level, it's all there. Yeah. So, yeah, it would actually be really not quite as simple as doing it without the tracking, but the tracking is not going to be difficult. 00:19:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. Well, that's cool. That's cool. So, and just on another note, when you brought up Designer, I shared screen real quick. 00:19:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I've been using it since 2016. 00:19:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah. 00:19:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let me share screen right now. 00:19:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, I don't, haven't used AI, AI, AI part. See that 2016, I created the e-commerce email promotions, like it's a product I used to sell, don't know, for like seven bucks, low ticket offer. that's really big. something's worth about it. Anyway, but yeah. and actually just the recent YouTube video that did really well, I made the product here, the 100 digital offers. So I made it obviously in chat should be T first and some of my own input. And then I used the template and just like put in my own graphic here of the screenshot. And then it's just super, super simple. 00:20:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's not as pretty as camera. 00:20:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) but it did the job and I needed done like in about 10 minutes before I put it in the community. See, I bought, I haven't pinpointed it yet. Where is marketing master account? need to re send it to my school community. But anyway, so yeah, that's cool. 00:20:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I've done that. I want to share something with you too so you can see I need to feed it more data to this library. 00:20:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) But what does Dan think? what we should be offering and all that stuff? he have any ideas input? Because sometimes I'm going to be honest, sometimes I get too confused. you know, when I start thinking about all the things, and maybe just because I'm not centered, because I haven't done my bible stuff here. 00:21:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Meditations are journaling this morning. I didn't ask him, but we could if you want to do, I think he is a massive Maria fan and Tina fan. So ask, ask, um, pretend you're a person that has a business question, fairly simple, um, about business operations or principles or strategies or even problem solving. Let's see how this AI does. 00:21:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, um, how do I get traffic from YouTube marketing? 00:21:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I haven't, it will be my kind of content, like, um, just, just not marketing specific, like, um, what should I pay my stuff? hiring people, how should I choose what to work on? um, yeah, pretty much anything that's not marketing strategy specific. 00:22:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) How could I get more productive in my business, family? 00:22:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I told you not to say, ah, would never say that. 00:22:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Look at that. It affects hourly rate now for the game changer. yeah. 00:23:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Now, go make that magic. 00:23:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) You got this. 00:23:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I mean, if for just being able to ask a question that that would give if somebody had never experienced that. Yeah, that we get them started. Anyway, so I haven't vetted all of my content yet, because you can only give it 10 files. So what I have to do, and I'm going to hire a VA to do this, is combine multiple transcripts into a single file, because it's not really, I don't know what the limit to the eyes of the files is, but I haven't anywhere near approached that. Okay, so just putting it into single files. And then I've also included the transcripts of testimonials from clients. Really long ones on YouTube that give details as to like what I can do for them. So anyway, yeah, just this. So I want to use this to when it's trained properly create short pieces of content for me based off of things I've already created and done. So if I want to pick a topic in any, I don't necessarily want to just use it as it comes out. For sure, I would edit some of these things all the time the struggle. No, that's no. Tell me your AI without telling me your AI that. But and take something, put some bones on it and go like, Oh, yeah, okay, well, tweet this, tweet this, even ask it a question because it's asking it from my library of vast library of information once I get all my calls in there and then be able to repurpose it according to okay well this is a Twitter post I wanted to and I know you can do threads on Twitter but if I wanted to make it shorter and make it like one line each so I can break it up into Instagram quotes and then go send it to a VA who plugs it into some images from you know really quickly there's like four and five dollar an hour VA is still that are good at Canva and I don't know if they're as fast as maybe eight or ten dollar VA's so that's an experiment I'm going to be playing with and I usually hire a couple people and just kind of try them against each other see what ends up being most profitable just because people are cheaper for our doesn't mean that they're cheaper for our. got it, got it. Yeah. So anyway, but yeah, um, what, what would help you get some clarity on the opportunity of what it would look like to do work together. Um, so that's, well, so that it's clear and then you can decide, do you want to put any mental energy into it or not. 00:26:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Um, I think, I think just like, so we got the free community, right? 00:26:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It can be free. It can be paid. It can be paid from, from the beginning, just low cost, like really low cost, but so that we know that we've got people who want to be there enough with their money, who have enough trust to pass over a credit card. 00:26:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay, so it's almost like, uh, I kind of do this when I. Great offers for people who share screen. know you got to go like a little minutes. Share screen. It'd be sort of is one that I've done with us for I'm possible. So basically like customer journey map like like like these are different. So like you know step one was micro offer magic you know then or about social group and five so step one could be like a community five bucks month. Maybe we make it like one buck a month or five bucks a month or whatever ten bucks a month and then what in their customer journey what is it like what step to what's that offer there and like what are we thinking right like what so we can kind of yeah so so like and if I go I don't know who else I've done a few of these four. or community. 00:28:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I have a quick idea for that the first variation. think the first version is you come into the community and we both have free pieces of content that they can consume so that they can get familiar with us and just kind of have a place and we encourage just talking. So it's basically another version of an email list, kind of. We can communicate with them. But it's in a place where so high level has an app, I think. And it's like lead something, whatever. But it's mobile and they have magic links so that people can open some things right from their email and go straight to the paid member area. And I'm OK with using school and paying for that too, if they need me. for sure, we'd want to charge like $5 a month or something. The first level is, we're going to put in lots of our content, pre-existing content, and you have access to it, and then the second level could be also not very much, and it could be either, like for me, could be they get the profit time, energy maximizer, and maybe one of your products, that is a paid product, but low cost. In addition, we'll have weekly meetings and you can show up to it, and so we maybe put the recordings in the free group, but they don't get to ask questions unless they're in the paid group, or in the like the five dollar month group, they get recordings, and let's say $20 or $40 a month group, you can come in and ask questions and we will answer your questions. So, the lower level group is you get our content, not our time. The next level up is you get our content and our time. And the next level up could be something much more high level once we figure out and we start talking to people. 00:30:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Good. 00:30:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) else are you going to go get 20 year veterans in business, women, know, that have been online veterans. It's not very, it's not easy to find. 00:30:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) No, I know I'm going to have an analyze them and I probably should join their community. 00:30:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) If I go to school discovery. 00:30:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) There's one woman that. I imagine in this grandma is making a lot and has all these people in that community. It's really right at the top of your digital growth community. It's number one for engagement and yeah, she's got. You know, you you you know, to build a daily pay customer base digitally. 00:31:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 39,000 members and what's the cost? 00:31:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) This one might be her free group, let's see, proven six-figure. 00:31:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) says paid. 00:31:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Where? Right there. yeah, but here, because there's joint group, okay. So, yeah, what email did you use to purchase? Okay, so she's then selling it via sales page, okay. Only how people to pay the joint here, live weekly mentoring support, giving monthly networking events, zero of six-figure online is six months. That's her promise. She looks really good, actually. That's fine, I don't know her name is. Payment methods. Are you saying that? 00:31:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) what's right there. 00:31:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Are you early, 423? And she's new system IO, isn't it, she's system Ha ha. That's her name. And she has any love us? 00:32:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How many do you have math real quick? 39, what was the note was 47? Yeah, so 39,000 times 47. That's 829,000 a month. 00:32:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Holy crap. 00:32:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And it's more than that because it's almost 40,000. 00:32:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So road map to attract daily pay customers digitally, build an impactful email list, create a well-known brand and proven six figures in six months formula. 00:32:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So my thing about wanting to do this stuff together is that both you and I have gone to the point where, and because we can still, like I said, have our separate stuff and feed it so that you're not risking building everything around me. And vice versa, not that I'm even worried about it, but that's just this smart thing to do because anything can happen, right? But the roadblocks that both of us will have, we'll get to them so much faster. We'll doing something together. And I mean, I'm all about leverage. To me, it would be so leverage because we have different skill sets, but we have very similar skill sets too. And one of them is so few people just show up and work all the time. And I don't mean all the time. don't actually work all the time, but I show up every day. I move the needle every day. lot of people, most people honestly, really don't do that. I've worked with tons of people. There's a lot of inconsistency, even with high-level performers, because they burn themselves out. so it cycles a burnout. I don't get burnt out. I don't let burnout happen to me. Because I nap. A lot. I can nap three times a day. I will nap three times day if that's what it takes. You feel good. I take time off. I take little trips like so and I don't work long hours, but yeah, I do show up consistently. I pay for help. I pay for good help. I train good. Most people pay for help. And then they don't train well. And so it's not useful. I'm not getting any help. I dig in and I get to thorough training quickly. Screen sharing, video sharing, then so we're doing it together. I'm showing you and then you tell, you show me that you can do it. And then you go be released to do the work. And we have constant communication and feedback. So like, some people, most people abdicate. 00:34:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I delegate. Yeah. 00:34:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) and they think that they're delegating, but they're abdicating anyway. And now your brain is always considering about marketing and offers. I hate starting there. also, you, yeah, I mean, you just love the part that I like. 00:35:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) to go about a lot. 00:35:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And I think where you have friction is clarity and should it be this or this and also anchoring because if you're trying something every month and that's your habit that I know that it's just your tendency to kind of bounce around. So what you would need support with is how does your spirit get the freedom to explore? Because obviously that's important to you. Without that sabotaging what you're already doing by distracting you too much. You get to play and get that outlet but you've got somebody helping you go okay. Now that you've played you have to make a decision. Do you keep playing there or can you bring something back to here because this is what you chose first or are you switching and if you're switching be real clear about why you're switching and make sure that it's aligning with your values because Sometimes we need permission to switch, and we give ourselves permission, right? Sometimes that's the thing to do too, but that logical conversation, I can have in my sleep. Yeah. You get really clear and really confident and peaceful, because that's the part that slows things down is trying to figure it out, you know, do what I want to do and don't I want to do it. And the usually it's a why, but sometimes that why is not very clear. And so the probing questions that have you get to that why, that's what I'm really gonna add. 00:36:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. Okay. I love based on what we just saw. I think we just have one community that's a little ticket, maybe start at $5 and bring it up to $47 and be like that girl. Like I think we just saw maybe a path. 00:36:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:36:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Sorry. Between the two of us like there's like, yeah, like people get so much value out of it. 00:36:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's what I was thinking something about too is just starting. really level and bringing it up and be like, okay, the price is increasing, the price is increasing until we get to kind of a place where the conversions drop and we keep increasing it. That way we can get numbers in because there's nothing like an empty group trying to talk to an empty group. And then we learn as we grow, but I think that that's the rocket fuel is getting the people to come in and tell us how we can serve them that were already attracted to us for whatever reason at a low level cost. And then we serve them really well and we can let them be grandfathered in or say, you get this price for this next year, but for this year, you know, but next year we're raising prices because in place and whatever, nobody, yeah, groceries don't get it locked in, rent rarely doesn't like occasionally, but most things in class. Yeah. got it. So I think the next steps would be to to kind of create like a very simple map like that, right? what the offer is and what the content would be. So like, I think if I have that profit time, energy maximizer to serve to the community, I feel like you think number one, I feel like I've brought a valuable contribution that earns whatever my low level portion of it is, right? And I'll keep bringing it. You bring something of yours. And but that's impactful that you know that they're going to go. Something is going to be they'll have an aha moment or something tactical that they can implement right away, but not your best stuff, right? And then we just put together an offer put together some graphics and images and start piping people in for $5 the first time for like, and Honestly, we'll see that the issue with school is that there's a few issues. First of all, people can very easily see how much you're making and how much money you have because of how many people are in your group and what your paid price is. Yeah, that's just one thing. Competitors, whatever. There's that. School does pipe people in, but you can only charge one price a month per group. So if you raise the price, you can't let one group. If you charge it through school, so what she did was she charged off-site and let them in for free or however it worked out, but because school only lets you charge one price per person. So if you say it's $5 for you guys, but it's $35 for you guys, you can't do that. 00:39:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) School, I'll let you do that. 00:39:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So anyway... We would just have to figure out the tactical approach around that and she does it, which is charging the money off of school and then letting them into it. 00:40:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, yeah, stuff to think about, yeah, all right, we'll have fun. Okay, you're going to your, your study? 00:40:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, I'm late, it's a missionary training, but they record it so I can still get it. maria@mariagudelis.comTina MarieMaria & Tina🪄
00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hello, how are you? 00:00:12 - Dan Ryan (3) Cleaners day and up on the poetry of my various furry friends. 00:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I like it. 00:00:21 - Dan Ryan (3) Doing calls, doing meetings, look out. 00:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's good, it's good. I got a full night's sleep and groceries just got delivered. My older daughter took my younger daughter to seminary and she's making dinner tonight. And there's a flipping spider on my ceiling. Hopefully I must go with this. A comment? I don't want to get it. I don't like spiders. But I am the only spider killer. I guess you get to live for a while. I don't feel like dealing with it. 00:00:59 - Dan Ryan (3) I don't want to live. 00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's, it's no spiders. Anyway, what, uh, was it a work call you had just now? 00:01:12 - Dan Ryan (3) Two, then I, uh, talked to developers at, uh, SOD at nine, and then I just had a meeting with Circle, because I was like, you know what, I'm going to look at these other community platforms, and I'm officially sold on Circle, Tina. It is. 00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Really? Yeah. Taylor, well, to agree with you. 00:01:35 - Dan Ryan (3) Uh, okay. Uh, probably not for the reasons. I'm sure Taylor really didn't evaluate it and just copy Brandon Burshaw or something. Uh, I'm like talking to the guy like, okay, what if I want to send a, you know, I didn't, I was like, I have a CRM and what if I want to send people over from my CRM? So they're going to opt in. through this lead thing, and that's where I'm going to send them emails, and that's where I'm going to make offers and pitch ship and, right, because they don't really have massive email or whatever. mean, yeah, I don't think they even have it. And I go, and then I want to get them over and I want to tag them with the three things that I'm collecting in the form. He's like, yep, API, don't use apps. I go, okay, great, that could be that. And then I was like, all right, let's say I want to have a free level, and then I want to have different paid tiers. So let's have paid tier one is like a group coaching thing, or whatever, or, or it's one on one coaching, or let's say I want to do a cohort. So there's like a six week cohort. He's like, let me show you, opens up all these sites. He's like, you can do everything you just said. was like, God damn, really? It's like, okay, how do I generate the payment? it's like the payments here. You can make it. a month to month. So you can make it a full page, you can make it a month to month. You've got a link at the end. Okay, so I have that link. So if I'm on a sales call, for example, I can downsell to the page, that payment plan is ID up, and you just send in this link, I know it's in the link through the fee around, I go, okay, what if I want to, what if I want to take, I got this is further down the I go, if I want to take activity from, from circle and update my record in my CRM. So using mom as an example, I met with him and I talked about Ninja and mom. Not so much because I thought I would use it for Ninja, but he literally, the reason I said Brendan Bouchard is because he showed me Brendan's thing. So what they're releasing right now is a headless API, that you can take circle components and put it inside. Buddy balls, basically. So when he opened up Brendan's side, And was like, that's body boss. And he's like, it is? And he's yep. But he's like, well, that's what Brent. And he's like, I don't know who he's doing it for him. But he's like, they're doing it. So see, they had circles just iframed inside body boss, which looked good, as a matter of fact. And but now you can take components, like the feed component, and then have that in there. And your users are in body boss, but you're using circle. And I was like, he's like, so you don't have to pay millions of dollars to develop these widgets, because you can use ours. I'm like, oh, that's dope. I didn't know you could do that. He's like, it's not out. It's coming out like two weeks. He's like, you're just showing me because it sounds like you would get it. I definitely get it. So then Brendan's got someone doing it for him. 00:04:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like, I'm pretty sure I can find out who did that. 00:04:50 - Dan Ryan (3) And then go talk to them. So yeah, I'm like, man, this is high levels. They're never going to catch up. of this. Schools never going to catch up to this. Like, these guys are way, way further ahead. 00:05:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, but I went and just got that snapshot yesterday. 00:05:09 - Dan Ryan (3) That's okay, because I do still think like you could do the sales calls. 00:05:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Wait, you got what's natural? Community one that you showed me. 00:05:18 - Dan Ryan (3) I think that can work. I do think that can work still, but for mom, because mom to me is going to be extremely complicated. So it's going to have, it's going to have all the things that I just said. You want a free tier, then you want a paid tier, then you want a government tier, then you want a dedicated error for fan flow users, then you want a dedicated area for people that are in. But we're, I don't know if this is going to be the name, but we have this continuous release strategy. So it'd be like, hey, no, you're going to pay to be in the continuous release strategy cohort. One, which starts in January, two starts in February 3 starts in March, and in that group, you are releasing a song every 8 to 12 weeks with whoever's in that 20-person cohort, whatever. So those would all need to be separate paid tiers and separate private groups. And I'm like, yeah, so at that level, I love them, right? I don't know. have no idea. 00:06:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think you leave it out with the communities, because if you can't do that, then that would be a deal breaker for me too, because I want multiple tiers. And one thing that Circle can do that I don't know if you came across it, but it gives you stats of who's logged in and what information they've consumed. 00:06:48 - Dan Ryan (3) Yeah, you have to actually build some of that, he showed me that. Yeah. Interesting. The other thing that they have that is perfect for mom is spotify interest. I was like, oh, that's dope, and then they do mp3s, which we need, which high level doesn't support. So I was like, okay, but it's also like, you could do this headless thing and put it inside of high level. I was like, oh, that would be interesting. So you can still use high level and then just have circle inside of high level and he showed me another version of that. And it was just like the E card and he was saying, yeah, if you owe off, he kind of lost me. It was not super off on oh off, but he's like, imagine you just owe off your high level log in that you give them. It's the exact same log in for circles and they log in high level, they log in circle, they just don't know. It's like, yeah, that would be great. So yeah, but I'm not totally sold, but I was like, oh. of this headless API is super interesting. 00:08:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What is a headless API? 00:08:08 - Dan Ryan (3) I mean, it's like you're not you're not using the wrapper, right? So you're not using the container of it of circle. So you're using the compound, you're getting access to the components. You can do with WordPress too. So it's like, it's super lightweight. There's not a lot of other code. It's just a thing. It's fairly new. I hadn't really ever heard. I'd heard of it for WordPress. I had not heard of it for like one of these standalone softwares that was surprisingly said that I was like, oh, okay. I did not see that coming. 00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Interesting. Maybe. Oh, 00:09:00 - Dan Ryan (3) But I'm looking at it more for, because we've been talking to these dudes grooved for the bands. So then I was like, I don't like those guys. And there's no way they're going to catch up to any of these people's school. You know, whether it's school or circle or it might be networks. But these guys are starting out and they're not even called Pepsi Sprite. They're nothing. They're like Fanta. They're never going to. But they're trying to target just musicians. that's sort of the value problem. But tech wise, they're texting. 00:09:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Who's texting? 00:09:45 - Dan Ryan (3) They're called groups. 00:09:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I was like, wait, what is the group? 00:09:53 - Dan Ryan (3) Okay, never run. Yeah, but it's the, it's those, I mean, props. It's those TikTok influencers. They're like, they got so much reach on TikTok. now they're like, oh, we do communities for all audiences. And they've gotten some of the biggest TikTokers to be on the platform. And they're, they're using that to attract other people. But the problem is the software itself stinks because it's a bunch of TikTokers developing software. Like, yeah, it's not good. It's not going to go well long term. 00:10:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think the, um, man, it's always so complex. There's so many things that have to be measured. So like the speed of implementation. So school is super fast to implement. That's really, to me, the only draw about it. There's a lot of drawbacks, including analytics, you have to pay for every community, um, they don't integrate, the communities don't integrate with each other really well, where you could do that with like circle. I think Circle is pretty quick to integrate, but also has a lot of complex features that you could do and it doesn't have a native app, but it does have an app. So that's good. You don't know if it has a magic link, which I think is really good for people that don't want to use the app and just want to be able to go straight to their content without having to log in and remember a password because a lot of people don't use password managers and they don't have an efficient login process. Yeah. But what I'm looking at in this high level community is it is convoluted. That was my issue with high level to begin with is that it's convoluted. It's there's. It's not pointing click. You know what I mean? It's not intuitive. And then same with Buddy Boss was the same thing. 00:11:51 - Dan Ryan (3) So yeah, Buddy Boss is not intuitive at all. 00:11:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) no, you've got to have somebody who knows exactly what they're doing. And that is. 00:12:00 - Dan Ryan (3) Not super easy to come by thing Yeah, what you need is like well, I mean, I think you got right the snapshot for high level is gonna have Hey do this or it's gonna build a bunching for you You would need something like that force you would need something like that for circle too But there's no snapshots right it's gonna be Build and you'd need someone that like he took me in a community that was clearly a coach and then doing individual coaching so like You would have like a damn thing so when I log into circle as like Let's say I'm like so I'm your high ticket level right so it's like you log in I'm high ticket I get access to everything like the courses or all the logs for me, but then I also have a dedicated damn coaching in the area they call it a coaching, but it's not literally the coaching area. And then inside that you could have Dan, Mark, blah, blah, blah, but Mark can't see Dan and Dan can't see Mark. So all I see under coaching is Dan. And then it's a dedicated stream of Dan and Tina. I was like that's interesting not be group. 00:13:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He goes, yeah. 00:13:25 - Dan Ryan (3) Okay, I didn't see I didn't see that coming. I can say in the video, I asked him to send me the recording. 00:13:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's all it's interesting. So what are your priorities for the membership for mom? 00:13:45 - Dan Ryan (3) So I've already proven I can generate a lead for under two dollars. And then they I think like 80% of them opted to join the Facebook group. But now I'm like, okay, I can just force and I can ask them if they want to join the community, if they assent, yes, and I can automatically go create the record in wherever I can do it in high level, I can do it in a circle. So then I go automatically create that record. So I'm not just putting in everyone, I'm putting in all the people that say yes, and then I'm tagging them as whatever, yes. And then the people that say no, I'm tagging them as no to invite them later. And then you would deliver potentially deliver the thing through the group and through email. So they're opting in, think I did two of the things I did, royalty release checklist and I did, no, I'm sorry, did a royalties checklist and then a release checklist. So they could get the thing in the group, or they could get the thing in the email either way. then ultimately they're for each, now we're going to Fletcher, if each thing is actually tied to a course, then you could sell them the course and deliver the course inside wherever, wherever that can be used. Then you have a free community that's just a bunch of people that are in the independent music space. And then I'm tagging them based on the first things that they tell me and then you'd enrich that, we let them enrich that through their profile, right? So the only thing I really ask them on the way in is what are you? And they're either a producer, engineer, an artist, a band, where those options are. So you would immediately be able to identify someone who's a band, come on up on that, possibly genre, and then you'd give them the ability to, hey, this is my Spotify thing. Because part of me has been mutilating, I forget who did this back in the day. I think it might have been Justin or somebody else. But... it was like in the community, they would go juice people's Facebook posts, right? just put up this ad, can you guys go like it? And then a bunch of people would just go like the ad and back at that time, that was an indicator to push the ad further for Facebook. So it was like the community was participating in juicing other things within the community. So my version of it is like, you earn credits. So you can, if you do it, you get a credit. And then you can then, once you have that credit, that credit can be spent when it's time to promote your song. It's like, okay, you have 10 credits, so you can now get 10 clicks. Something like that. So when someone released this song, it's Spotify. It's like, hey, my song's out, Ghost Treatment. That's the signal to Spotify. People are interacting, it's Ghost Treatment, whatever else, whatever the things are. So, or you don't do that. It's just that. community is supporting, right? I came and released this out, and one go go support it. 00:17:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, um, I don't know. They're so whatever. So, the circle has like gamification features in there. I think you're what you were talking about that they do actually. 00:17:28 - Dan Ryan (3) But they have, they have a bad game and stuff, but it's not game. It's not game. It's your, you decide. So you can build an automation in the background that hands out badges and stuff. It's not, it's not like built in. It's your user. So you could be like, completed the cohort completed the course that he showed me that those are these options. Automations that you build. There's nothing made of. That's like, oh yeah, we automatically have this game of occasion component. Hmm. Yeah. 00:18:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, but and I don't know all the different ways that you could do it, but the idea that you have where the community supports each other with those credits for like listening to songs, downloading songs, whatever. I don't know. But I don't know that I heard the answer for like, like, if you were going to rank, first of all, if you were going to list the features that you want and then rank them, but I guess it doesn't matter if you found a solution that does everything that you want, but in the search for things, if you hadn't found everything, I would be curious to know what were the things that you had been looking for. 00:18:56 - Dan Ryan (3) So, was it my list? 00:18:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) it was Marx. 00:19:00 - Dan Ryan (3) So, Mark was always shooting down this or the other so like the last thing he sent was oh MP3 and then not sport it was like do beyond having a dream and like yeah, we do That's kind of a deal breaker for a music community because everyone's dealing in mp3 or mp4 so there's no music no music in bed and and then Circle also just happen on Spotify. was like oh, that's even better But not or not because when you're when you're in the pre-production phase Imagine you're in a group that's producing it while I'm working on a producing a song to be released You can only have mp3s of that while you're saying okay. Here's the first mix. It's gonna be an mp3 It's not it's not publicly available. You could put it on SoundCloud, but you probably don't want to It did have a SoundCloud integration too, which I was like god damn really but So yeah, Mark, it was that and it was he doesn't like when you put a video in, he wanted like a full full video post, I love Facebook and school doesn't do that, high level doesn't do that. So that was more of like just a UI sort of thing. School doesn't do it and high level is copying school, so therefore they don't do it. Circle doesn't. Mighty networks did it. Then as far as like, then there was just having the different, the pride of any sort of paywall, right, so I don't know school has a paywall. So having the free thing and then a paywall. 00:20:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So yeah, I think I like this. It's one or the other. You can either have a free group or a paid group, but you cannot have two tiers. 00:21:00 - Dan Ryan (3) Oh, see, school, you can have like nine, you can have unlimited tears. You mean circle? Um, circle, yeah. Um, and then the main thing he doesn't like about high level is it's built around courses, as opposed to being courses is part of it. So it's not really community, it's courses plus community, and he wants community first, there might never be courses, right? So what if, especially if you're dealing with just a band, a band is never going to have a course ever. Right. So he's like, we tried to, he's actually building community and more on that, um, trying to see how it goes. But that was the main sticking point is that it's like, uh, he's like, no, that doesn't fit for a band. What is a band teaching someone? 00:21:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's like, no, you're right. 00:21:57 - Dan Ryan (3) But I was like, we could use this for mom. He could put our core like it totally fits for forces first teaching first community second, but the this scenario is completely flip-flop. It's community first forces second. like, okay, then it makes sense. I mean, I guess that's probably the best way to look at it is that. Yeah, it's it's it's need community forward, not forces forward. So I like I went through this dude. 00:22:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I took him through like ninja explain what ninja was.-hmm. 00:22:37 - Dan Ryan (3) it was like the ninja falls apart with our MCQ product. He's like, yeah, no. like, you're you'd never be like, he's like, I'm not saying you can't you have developers probably could. But he's like, then that's when he showed me Brandon Bouchard's thing and I said, was like, that's buddy boss. I was like, oh, okay, that's kind of interesting. So we could head this. BPS circle into because I think buddy bosses community stuff stinks It's like oh This could be better And then we can do the stuff like you know, we log them into our MCQ software from within buddy boss They don't know that they left. 00:23:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He's like, oh, never gonna be able to do that Yeah, For me and and and also why which I know you think is proactive avoidance, but for me, it's really it's it's tactical learning Because it's hard for me to comprehend the user experience without having the user experience and Trying to create a list of what are the features that matter most like I can think of some things for me The course is the most important thing but community is really important as well because Because if I can leverage the conversation of other people in the community to kind of create almost like a gravitational pull towards the content, because there's also other people there. but but then you don't even know until you've done it does that work or not, you know, yeah, and so it's all theoretical. And it's just, it's just thoughts upon thoughts upon thoughts until you do it and experience it. And that's the biggest thing is that I, um, whatever, I think if the list of the main things are there, then whatever else trade offs that you make, like, we know nothing's going to be perfect. But as long as the main features that you need are there and they're solid, then, you know, you don't have to move. But if you do move. I don't know, it's a whole nother thing. It's so hard just trying to build on something. 00:25:07 - Dan Ryan (3) And also for you, you're like going top down. You might never get down, right? if you're currently at high ticket. 00:25:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Explain what you mean down. 00:25:17 - Dan Ryan (3) Right, so the opposite would be free low ticket, mid ticket, high ticket, right? And you're at high ticket. So community is really more for the free, right? 00:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's where the community still is going Agreed. 00:25:31 - Dan Ryan (3) So if you had me and Mark and someone's in Quasimodo or whatever that guy's name is, like, if they were all... 00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, wait, wait, who's Quasimodo? I don't know, but the doctor. Oh, Boogie. Boogie. 00:25:44 - Dan Ryan (3) So if like me and Mark, right? If you're trying clients, we're in a community. 00:25:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We're not going to go in the community. 00:25:53 - Dan Ryan (3) No. No, I might go in there, I might go in there because there's something there for me, right? Right. You're like, hey, log in. I need you to log in and watch this video. Like we're going to talk about this next week. Yeah, I'm going to be in there for that. And so there, but there might be some discussion. I could see Mark, you know, Mark loves to talk, right? And me too, right? I might comment back to someone, right, in that context. we're not going to get in this back and forth discussion. 00:26:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, I wouldn't even have my high level clients would never be there. Because first of all, I'm not giving somebody access to all my people, right? And be like, hey, guess what? These are all the people for you to try to coach or something like that. I'm not really afraid of it. It's just kind of the thing that I have embedded in my mind because of the texture. But also, it's super high touch. Like why would I downgrade our interaction? 00:26:45 - Dan Ryan (3) Well, I'm not saying it's to downgrade. 00:26:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So my point was that you have those people. 00:26:50 - Dan Ryan (3) And yeah, you could be like, hey, the stuff's here. And I would go do this thing, right? And then when you go down to the next level, and what is the next level? The next level is like course buyers. Even them, even them, whoever they are, it's not going to be super cheap, but it's still going to be whatever. And a lot of what your stuff teaches them is antithetical to wasting time in the community, right? It'd be like, you need to be in your business. So I don't see you ever going down to this tier where there's like, just community, right? Like, like, what's exactly what's going to happen to my mom? Mom's going to start. We're going to try and turn free people into customers. 00:27:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You're not. No, I am. I am. And here's why, because it's more of a kind of give back type of thing. It's not about the logical approach to getting high level clients, although it does happen because I'm that person. And I've seen other people do it where they go buy the free thing, really high level people and just go like, oh, they know what they're talking about. But then they circumvent it. They don't go by the course or do anything else like that. They're like, hey, how do I hire you, that type of thing. But for me, it's the long term play, right? It's the ascension. It might take two, three, four, five years for somebody to get to, they become a high level client, but I've been teaching them the whole time. And it's also more of instead of having a blog where it's just one-sided and or instead of sending out emails, it's just a content home. It's a content medium source, and that, for me, is more about energy. It just feels like, right? It's not different. Email would work just as well. A blog could work just as well, Facebook just as well. It's just a preference of psychologically what it feels like to put it inside of something called a community. You know what I mean? Yeah. But then are you going to go like live once a week, teeny hours, like, so I'm not doing it by myself. I'm going to do this with Maria. 00:29:10 - Dan Ryan (3) She loves this. This is what I saw in one of groups like, so one of the groups that he showed me was for Alcatraz North, and I might have been with him, to be honest, and that I could see like, you know, their calendar or whatever, what I was going to get. Yeah. So I imagine they are doing that. They're saying, hey, get in on this on a time block freebie. And then, you know, then they're in the community and you go from there. 00:29:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Um, exactly that we, and I've been talking about it with her because, so she bounces all over the place. 00:29:47 - Dan Ryan (3) That's her biggest issue. 00:29:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I hardly noticed that about her. And my biggest issue is I don't want to be on video. I don't want to do all these things, but they're really good at drawing in people fast because you can connect. Now, I don't, it's not that I mind being on video so much, it's just, I don't want to talk to myself or talk to a camera. It's just so weird. And it's so, I'll have human conversations all day long. So I want to have somebody to talk to and do it with, and I want somebody else's brain that I can access frequently. And so, anyway, if we do it with, she needs all the conversation, wants to have all the conversations. And she does marketing, I do business operations, all the mental stuff. So it's a really good blend. And that's been a huge other part of reason why I haven't done this because I'm like, I don't want to do it by myself. I've never wanted to do it by myself. I do enjoy the community. do enjoy people. love teaching, answering questions. don't even mind having live conversat

I'm sleepy, I got up at 5.30, but I'm good.
00:00:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It breaks your throat behind me, I was gonna think, oh yeah, that's funny because you know what honestly I'm just waking up like I woke up early but I feel kind of groggy too but I know I'm getting better and I wrote out instead of reading the Bible this morning I actually just wrote out one of my favorite ones is I can she I just wrote it right but what I'm loving I have this for like seven years I've barely used it I use it for videos for posting videos online and stuff but I have this big it's not it's not your your smaller size I've got I'm just gonna bring it just so you can see the size of it.
00:00:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like yeah, so I'm using Notability and I'm he's not even bigger than mine I've got the iPad Pro and I thought I had the bigger one but maybe they go there.
00:00:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is like the 12.9 inch on a second. Okay, maybe it's my head small.
00:01:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know. No, I mean, I'm Hold on. No, yours looks way bigger.
00:01:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And a little for comparison.
00:01:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This was a pretty big Bible. That's yeah, I mean, this is this is mine with the magic case and stuff. I didn't know they go.
00:01:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They've got that big double point. No, let's see. This is my iPhone.
00:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's 15. See, Jesus, maybe yours is the same size. It's just kind of the optical illusion of me.
00:01:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
When we show you this alert, this is my this is my lock screen.
00:01:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, cool. I love him.
00:01:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know.
00:01:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are you doing on your big old iPad?
00:01:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, yeah, so I have this app called Notability.
00:01:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You ever heard it?
00:01:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm not sure I have actually. Okay. So it's just an app where, like besides just knows the stuff, he didn't get right on it. But what I've been journaling on it, right? So you saw the picture of it from my yesterday, so that's what I was using, you know, I was writing on it. So, and I just grabbed like a template, so it was right, and then what I do is I used to do marketing videos on it, that's kind of what I have it, like yesterday's thing, like I make it in Canva, but then, you know, I put it here, see, and then when I come up, then I might have a graph, but then I can, you know, talk to it, right? Yeah. so here, then I kind of, you know, draw it. So it kind of keeps people's attention, right, when you're drawing on it. And ages ago, I used to use it, I have a stand for it, so I used to put it up here and then just record my videos, and then upload it to Facebook or Facebook ads, whatever. So, of course, video ads made easy, and I was trying to people how to record the iPad or their phone. It's I like drawing. I guess that's why I got the bigger screen probably QA is that way you got the bigger?
00:03:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and that and my older lady eyes. Yeah Yeah, this stage where I wear glasses all the time except for when I'm working on a screen cuz I have to go like this. Yeah, I had coke bottles losses from age seven till 20 Six maybe and I got LASIK But now they're they're starting to disintegrate again and So what happens now do you have to get LASIK together? What do they say to freedom? I would probably really just have to deal with it because what happens when we get older is the muscles start to weaken and So the distance from near and far becomes more difficult But I'm like there's got to be an exercise and everybody's like nope There's no exercise and then I finally saw a video And someone's like, yeah, you just go focus out here, focus in here, focus out there, and keep doing it.
00:04:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
like, that makes sense. So I need to try that. I don't have good eye genes. I'm a little bit the same. look at Lasik, but I've been wearing context, gosh, since I was like 13. And for every step, I don't have to get it. And then now, you know, not only my 50s, I'm like, maybe I'll just wait. But yeah, this is interesting.
00:04:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If there's a surgery I can get, I will do it. I mean, Lasik was really painful, but it's still tolerable. it in the hours later, I had perfect vision, which was amazing because the peripheral, like I get a little vertigo and just oriented with the rims of my glasses. And then my hair and like, there's all this stuff. So I don't have my full peripheral access because of that. And yeah, I think if there's a surgery and also technology keeps evolving so quickly and we will. But because I have a stigmatism, I can't really where contacts, a stigmatism and the bifocal view issues, so it has to be some significant improvement in technology to really help me a lot, or basically get a new cornea.
00:05:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. So that's a high level surgery, and I'm not sure I'm going to go there, and that's not going to go there. don't You're right with technology. Who knows? Five years from now, yeah.
00:05:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So you are, you got a process to try to work on finding your compass, yeah. So sorry, I got a hair in my mouth. Um, we get to talk longer, tomorrow I'd love to just kind of like, hammer you with some questions and go deep, whatever, but for today what I would love to know is, do you feel like, um, you have enough to just keep you focused on
00:06:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
getting more clarity and I like to break things down by the week like if you have an idea like I know what I want to do today I know why I want to do it today my day is full if I get done at the end of the day and these things are done I will have felt like I was on track even if I don't know the big picture I have steps for my now yeah I feel I feel that like I feel more calm or comfortable that I think it's just more about also just taking the action as well to kind of just figure out what what the final kind of compass is right now so so direct answer your question yeah yes I have on my schedule like what I know I need to done today actually want to get your opinion on the power graphic I've started on your your stuff so it's a balance between my own stuff and then also client-like, but I'm really excited about the whole YouTube channel and helping women over in their 40s and 50s kind of reinvent themselves how to start making money online. It's very basic, but I think that's needed and I vacillate between working with beginners versus people for CEOs and already doing really well because I can do both, but I think by doing especially if we've probably come across this a lot for you, a lot of people are scared of getting laid off their executive job, and then how do they do consulting or coaching or do they do a digital offer? That's what I'm sort of playing with and I've got already laid out out of 10 YouTube videos that I want to do, so it's more just starting it and yeah, just kind of going with that. I did have another person reach out to me since yesterday's video. So I said, hey, I once bought left for I kind of thought I could use one more consulting client. So I'm going to probably just quote on something not like huge amount of per month because I don't want. I don't want the responsibility. I love creating. You asked me what brings you joy. I love creating. love low ticket funnels. And I thought, oh my god, I like, yeah, start focusing on that and help me with that. But also maybe make some in advance and flip it, right? Hey, I got a converting offer here. Try some ads for it. already converting. If you have a good back end that this works perfectly for your offer, know, buy this for me for life 15 or 25k, right? So it's done because a lot of people pay 20k to get something done, like, and they don't know if it's going to work, you know? or they're announced as paralysis because I don't to, know, to case really low compared to what, you know, but. uh he's like changed his topic for me three times the last you know 30 days so that's why I haven't started on his because like right when my meet and then we're gonna go with this literally few days later oh no I decided to change my offer I'm gonna do this so best how about we do front in here so I didn't even respond to him he's in front of my dude I didn't even respond to his last text when he said oh I'd rather do this of like I'm gonna come full service and no we decided on this you need to stick with it because you're going or you can pay a new price because I've already started this so if that's that important to you we're renegotiating that's a new contract that's a new price yeah your indecision is not my obligation is not my responsibility is is not anything we had an agreement you renegotiating opens my renegotiating so either we're done and I'm paid by or if you want help the price that you pay for your uncertainty is your
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
delay, but also my fee, because your uncertainty is not my burden.
00:10:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I like that. That's good. Yeah. Oh, and then other things besides business, like, because I know a lot of it's about self-love, self-care, my nails done here straight. So, oh, you're both red. Yeah, I noticed that. And next week, I'm going to go get my hair highlighted, because I just, you know, everyone will feel good when we're doing that.
00:10:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:10:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I just have to figure out some of my office space since, like, I sprained my knee, and it's kind of hard to go up and down stairs when my office was. So, I'm right here, my living room, and I did bring my soft box lighting down to record part of the video yesterday. So, I'm kind of getting settled in on that. So, I think I'm making movements on that too.
00:10:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah. Yeah, it's the environment makes a big deal. When I go into the bathroom and I see myself and my hair looks dull and my energy. my color looks dull. I don't really wear jewelry because I can't.
00:11:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would. I love sparkly.
00:11:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love sparkly beauty. The beauty of the earth, the beauty anywhere, energizes me. I think it does that to everybody. look at beauty and you just, whether it's the ocean or the sunset or whatever, beauty is powerful. Sometimes people use it really superficially, but I think that there's something to be said for like even in Adam and Eve, we're in the garden of Eden and it was perfect and God said, go dress this garden.
00:11:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, you made it perfect.
00:11:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You want me to go do something to improve it? Like, improvements upon what we have is part of the plan to always, you know, all of these things. so if we are continually improving our environment, I'm adding more light, light. or color, for me, lights a big deal.
00:12:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't have enough windows, I'm depressed.
00:12:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If everything is really dark, I'm depressed. Yeah, so it's a big deal. So you going and doing that, creating the content, just pondering on your compass. For me, I call it an anchor because my compass is more a moral compass, it's my values.
00:12:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And that can't be somebody else or something else.
00:12:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is my own personal values, but my anchor that everything is attached to is God. It's that I have a Father and a Heavenly Mother. And I want to be like my Heavenly Mother and I want to be like them. And I love them and I want to honor them and I don't want to hurt their children, even if their children are really mean and horrible to me, I have to remember that hurting them is hurting him. And so I have, you know what I mean? Like I just thinking about those things. um actually creates my values and my compass comes from that but I don't I personally just don't think of it as my compass I think of it as my my center um maybe like the pole which my compass operates like it's my north pole kind of thing yeah yeah so but additionally you're you agreed to show up to talk to me every day so yeah for me I did this with you I got two other women that I will speak with weekly nobody else daily yeah but but I put that into my life um the exercising my mission and just all these little things and I draw a little bit of energy from it but the social part of it though especially the women yeah because we tend to encourage each other and also we catch each other if we're playing small yeah or you know if we're dealing with somebody who's a using us. And then, you know, that word gets thrown around very loosely, but tab using just means using poorly. It doesn't mean that you're baiting us. It doesn't mean that you're a terrible horrible man. But to pay for your time and to make an agreement and then to add more work on it because somebody changed their mind is abusing. It's not using you as a grade-upon outside of, you know. So I built things like that into my life so that I don't keep having it. You're building that. One way or another, things are going to just improve because of the compounding effect of the environment that you're creating and the energy that you're improving. So it's awesome. love how simple it is. And again, that's like a fundamental principle, right? It's just improve your environment. It's what you're having showing up in your life consistently and things just get better.
00:14:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh yeah, yeah, exactly. yeah, so like I yeah, so Oh, feeling good. You know, I know, um, as part of, uh, sort of into searching around my mom as well. And, uh, There's a little bit of codependency between us, right? You know, so, so even though I love spending time for, I can't spend every single minute of like a lunch or dinner with her because then I'm the crutch to her and she needs to start socializing on her own. So I kind of had that realization, like even like she's funny, called this morning. My brother was there on, can you stop by? was way to work. And so he picked up and said, I'm glad you're there. And they said, yeah, I brought my Macapuccino. So cool. And then, and then, and then, and then when I talk to my mom, So will I see you today? And I'm like, well, no pause there. And then you also have, we have one girl a week that comes and takes her shopping to her favorite grocery store and all this stuff, like the three hours spent time with her. And, uh, I said, no, you're seeing Lisa today. And will I see you tomorrow? Like she wants every day. And I said, well, we'll see, mom. But, um, you know, so, so that was a big, I mean, sort of realized that a while ago, too, because I know my sister even said she lives in five hour flight, but she said, you two really could pet her on each other, like she's come to, like, like literally, if I don't call her for a couple days, when I was sick about a while ago, I love five voicemails from her. But yeah, where are you? But yeah, when you come by, or if we could bring some orange juice to you, like, so it's adorable. But at the same time, I know that she's got a fly on her wings, too, and not just depend on me. So, because she's got a lot of friends, does art tomorrow afternoon for art friends. Like, got a lot of activities. I just don't want her, um, I guess what I'm saying is it was just a good realization and me encouraging her, because when she called me, why don't you call so-and-so your friend? Why don't you call, you know, this person, like, so I'm, you know, it's just, it's just a place that I'm co-hosting her, you know, it's that ever, it's that question of what's, what does she want? I still feel she'll be better socializing in a retirement home, but I also have to let go of the wheel and let her decide that, you know, that's the thing, yeah.
00:17:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Really tough. The one thing, especially working on my psychology classes is studying the difference between individualistic cultures and collectivist cultures, like Japan, China, Eastern cultures, African cultures, they're collectivist. They are more about the collective group and the community rather than the individual. The individual isn't lost though. It's just that we all are part of each other and we have, you know, Latinas are multi-generational houses and nobody calls that codependent because it's called family. And the thing about this individualistic culture I feel like there's a lot of the adversary of Satan, darkness that tries to pull families apart and cause it pop culture and psychology and says dependency. And so I would say trust your heart and your feelings. I do think we all need to work on our socializing. I think that our happiness is attached to a single other person, whether it's a spouse or a child or a friend or whatever. I think that's too much burden. I think that we're supposed to have bigger communities. But I do think that it is really a dark and poor thing that we have called it individualistic and independent and separated ourselves from each other. The happiest and the most, the longest living cultures have three or four generations in their house. They don't lock their doors, their windows are always open, nobody calls that codependency, they live the longest. I don't think it's Italy, but it's in that area. Yeah, so I would say that you have a very strong heart, and I think that that is what your compass is, your love and your heart. I think your love is. I think the reason you thought it was your dad was because you loved him so much, because he had so much of your heart. But really, I think it's your heart. I think your heart tells you what is true, I think that when we feel lost, we look for guidance, and I think we have to be very careful to not just who we look at, but what is the why behind it. solid are they in their compass? how happy are they? How happy have their decisions made them? Do they have a lot of love in their lives? Do they have really loving relationships? Are they complaining about other relationships a lot?
00:20:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do they feel bitter and angry?
00:20:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you're going to take advice, take it from advice from people who are happy, who are centered, who are peaceful. Yeah. But yeah, so it's a hard thing. for sure need to be able to have our own identity that just is us. But part of us is part of other people. Your mom still has your cells in her body. She is attached to you. It's tethered. It's not, she's not a friend. She's not, um, yeah. Anyway, just, just something I've considered, you know, my mom was really, really abusive to me. We aren't close, but I a thing about her every day, I want to get to the point where I can buy her as she wants a traveling van or an RV and just to be free and go wherever she wants to go. She'll never be able to do that for herself. And so my goal is that in five years, I can make that happen for her.
00:21:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:21:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Along with the ability to help her sustain that and but I'll only do it if she will agree to join groups where she can travel into other people. Because we don't have a kind of relationship where we can live together. Although I would and I don't plan on having a set house, plan being portable, mobile and going out anywhere. Otherwise I would make a place for her that was close to me even though we don't get along well because I think that that's how important it is. And God told us honor your mother and father that they days may be long upon the earth. And here's the thing that people never quote this by the way, but they also say parents provoke not nice children. and unto wrath lest he esteem thee as thine enemy. Always talk about honor your parents, but they don't talk about the parents role, too, honor their children. Anyway, some sort of thought as you're going through this, think adding the friends and the community is great, but if you just love being with your mom and it brings you, she's not gonna be here forever.
00:22:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, I know, yeah, yeah. So I'm not gonna live in my house here, but with the dog and the cat, the dog's 85 pounds, and I'm scared. Yeah, knock your mom over. Yeah, yeah, it's little dangerous for her. Yeah. And she does like her own place. She likes her own solace. And then she's an artist, too, so she likes, yeah, that's why she was no, like, she even freaked out us hiring Lisa to spend three hours of her every Tuesday, who's a retired nurse and perfect for her, right?
00:22:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My mom's a retired nurse, you know? Strong woman, huh?
00:22:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So yeah, no, thank you for that. That's that's that's And also, because yeah, Lithuanian is the sense is my mom and dad were born Lithuania, even though they met in Canada when they were, you know, in their 20s. But like our East European heritage, like typically, yeah, the parents live with the kids, you know, like, like my dad's sister had my dad's, actually they live side by side, they had two little houses side by side, you know. And so, but no, my mom's funny.
00:23:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's like, no, I love that. I'm really excited about tomorrow, because I want to ask lots of questions, but I'm also really excited.
00:23:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
would love to see the power wrap right that you started. Yeah, I mean, it's, it's, it's not like, what do you call a, it's important just to be very simple about it, but I like it like the start of it. That's, that's kind of it. Oh, did I send you what Maui made? You sent me the Canva presentations.
00:24:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. I get to send this to you because I have a graphic sky. You're going to be annoyed that I've worked with for like 10 years. He's from the Philippines and I was like, I told him I was going to have it and want it. But I wasn't ready for it yet. But he's like, here, man, I already got to start it. I was like, Maui, I didn't even give you instructions yet.
00:24:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But this is what he made.
00:24:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I sent you on Facebook because I don't know how to download it from here. Oh, you sent me on Facebook? Hold on. Hold on. I will screen share with you. You're going to laugh. I think you're going to laugh. Watch this.
00:24:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's good too.
00:24:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's beautiful.
00:24:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I like it. Yeah.
00:24:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Why is there an iced tea? either. No, he is a goofball. I don't know.
00:25:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And he's generous. She got a dick in it. It could be coffee too. But yeah, he's really good.
00:25:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
By the way, you're graphic. he's he's wonderful. Um, he's got three daughters and a wife there in the Philippines. And he's respectful, so kind, works quickly. Very humble. Yeah, I love, I love the Filipino people.
00:25:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They're very good people. Well, I love it.
00:25:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, God. So any updated this spreadsheet for me too? Is this the right one? No, that's not the right one. Let's see if I can get animation of open client stuff.
00:25:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:25:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I was like, Maui, can you go take, you know, put it in a spreadsheet? So like, I want to improve how this looks a little bit better. So I was working on that. The other thing, is this the right thing? Did you happen to take a look at this?
00:26:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, I know you told me about it this morning, but I haven't had a chance yet, but I will this afternoon.
00:26:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Um, I wondered if it might be helpful.
00:26:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It would take a whole, probably five minutes. I don't want to, but if I just read it to you.
00:26:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. how it flows because the difference of the text versus like my voice is the difference, right?
00:26:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, yeah. Yeah.
00:26:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. I'm gonna get my water.
00:26:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I got.
00:26:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Um, probably needs to work on this, but anyway. All right. Hey there, genius. I know you're a genius because you just chose a path of working so much smarter. You don't know me yet, but you're going to learn very quickly that I am hyper excited about what I do. Part of that might just be the H and the ADHD, but I don't it. And what I can tell you is that if you're a person who's also struggled to focus, you are going to love what I teach you if you're willing to suspend your irritation.
00:27:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
about doing organizational tasks, everything I have ever done since high school has been around getting the greatest results from the least amount of effort.
00:27:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not because I'm lazy but because I despise waste and I have finite energy and only 24 hours a day and only a handful of those really spent on what matters to me. I want an amazing life and I figured out how to create that for myself. Along the way I figured out how to help people who have totally different values and mental processes do the same. The exercise you're about to go through has been life-changing for so many. It is deceptively simple. It looks like an ordinary spreadsheet but and I need you to really hear me on this. Pretend that the spreadsheet is like Clark Kent. It only looks like a nerdy news reporter but in real life it's a superhero. I first had people go through this exercise 12 years ago under another program called My Freedom Systems. I have been delighted to learn that this exercise alone own was deemed worth the price of my full course at that time. And not only that, but 12 years later, these principles are still just as useful and valuable in helping people make the most amount of money with the least amount of time and stress. I'll give you two other examples of how this exercise impacted two very different people. One, a voice coach and a musician who hated numbers and all things administrative. By the way, I have yet to meet a business owner who liked the advent and stuff, but she trusted me and so she did the exercise. When she finally finished the work, she immediately saw how she could reach her goals exponentially faster. I'll link her testimony below if you want to hear from her. She wanted to buy a ranch to foster children and teach music and she got there three years early. In fact, I just got the sweetest message from her on my birthday, a video of her on a ranch inviting me to come visit. When I tell you I'm different, but I can get two results.
00:28:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I hope that you will trust me just enough to try this for yourself.
00:29:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll also tell you got a doctor client in mind who just this week just did this exercise and how it flipped what he thought he knew about his business. He has multiple businesses with varying degrees of effort and profit margins. He was 1000% positive that one particular channel was the most profitable turns out. Another part of his business actually makes him $1,666 more per hour than the one that made him the most amount of money. So by switching five hours a week from one business to the other, he will make over 86. No, I'm actually did that math. It was like 430,000 more per year.
00:29:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
told you my math.
00:29:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, 430 half a million dollars almost more. This is why you're such a genius because you're going to learn in just a few minutes, what wasn't taught in medical school and isn't taught how to be anywhere else, including business schools, but in tiny corners of the world where some someone nerdy like me figured out how to do some awesome math and you stumbled into one of those corners. You may not know how to make. But you may know how to make money, but if you do not know what to do to make the most amount of money in the least amount of time in your own business with your own skill sets, then you might be spending more time in low profit activities and cutting your earning power in half or more. That is what this exercise is going to reveal. I'm not going to teach you how to make money. You should not be here. If you don't already have a business that generates money. What I am going to show you is how to leverage your time according to your skills and your existing business. You will discover ways to improve things according to your own values, skills, and resources.
00:30:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
There is nothing magic here, even if it feels like it is when you're done.
00:30:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What I will help you receive is clarity. That clarity will move you like few things ever have and you will do it with so much confidence. Do the work. Tell me your mom that you can't.
00:30:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Ready to see? Let's go. I love it. Love it.
00:30:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's perfect.
00:30:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yay! I love it I love it um so like when you do that video do you um do you do do captions underneath or are you gonna just let like we can do everything what I'll do is I'll start it first I think you should have captions because the study that I read is that people are watching videos at work or they can't listen and they want to consume the content so you need to make it so that they can consume it on mute wherever they're at whenever they're at perfect I also think maybe popping up some little emojis some little like one or two pictures of what it looks like or little things just the the engagement right so it's not just my face and just the words because we do have that ADHD but also if it's done right they reinforce the message your graphic artist seems so good if you give them the script you might come up with a few things things to keep me.
00:32:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's that's a great idea. I don't have a video editor. But you know, what I should do is talk to him and see what kind of because I don't because I pay him hourly. And if he's got a slow machine and stuff, I'm not I don't I don't want him to do that. But yeah, I would love to be able to give him more consistent work. So I will see if he wants to get into some super simple video editing.
00:32:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, good idea. I'm like using CapCut or VDDIO. We have our guy. He's not as creative or didn't he doesn't listen to my instructions. So we have him back on Pinterest. But we did I did train him on these CapCut and how to do stuff. So he was able to do it for the Philippines. just though he thought he could do a lot more other things besides what I asked him to do to a video.
00:32:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, what are you doing?
00:32:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so yeah, but no, no big deal. But anyways, yeah, that could be cool. But
00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that's perfect like and that's huge about the doctor and meaning like oh my gosh I was like do yeah like this by the way is paid for my coaching for years if you actually implement what I've just taught you a five hour shift each week yeah the problem is that the business model he has has limitations to how much he can do and grow but but he had no idea he was 100% sure it was yeah I feel like it's got to be more than that I've got to do the math hold on a second that's huge no really huge what's tall well congratulations that's a big win so I get up with all the time Maria that's what these things do wait we do what sorry this activity that's what it does this happens all the time that kind of revelation that can result in millions pretty quickly if I'm working with high-level people and for low low where I don't say low level people, but lower earning people. What happens is that clarity confidence, which reduces stress. It reduces their mental friction every day. So even though they're not making as much money fast, I removed a huge burden. This, this is normal, like getting massive cause as normal anyway.
00:34:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, when I like about it, too, is that like even for me, like, even though, yeah, I still figure out the exact offer and, you know, what business I want to have over the next, you know, year, five years, even 10 years out. Um, but what do I do now? Like just doing that activity is like, regardless, like I was doing nothing to build my audience, like it was, it was like crazy and a lot of shiny object syndrome, you know, not going lie, like, oh, yeah, want to research YouTube videos and before I know it, I'm two hours into it. It's like, no, it didn't need. So it was interesting. was really good for me to go, okay, if I want to make money, I better start showing up more, period. like even if I haven't figured it all out yet, just show up more because I know that I used to teach people, hey, more lives you do the more money you make, you know.
00:35:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and you have way to capture the people that show up, like you have an offer to make because showing up doesn't do any good if you don't offer to drive them to follow up sequence to continue to nurture them to ascend them. So, you know, that's a big conversation. But yeah, for sure, I'm glad that that was insightful for you.
00:35:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, how can I just, I know we're supposed to get going because we want to keep this short, how can I help you get this low-tech offer off the ground? Because originally, typically I do the graphics, but you kind of had a guy do it, which is amazing, right? go with that. do you do you drink coffee, right? you drink coffee? Oh, you don't?
00:35:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
then keep it as the iced tea. I don't drink iced tea either.
00:35:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So yeah, but typically, like I kind of put it up on like a could funnel page or something and and the person then imports that into their click funnels, or they if they have goal level, they import there. I'm looking at system I own myself because I got pissed off at active campaign tripling the price of my service. Yeah, they do a lot changes and they change plans and it's like my bill tripled. I like what are you guys doing them? So they're because they added AI in it and they added the sales pipeline management to it, but I don't want those features. So yeah, so anyways, so a lot of people I know are starting to use the system. But yeah, what can I do to help move the little ticket offer forward?
00:36:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I got decided to use Wordpress and Elementor and funnel kit. And this is a landing page that I liked the template of and that's really too much for a this low ticket offer, but it's very easy to pick and choose a few things from here and then got everything else. And with funnel kits, they have really simple, and I didn't know she'd done this, a good job for her. Really simple stuff. mean, this looks like an onter page, really, this is the basic template for an onter page also. So really, I feel like I get the copy in my sales letter. The things that need to happen is ads follow up sequences. I don't know, you know, you've already has your offer and you know what you're do, you do, but any first of all, any just kind of directional support saying, okay, this is what we need to do next. Let's set a date, let's set a time. Giving feedback on the copy is amazing. But, you know, I haven't run ads in, I mean, 12 years.
00:38:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:38:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
still think that I could do amazing at it, but I don't want to. I want to serve my clients. I want to create the content. So whatever I can tap other people's brains for and pay for or exchange, you know, my services for. Or that's what I want to do because, and this is what I teach everybody is the more types of work you do, the more friction you create because of the, yeah, get out of flow of, you know, if it's analytical, if it's creative, if it's administrative, all those different types of things, it takes a while to shift from one to another. And so I want to minimize the shifting and the only way that I can do that will the best way for me to do that, especially with the minimal amount of time that I'm that I want to work. And so that when I do what I do, I do it at the highest level is by using other people for the other things. Now, I'll probably always tweak some copy and be like, oh, let's do this. Let's do that a little bit. So I feel like I'm pretty good at copy and psychology and persuasion. But any help in the creation or suggestions or, hey, you should probably have a seven day follow up sequence for this. And maybe these are the bullet points or these are things. Anything that reduces my mental load by zooming me into the next step a little bit closer, just because I can get there doesn't mean that it doesn't help lift my burden.
00:39:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, have a good like a typically I deliver the load ticket off where there's like a little Google slide presentation and it's like maybe some suggestions templates for the abandoned cart email series. Wait, if you're using this template, is there an Abandoned carts. Do they first click a button and enter the email to get to the order checkout page? Initially, it's not a deal breaker at by any means.
00:40:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, no funnel kit. Let me go Abandoned card to see what Google tells me Captain V. It's boost orders time. follow up some brothers. I don't know They probably your sales page example again.
00:40:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
me see what happens when they click the button to buy it That you're this one. Yeah, when they say get in there what happened? Oh, it takes right there Okay, so there's two choices You could just take them right there and we just test that out And then the next choice can be when they click that button kind of frank hernsel They enter their email not their name or anything else. They're just their email to then get to this page So then there's an automation that we can run that checks after life say 15 minutes Then they buy or not and if they didn't buy then typically a three email Series that's called a band and cart where it's like hey notice you Didn't check out finish your checkout process, you know, did like get in the way and you can include your customer testimonial, come back and buy it. But it's not critical because I just saw today, I was talking about lady that has a $77 frontend offer teaching people how to become fractional consultants. And she uses a Sam cart and she has no band cart and yet she's converting at 5%, which is really good for a $77 offer. So, you know, we could start with this first and then see what the conversion rates are and then go from there.
00:41:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I like that. And also, I've got my dev girl putting in Google Analytics on there to make sure that we can track all of that.
00:41:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, beginning. Another note, like, I think you and I talk about this. Do you, are you going to start a YouTube channel?
00:41:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I know. I mean, I know that I mean, all of my business has been a word of mouth and it's always also and the way people I've had people recommend me who've never even worked with me because of my Facebook posts. So my content is powerful and it wasn't even video. I can't even tell you how many times I've been told you should write a you should do a podcast, you should be on video, whatever. So I know that I need to do that and I know that YouTube is the king for lower cost leads. You tap into the SEO power there as well. So yeah, I would want to create the content for YouTube and repurpose elsewhere rather than the other way around.
00:42:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, and I'm kind of attacking that strategy too. So I just because Facebook's good and ads are good, but it's just it's when you turn ads off for whatever reason that all of a sudden it's nothing, right? get no more traffic. Whereas YouTube, some of my friends that have started their YouTube tube channel even a couple years ago, they're still getting traffic from something from three years ago a video they did, right?
00:43:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, what do we think about this over the other one? With the express checkout option up there versus this? I love when these things are up at the top, especially if there's Apple Pay. Should I do that?
00:43:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah, because they already saw the sales page you clicked to buy, but go back to the top then again.
00:43:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can get rid of most of the stuff.
00:43:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, that's very simplistic and yeah, that's fine. Let's see what that's there. It reminded me a little But what Shopify looks like, and that's kind of why I was thinking maybe subconsciously, that's a good thing. Yeah, anything that is familiar. Yeah, like the top part necessarily, but that part there. Right. Shopify sometimes, you know.
00:44:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but just replace this with like a purple strip. What is Shopify as a blue or purple? I don't remember.
00:44:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
think it's purple. Uh, well, it depends on if someone changed the cart, because the standard one, I think, is just white with your logo will be on the top left, right?
00:44:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I think this will probably be better. Sorry, and that's the thing, I think, too, that will be great about our short calls is that, so when we get clarity on what are the steps, be like, okay, what did you do? And then like, okay, well these are the things I have to do, but I'm not sure if I should do this or this or This or this? Yeah, I think that is going to become a very big part of the conversation, probably for both of us. I was thinking this, I was thinking this, here's my criteria, got anything to add to it to help me kind of like narrow it down. And then obviously we make our own decisions, but that feedback with somebody who understands all the nuance of the decision is super helpful. And then, okay, cool, then I'm not gonna sit with that all day going should I do that?
00:45:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Should I do that?
00:45:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that little echo is just enough. And even if it's wrong, it doesn't even matter if it's wrong. Sometimes just hearing something back gets us to take action. We learn if it's right or wrong through testing.
00:45:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:45:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're never going to guess everything correctly. Our opinions don't really mean anything. But we use them before we activate ourselves into action. Yeah. so anyway, but I think that I'll get inhabited being much faster with that kind of stuff and like.
00:46:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anyways, anyway, cool. Love it. Okay. Wow. Let's go Have an amazing day. All right. See you.

00:00:10 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Good.
00:00:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. good. So it'll just be us, not Patrick today, because he's on vacation and he just messaged last night about it.
00:00:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:00:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's all you, all the focus on you today.
00:00:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Nice. Sorry.
00:00:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How, how was it gone since last week? Any thoughts and ponderings about what we talked about before we get to like the tasks and assignments?
00:00:47 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, I just kind of went ahead and did it. I met with all my team members one on one.
00:00:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tell me about that.
00:00:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, it went well. Had a. Very well, you know, the whole reason I wanted to do it was to me with a very anyway, but she ended up being sick so I didn't get clearance of this morning It was good I got some good feedback the way I structured it I kind of like Asked them how they were doing and of course they gave me the generic answers, you know pretty good or you know Happy or whatever and then I got a little further asked them what their biggest stress was Right now and I got some good answers and then So usually it was like on the client side and then as I gave it we discussed that different solutions we could come up with and Then asked them, you know, what about the firm from the firm side you're experiencing stresses that I could help you relieve or any anything that we can do. so I got some good feedback on that as well. And then I set some goals with them. I wanted to have three goals for the next month for each one of them. So we set some goals. And then for coaching, I finished with coaching points. I just kind of went through a couple of things I noticed, but it kept it really positive.

So what I would love to do, what I think would be super insightful and helpful, is just to go over those in details for you to share what it was like, what you learned, your read on them, how they felt. Because like I said in the beginning, it's really an information. gathering process. So, basically, imagine you have, have you ever played with Legos? Okay, so you're dumping out all the Legos and you're basically taking inventory, and let's say you're doing something where you're just building it from your mind, not necessarily from a plan or schematic, and so you're figuring out what you've got to work with, so you can kind of build in your mind first, knowing what pieces you're working with. So, you know, some of the pieces are the people, but inside the people, so let's say the people are colors, and one's red, but there's different shapes of red, and one's yellow, but there's different shapes of yellow, and each of the different shapes would be their different skills, talents, abilities, weaknesses, any of those things, right? So, we're really just figuring out what do we have to build with, and it will be the people and all the nuance inside of them, and then it'll also be, obviously, the combination, like, where. not just building a red thing or a yellow thing, but so if we're, you know, we could do that together so that we're leveraging, you know, both of our different skill sets and see what we can come up with. What you think about that?
00:04:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I think be great. Yeah, I think initially, you know, I was a safe space. know, I wasn't like evaluating him for their next raise or anything like that.
00:04:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure.
00:04:39 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
But I think, yeah, that's what that's where I want to go. I want to be able to use these one ones as like, you know, a growth audience experience.
00:04:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel like um, very was a little bit more open this time with that intention that you set? Do you feel like she
00:05:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
end up at all more than normal. Yeah, a little bit. So, you know, what, it was a little bit different with her because I knew that that was one of the points we have touched on last last time we met. And so I made sure to emphasize the fact that, you know, this is a safe space, you know, I know that, you know, you know, I worked and passed four terms where anytime you were a little bit vulnerable, that was used as to, you know, those weaponized against you, then down the line. And I wanted to make sure I wanted to make clear that this wasn't this. This was just a way for me to, to be in touch with her and understand how I could support her, how I could help her. Set goals and how I could make sure she was happy here. And so you said that explicitly? Yeah.
00:06:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how did now reading both energy expression and words, how was that received?
00:06:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I could like, I could see her body language, she relaxed a lot more.
00:06:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She is way more like, almost like her shoulders when come up here. It's like down here is choosing. You know how big that is for that to happen. So you know what that means is that she trusts you that what you say is true. Yeah, she had an immediate response. What you said she trusted. That's, it's really important for you to understand that, that how to forgive me. Sometimes I get emotional when I think about people and our hearts and our spirits. and the things that we're going through because we are we are people and this is a big deal and our fears are a big deal our traumas are a big deal and they show up everywhere they show up in the workplace so when a person by default does not feel safe for them to come into contact with a person who can tell them they're safe and they believe it that is very powerful and I want you to remember what I told you about how you can be a different person for these people do you remember what I told you about yourself? I remember we talked about how I could be the safest person to these people because you are safe because you are kind because you do care um not Not because you just want to be that way, but I was pointing out to you that you actually are that way. And so what I want to show to you is now you've received a validation that is in Tina's just making an opinion and she doesn't know me, but she's guessing that these things. You just got validation from somebody that you've been working with, because that physical symbol of shoulders dropping and you can see that she relaxed 100% validates what I said is that you are perceived as safe. However, what I want you to also understand is that a lot of times we can do things somewhat obscurely and meaning that it's not crystal clear. Obviously, I know you know what obscure means, but I want to elaborate on my meaning. You can get a sense of something that you haven't dug into. you. So you haven't specifically identified it and brought it into crystal clear view. For example, Viri could may have sensed that you're a safe person, but you didn't give a clear enough signal to her to say, I am a safe person. I want you to feel safe. And so she felt it, but she didn't believe it per se. And generally speaking, we can feel safe around people, not know that they're safe for a very long time. And especially if you have the experience that you have trusted people in the past, and then they haven't been safe, you're going to doubt that your perception is accurate anyway. So she was able to pair her internal and intuitive perception of you being safe with your words confirming it. she believed it immediately. Hence, the physical experience and vision. visual symbol that she had relaxed and leaned into her the little bit. Does that make sense?
00:10:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, yeah.
00:10:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I want you to understand how powerful that is, because if you know that about yourself, Lorenz, then, but also if you know that there are people like Viri, and there's many, many, many, many, many of them, the majority, who don't feel like people that they are supporting that too in any kind of way are safe, who may not feel like men in the workplace are safe, or any of that, that you can give them a clear signal, I'm safe for you. I want you to feel safe. How you feel is important to me. want you to communicate what you need, what you think, It matters to me. I value your opinion. I value your presence on the team. I value, I mean, it could be your children. It could be other people in other places in your life. But you have because you are kind, because you care, but also because you're intelligent and because you have a good work ethic. That makes you rare. That's not the average person, friends. I've worked with so many people and I was just born weird watching people and intuitively recognizing them. I had grown people speaking to me as a child, forgetting that I was a child, talking to me and unburdening.
00:11:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, I'm not normal either.
00:11:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I've learned to recognize people and I speak boldly because I'm open to the fact that that I could be wrong, but I haven't been yet, and I won't be surprised when I am, well, I probably will be surprised when I'm wrong, but not because of me, but because of people and because of patterns and because of consistency. People really do give a lot of signals.
00:12:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's just most people aren't looking for them.
00:12:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm always looking for them. That's part of my bad for me, have actually become a superpower, which is actually true for a lot of people.
00:12:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So anyway, that's just all that interesting talking to you because like as an introvert, it's sometimes hard for you to express what I'm thinking, but it sounds like you're kind of like you can kind of interpret it before I can get the right words out.
00:12:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And it may not surprise you, but that's actually, I think it's probably one of my favorite gifts. And I get told that a lot is that there are things that people think. And they maybe have never even put it towards themselves yet. But I say it and I'm like, Oh, that's exactly what I was thinking. Or that's what I was feeling or like I had that awareness or whatever. So what you gave to me, even though I've already received it, it always helps me to receive that validation. So what I'd like you to keep in mind too, is that you have the ability to give validation to other people as well. And to take it when you receive it, because that is it's power. It gives people more confidence when they get a clear signal that this is true. So do you re needed that you gave a tour? And she gave you a clear signal of what I told you is that you are uniquely considered safe and trustworthy. So Oh, you told her you were safe because you were already received as trustworthy, she believed it. So those are two signals about yourself that were really important to receive. And I promise you, she's not the only one that thinks that. So that's really important and awesome and good job. Like, I didn't think that would be that fast, but that's how great you are. it does me no good to patronize or placate people. Anyway, if that would be counterproductive, I'd be out of a job very quickly because it'd be the emperor has their clothes.
00:14:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You know what I mean?
00:14:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So I really, I really am impressed that you were able to have one conversation and watch shoulders drop. That specific signal is really, really potent. Wow, I also couldn't even like apply on the wall and watch that happen. That'd be amazing. Okay, so go ahead.
00:15:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It was pretty, you know, a pre rewarding conversation. think she's, you know, she has so much to bring to the team and I've been frustrated with, you know, not being able to suss that out. I'm excited for the next few weeks to see how she kind of grows and is able to kind of trust me as an attorney and can bring her own input to our team.
00:15:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. I am so excited about that also, but I want to remind you, though, that she will need the consistency. So she'll need those signals again and again and again, because a lot of times people will declare who they are with their words, but it's when they support what they declare through their actions that we really know for sure. And I'm sure that you've already told her, like I said, she probably sensed it. This was just. the confirmation. But my point is that you'll want to reiterate that either explicitly or implicitly in the conversation that you have, even just saying things like, I'm so glad that we're opening up a little bit more and talking because I value what you say, just moving right along. not having to make a big thing about it, but a tiny little signal that I met what I said, this is on my mind, this is real, you know, let's keep going. And when she does say something, and it was, you know, more than what you would have expected before, I was just like, wow, I'm so glad that you're sharing more because I really feel like I'm, you know, from your mind and your experience. And, you know, just little signals like that, sincere, obviously, but I know that they will be. So then not only will she just continually be open but that should probably spread to other so if anybody else is needing anything and you say hey guys I need you to open up more a little bit and maybe Viri speaks up and goes yeah I did and it was awesome you know yeah super excited about this you're awesome good job good job good job and you just got right on it I love that and I love that you're all stealthy like I'm gonna talk to Viri but I don't want her to feel worried so I'm gonna talk to everybody well yeah I think you know the other interviews were good in their own rights for different reasons but Viri was the principal target yeah yeah but but you put in the effort to go through the whole thing first of all to consider and to not want to make her afraid and so to take time to talk to everybody which obviously is a benefit and wisdom anyway but that's the difference between bosses and leaders Lorenz and you just do it it because you're like, well, of course, duh, like, what else am I going to do? But, but I want you to understand that is not how most people operate. And it, it's what makes you really great and why people feel safe is because you default to that into caring and concerning about people. And they're like, what is this? That's not, that's not how people normally are. So good job.
00:18:24 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
job. Thank you. Thank you.
00:18:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Making me blush a little bit. Well, I am sincere.
00:18:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I promise you.
00:18:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good job. Okay. So did we learn anything? Did she share anything with you that that we can use?
00:18:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Did you have any coaching points? Let's get into the nitty-gritty of everyone. Yeah. So I guess that's where I'm very, let's talk about her. Okay. So generally, she's very happy. She's, she's, I think she was, she, she explained to me that, Initially, she was a little bit, she didn't know how to fit into the sweet lawyer's system because she came from a place where all the jobs were very segregated. so she would only do one type of task. Whereas here, it's kind of like all hands on deck. She likes that she's finding her way through that and that she's getting to a point where she's able to feel helpful, especially at the end of the mountain, things like that. And she likes that she's growing a lot faster than she expected.
00:19:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's living a lot quicker than she expected. I love that.
00:19:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
One of the stress points right now is she wishes she had more time. She asked her, do you feel like you have too many cases that you're too many tasks for the cases that you and John had. And she says, not necessarily, I just wish that there is a way for me to come in earlier in the morning. So like once we get, I can get some of those tasks done before we get phone calls raining in. And she said, well, I might look into some daycare for my kids, my younger kids that don't have school so that I can come in earlier and told her, know, she needs to stay later, that's fine too, know, she doesn't have to work around her schedule within reason. And then we talked, but I do think like it's also, this might be a product of, well, she's still fairly new, she's still learning quite a few new tasks. And I think some things will get quicker as she gets more experience with them. I'm also thinking about talking to John about making sure he doesn't all flow too much to her. Then, you know, we had a conversation a little hard to hard about, you know, like this is not a place where she needs to be on guard all the time, she can make mistakes and we'll work on them to get others, this is a safe place to be, know, she doesn't need to look for perfection. And we set some goals, I told her, you know, she had a hard time setting goals, and so we kind of looked at certain things together. I looked at the cases from her and John and they have, there's too many cases in collecting meds right now, collecting med status. So I asked her what would be a good goal for, to move cases from collecting meds to ready for demand and she set a goal for it to do 20 cases by next month. I think it's a little bit ambitious, I'm honest, but I don't want to, she wants to do 20, I'm not going to like tell her it's too, too many. Right.
00:22:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So elaborate on that for a little bit, did you say collecting meds to ready for demands?
00:22:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:22:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And like meds being like medical like reports and doctors and medical records and billing. Medical records and billing.
00:22:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. Kind of the biggest bottleneck in my case.
00:22:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Now. And her goal was to do what? To get 20.
00:23:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
In what time period 30 days, so we said goals for 30 days. I think 20 I say she gets to between 10 and 15.
00:23:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that would be very impressive. Where is she out right now?
00:23:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I don't have any prior data, but I know on average that's about how much people are able to get because there's so many things outside of your control zone. If the hospital says we'll get to it when we get to it, apart from following up every other day, there's not much you can do to hurry that along.
00:23:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm wondering, so I talked to you in Samantha that one time and we talked a little bit about tracking time and she was definitely not interested in it and everybody operates differently. That's okay. This isn't that. picking lots of other things. But what I will tell you, is I haven't even marked it this exercise, although he pushed off on it for a long time first. But imagine that our time is, so imagine we're a store, and the store operates, and it has a certain amount of stuff that it can sell and make money with, right? There's this fixed, that's your inventory. Well, your business is the tasks that you do. It's rather than items on a shelf. It's the supply is your time, and the things that have to get done. And you have a certain amount of hours to work with. And that's it. So by tracking time, if we were to track everybody's time for a couple of weeks, this has nothing to do with micromanagement. This has to do with finding out what Legos are in the back. That's all it is. It's understanding where things are. are going, how long it takes, and looking at it and zooming out and going. I wonder what would happen if we changed the order of operations. I wonder what would happen if we changed who's doing what or when, but until we don't even know what questions to ask about how we can do it better, until we break down how everybody is spending their time. And if they're not afraid to share it, if they're not afraid to really track it. So for example, you've got Mike, Mike, we know Mike is late, we know Mike takes longer breaks, but we also know that Mike is bomb at getting just distributions, and that he likes doing it, and it doesn't stress him out. And so, you know, imagine everybody's a stick, and on one end there's a poopy side, and on one side there's gold, and you have the gold. but the only way to get the gold is to pick up the poop, like that's how people are. We've got the good, we've got the bad, you get both. You can't separate them, you can't cherry pick what's good about people and refuse to accept what's bad at them. most of the time, our strengths are actually the same things as our weaknesses apply differently. So for example, I'm very bold. I will say what's on my mind, I will step up and get things done, I will just do it. I have this like bull energy and it makes amazing progress. And my brain is powerful and I'm able to think about so many different things and so I can run several different things and several different projects faster and better than the average person is. But that's the strength part of it. When I talk, my brain goes ding, ding, ding, all over the place and people who are not like ADHD cannot follow it and it annoys them and it frustrates them and stresses them out. And when somebody repeats themselves even once, like I heard you the first time, I understood you the first time, you are annoying my brain when you repeat yourself. So now I'm annoyed and that's frustrating them because they're like, well, I need to process things this way. And so to them, it's a perceived weakness. Also, the strength of my energy, some people find incredibly intimidating when it's directed at them, even though it's not directed at them, right? It's just the conversation that we're having. So they hate it when it's pointed at them, but they love it when it's pointed at anybody else on their behalf. But they want to make me wrong for when it's pointed at them. And I'm right and wonderful when it's pointed at anybody else for them. Now, I'm not being any different. I'm being me the same all the time. they're deciding if it's right or wrong or good or bad and they don't get to. Does that make sense? So, you know, Mike, his nonchalance is what makes him so good at distributions because he doesn't care. He does, he does the job, he does it well, but he doesn't care what people think about it. That is exactly the same reason he can roll in late and take long lunches because either you're going to take it or leave it, but I'm going to do what I'm going to do. They are exactly the same qualities. One has a positive effect that we really enjoy. One could be considered non-professional and annoying, but you don't get to pick and choose how it shows up or you do, but if you get rid of him because you don't like how it shows up in his time behavior. here, then you lose the power of how it shows up in this conversation with clients. You pick up under the sticks, you either take the stick or you don't, but you get both sides.
00:29:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:29:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we need to know what's on the stick. And we need to know what it's doing every day. And we need to know, so let's say I don't know, like, what are the things that everyone's good at? is there something if we do some time tracking, and we say, this person and this person both have, you know, similar tasks to do, but this person does this type of task super fast, like we're looking at it and they spend two hours a week doing it.
00:29:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
this person spends 10 hours a week doing it. Not me. I mean, I remember last year when we discussed it, I initially was kind of on board with it, and I presented it to the team. Usually the team is like, you know, whoever Lauren says, we'll do it, know, they're pretty well liked.
00:30:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
likes this task.
00:30:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
But this was like unanimously rejected, all hated it.
00:30:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I think it's because of fear because nobody wants the microscope on them. That is the thing that most people, when I get into teams, they're afraid of it. They're afraid of being inspected closely. But if we can help them understand, it isn't about them and it isn't about looking for flaws. It's about looking for levers, opportunities to find the sunspots and what's different.
00:30:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
it's in take.
00:30:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:30:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I believe my audible, but I might have read it like a few years ago.
00:31:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do. I would like you to read it. So there's one story where there, I don't remember where it was. I feel like it was an Asian, like an impoverished Asian population, where basically everybody was suffering from malnourishment. And but they found this one area, this one village, where the children were thriving. And they're like, and so, okay, so this, this group of people, I'm probably gonna butcher this because it has been like 10 years since I've read the book. But they were tasked with going to helping improve nutrition for an area. They had like six months and almost no money basically. They had like no way to overhaul nutrition because there was not enough money and not enough time. But when they did, down there and they dumped at the Legos basically and they looked at everything and they like what is different. So every single population they were malnourished the children were skinny they were sick they were weak except for this one village and the difference was that the mothers so they while they were working and they started adding the shrimp into the rice and that extra protein and nourishment completely changed the way that they they were they were healthy they were strong they were thriving so that was available to all of the rest of the communities they didn't have to re-educate them they didn't have to get a program going they didn't have to bring new food in they didn't have to change changed the food chain supply at all. It already existed. They just needed to change the way that they behaved, which is utilizing a resource that was already existing and adding it to their meals.
00:33:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, you know, I'm a, you know, my background, I did a psychology in college, but not like, my whole thing was numbers and statistics.
00:33:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
loved it.
00:33:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, yeah. So, I understand the value of the proposition, but I'm wondering if there's an alternative way to get the same results with that.
00:33:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's what I'm going to tell you. I don't. I'm not a fan of interrupting, but I'm going to because this is the leadership job. Sometimes you need to convince people that they need to do the hard thing. Your job is to motivate the troops and say, we need this data. so that you can enjoy your job better. There is something here, like go read that book, go get the study, go see if you can find a parallel study so that you have enough ammunition to explain to them. I have no interest in micromanaging you. I have no interest in picking apart how you're spending your time other than going, is there a way we can build a better mouse trap? How can I help you, like what are the things that you could, do I need to train you better? Maybe I can take something off your plate and shift it to somebody else who enjoys it more and does really well and give you more of what you like. I don't know, but until we break everything down and take inventory, we don't actually know exactly what we're working with. And I want you to care enough about your career. And I want you to have enough trust in me as a leader to say that if we gather this data together, we can look getting go huh what we're doing the best we can okay great job but I've never gone through this exercise with any company over 22 years in any industry where we didn't go whoa I didn't know that what if and then we make a slight alteration and there's improvement but what is requisite first is a willingness to get the information now either these are people who are willing to be a little bit vulnerable and invest in tracking this time or they're not but so let me give you one more motivator that you may not want to use but you can and you should you're spending extra time once a week meeting with me trying to figure out how you can be better for them you take out out of your own pocket your incentive pay to give to the team. You're investing in leadership and improvement. The least that they could do is track their time for two weeks. Because you want to know, look, are you here to collect a paycheck or are you here to be part of a team and be the best part of the team that you could be? If you're here to collect a paycheck, you're probably not going to last a long time. Because you're going to be at this for a couple more decades probably before you retire, right?
00:36:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh yeah, the fire retire.
00:36:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Right. This world is not getting cheaper. So don't you think you have the best odds of being successful at it and being like minimizing stress and actually enjoying your life and enjoying your job if you're surrounded by people who are invested and being the best that they can be like you are?
00:36:56 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I feel like I am right now. I think all four of them are pretty invested in what they're doing, which is why I appreciate them so much.
00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Two weeks of time tracking, like what's their biggest issue?
00:37:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
know this is like, I know you're probably going to say no, but Can I just ask them, okay, you don't need to give me your exact times, but you need to give me a percentage for each task, the percentage of the total time for that day for each task.
00:37:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me tell you why that doesn't work. They will guess if they're not writing down the times.
00:37:45 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, in other words, they would write down the time, but not having to share with me the exacts.
00:37:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Why? Okay, are they not getting paid hourly? Yeah, okay. Is there any reason why it's unreasonable to be held accountable for where your time goes when you're getting paid hourly. But the motive, that's the thing. That's your job as a leader to help them to believe and understand. you could tell them, look, I'm, if I wanted to be a jerk about it, my rights to say, look, you're paid hourly. This, this is, you know, a time report. Um, you know, I say do it, do it. But that's not why we're doing it. This is short term. This isn't going to be something that keeps coming up. It's not about micromanaging because it's not necessary. Micromanaging is counterproductive because you want autonomous people who are going to problem solves themselves. you need to tell them that also. Okay. But what this is, is a leadership effort on your part to figure out what. the pieces are and is there any kind of, okay, so for example, vieri came from a place where the tasks were segmented? Is the way that we're doing it better? How do we know? Let's take a look at what's happening and how it's going and how everybody on the team is performing and just see if we can do something like, do you guys not care enough to be willing just for two weeks, track your time? You can track your time too and you can report it and you can say, hey, I'll report to you, I don't have to, but I'm going to. Lead by example, if you want to, there's all kinds of ways to go about it, but at the end of the day, the more information that we have, the better we can lead and support and encourage and ask them to, like, are you going to be here for a year? Are you going to be here five years, 10 years, 15, 20 years? Do you want to be in an environment that is optimized for you to be able to spend your time doing the things that you enjoy the most or that you're the best at? and being surrounded by people who are being able to. I don't know, like do you wanna, how much joy do you wanna have out of it? Do you wanna come in and just drudge through it? Because what we're doing today, we don't get to keep doing. Like if you're not, we're always moving, we're either moving forward or moving backwards. There is no static, there is no being stagnant. And the market keeps changing. And there will be somebody better coming up. Like if you want to create the environment where you don't have to keep going and looking for another job and new people to work with, then we have to make the most out of what we have here. But in order to do that, we need to analyze it. And we need to not be afraid of analyzing it, which means they need to trust you that you're not there to pick things apart and break it, but you're there to look at it and go, how can we make it better? how can I support you? And either they believe you or they do. don't and either they're willing to do the extra work or they're not. They can grab about it. They don't have to love it. Nobody has to love it. And I would encourage that you don't grab about it because that doesn't support anything and that's negative and it perpetuates negative energy. You can complain once. can say, I don't like it once, once. Other than that, you become a complainer and that's an issue and the culture should be, because we talked about culture last week, we're not here to be a complainer. We're here to make the best out if we can. So that's it. It's a long conversation sometimes. It's a short conversation, but it's your job as a leader to try it now. Now, you don't believe in it, sorry my dogs are going nuts, then that's a whole other issue. So let's start there. Do you think that there's value in understanding how long it takes people to do tasks and how long they spend on it and seeing if there's any kind of patterns that evolve? okay data is my safety blanket right you like you just said like that's what you were looking at was numbers so this should make perfect sense to you so i need you to dig deep and explain to them why you love numbers and to me this is what i tell people all the time numbers tell the truth numbers don't have emotions right so if i go and i look and and very takes um 10 hours a week or 15 hours a week for for just collecting medical records and she's only getting five cases and i don't remember the other person who's equivalent on your team i have to go look at the numbers the spreadsheet hold on mike that would be mike right well they don't work out that way or maybe they did anyway it's not a perfect analog because it's a little bit differently on the other team but right so but anyway comparing what you can and going you know this takes you a lot longer but but for example it's Is there anything that Mike can do to help Viri or I don't know who else would would be doing distributions but can Mike teach anybody any that or is that just his innate qualities and it's not teachable there's probably a tactic that he could share right now and I'm all for cross training um do you have any problem with me saying telling them you know this time keep this time keeping data is just between you me and Tina not a thing not at all and you can tell them my origin how we came to work together um the impact that it had on you last year that mark has been hiring me for over three years now um that he has done this work he's done the time tracking and the time reporting so um you know uh Yeah, I think that that is helpful and to know that, you know, some of the surveys that they've seen in Sweet Law, some of the things that have your team is newer, but that we're constantly looking for supporting and making the best place for the existing people, rather than going, who can we fire? Who can we get rid of? There's never that energy here.
00:44:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I can sell it better like that because it, you know, it doesn't matter how nice Mark and Mary are. There's that upper management where they feel like they have to be a little bit more guarded.
00:44:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you can tell them, Mark's done going to see it, Mark doesn't want to see it. He doesn't even know I'm asking before it. Like that's the autonomy that I have and the autonomy that you have, which in and of itself is part of the culture autonomy and you're not trying to undo it and you wouldn't because micromanagement is a nightmare. It is a just stress cesspool. It's not good for anybody. It feels terrible. This is just data. This is just data. It's data that scares them and you get that because it feels like a microscope. But the intent of the microscope is to go, what can we make better for you, not what's wrong with you?
00:45:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. Yeah, I think I can sell that.
00:45:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The framing is everything and maybe you can tie a reward into it saying like the more accurate the data is after two weeks, like this is what I'm willing to put into it. Maybe you give them, I don't know if it's a financial incentive or maybe just, I don't know. I don't know how to do that. I don't know what motivates your people. But if you could then by sending it incentivize them, or just even show thanks, you know, whatever you have to do, but I can tell you that data is super helpful. There's always an aha moment where we can go, oh, this might be how we can support them better. For example, so one of the surveys that we did was Sweet Law. Black Swan, Black Swan, you know who Black Swan is, right? Yeah. Okay. That came as a result of a survey. That came as a result of me saying, how can we help your people more? Where are they struggling? And one of the answers was converting leads to cases. So it wasn't just intake, but it was also, you know, the attorney team. And it was primarily intake being better at sales, but it also can happen from, you know, getting fired up of cases. And there's this whole persuasion tactic. So But it was a long time going through, just trying to get people to read the book from Black Swan first, and then trying to get the appointment and get the training, like you don't know how many times, every single week, I'm like, where are you at with Black Swan? Well, blah blah blah. Like it just took so long, but as a result of it, Samantha, for example, just reading the book automatically improved, she took some concept from it. She had an aha moment, and from that point forward, applied it and improved her numbers rapidly. I wish I could remember what it was, but I don't know what the tactic was because I didn't read the book anyway. But that's my point, is that we didn't know until we did the survey and asked questions, and somebody was willing to be honest and say, I could be better at sales, and so we got that. And you can share that. There was another, the intake also, at least one person, but I think that there were a couple of people that said, I don't know how to talk to people whose child died or whose spouse died in an accident. Like, this is really difficult. And so we got the grief counselor to come in and talk to them. Did you know that?
00:48:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, but I wish I would have been there because that's like one of the things that I struggle with too was when I because in Arizona, the attorney has to talk to the to the client before they sign. And usually, like, I get a little nervous every time I have to talk to a debt, wrongful death case.
00:48:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, we could, I could get Mark to bring them back in. And also, there are people who didn't get that. So because they're new since then.
00:48:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You know, I do OK. Like, I don't like avoid it if I'm the only one available.
00:48:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But do you want to do OK? do you want to get some extra skills that can help you be even better at it?
00:49:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'm always for extra skills.
00:49:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, and that's the thing I want you to take from this is that these things are happening in Sweet Law, but it starts with asking questions, it starts with honest vulnerable answers, then it goes with taking action and trying to improve that situation, but none of it did anybody get, you know, laser pointed, hey, you're coming out of here. It has all been beneficial to the members of Sweet Law.
00:49:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, with the month I'm having right now, I don't know. Oh, we're having a pretty crappy month right now, so.
00:49:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, we've got a little bit more time. What is there anything that you feel like you have control over that you can improve that?
00:49:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
There's sticks in the fire, and I know they're going to come, but right now, I mean, it's bad. It's like my worst month so far.
00:50:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So we've been digging into your team. I would like to spend some time working with you and working with your processes. I'm sure that we can do something to improve it. But you are, your team is you. Like these are your resources. So I need you to be successful at persuading them. We need this information. I need to know what your resources are and you need to know what your resources are. Because being able to lean on mic for distributions had to have been really eating to you.
00:50:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, yeah, extremely.
00:50:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So is there other relief that can come for you and for others that we don't know about because we haven't fully inspected. So here's the thing is if Lorenz's pod goes down, guess what happens Like, if you don't hit your numbers and you don't have a job, guess what happens to everybody else?
00:51:05 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
They don't have job.
00:51:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, so help me help you, right? Jerry Maguire, then. Tell me the money. Tell me the money. So, look, and we're at the beginning of this, and I need you to just take a deep breath and be like, I am on the path of growth, and I'm willing to do the work. Now, if you see that you could hustle your way to something different, if you could see where you can make some improvements, what, so other than what we've already talked about, I want you to do that. want you to get your team on board with time tracking for two weeks, incentivize them, however you can, but you can be vulnerable to and say, like, this is the worst month I've ever had since I've been here. If I'm out, you're out. And this is not your fault. So, I'm trying to figure out how do I make everybody be as great as possible. possible so that we not only just have jobs but we have jobs we'd like that we want to stay with working with people we like um that's your job that's what you need to do you need to lead them you need to make them trust you because you are trustworthy anyway and you are safe and do that and then I need you to start digging into your processes I need you to track your time Lorenz that would be very helpful to me um I may need to ask Mark about that and say hey can you help me look at this you'll be safe with him just just your time and but I'm asking you at a time if you're okay with that um if you track your time for two weeks and say hey what do you notice about this could you make it better he likes you he knows that you are reliable he you you are wanted you are wanted so he wants you to be good you want to be good the business needs to be good. You'll get paid more if you do better. I need you to trust that you're safe with him as very as with you because you are.
00:53:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, he's pretty inscrutable when that comes to me.
00:53:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I get a different perspective and I need you to be able to trust me. I know both sides. I've seen glimpses of it and but I know the game. I know the locker room talk and I know the person and you're as safe with him as very as with you. So but I want you to buckle down. want you to roll up your sleeves. I want you to be vulnerable and I want you to get the work. So start tracking your time very closely. Let me analyze it first. If I can find an not on my own. We can just keep it between us. So that will mean that I need you to be super informative about all these things. So when you track your time, I want you to explain it to me too, because I don't know all the lingo. I don't know all the operations. I don't know a lot, I don't know all of it. So I want you to be really thorough and explain this is this, this is this, this is why this is important. This is what's hard about this. This is what this means to the value of the case. Like, I want you to analyze it as much as you can before you even give it to me.
00:54:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So you don't want just the Y as well?
00:54:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The Y, the how, the way you prioritize it, what logic you use to prioritize it. I want to understand everything I possibly can understand about it. Because the way my brain works, I should be able to help. And if I can't and we need to get It's what I need insight from market that we can, but the more information you give me, the less likely I'm going to ask or need to ask anything because Lorenz, this is what I do most is optimized. So that data is really important to me. So if you can do a good job of tracking it accurately, timestamps as often as possible, and then really explain it, I can just about guarantee you I can find something to improve you. But now I want to go back and just give you one more reminder that we had one conversation you thought differently about how to make leaders around you and you up to numbers immediately that very next month. So we are going through and we're looking for leverage and we're having way more than one conversation and I don't ever fail because when people will do the work and we get the data, there's always a very simple path to improvement even if it's small and then what happens is those small improvements start to compound. So there's really not anything to be afraid of because statistically I don't feel and the people I work with don't fail if they show up and they get the data and they do the work. It hasn't happened yet. Not saying it can't. I'm just saying that there's always a place to improve a little bit and that little bit of improvement having the compounding effect and now you're multiplying it times everybody else having a little bit of improvement and now your whole team is improving month after month, after year, like that's powerful. Those numbers start to become very obviously much better but what happens in addition to it and this is my favorite part is there's less stress while it's happening because now people understand the mechanics where they weren't even considering the mechanics before. They're like I still have to work and I do what I do. Instead of a stroke to work, I do what I do, but why do I do what I do and why do I do it this way and when they analyze it and then they optimize it, that's a whole new ball game. And so think about when you're driving and you're learning how to drive. There's a lot. And the first time that you get behind the wheel so imagine being a kid being like that's so easy. All you have to do is like press the gas and go room room and turn the wheel my kids every single time until they drive and then they drive it like oh my gosh it's so scary. Yeah, because you're having to make multiple calculations instantaneously on the fly they're so much going through your brain and you're having to evaluate every single thing. Is it my turn to go do I put a signal on do I break it my breaking too much. That guy's going is it my turn and like wait, wait, there's all these different things. Okay, and you're having to process them. And so in the beginning. you're having to make these calculations and they're new, so you're just asking yourself, what are the numbers that even going into the calculations? But eventually, you drive so much that they become reflexive. You automatically know, like, imagine what it was like when you were learning your times tables. At first, you have to sit there and like, it all down and figure it out and find some way to do it. And then you memorize it. And then you know, 4 times 4 is 16. 6 times 6 is 36. Like, you just know what they are. So you don't have to spend time on it, which means it's less stressful because it's reflexive now. Driving is no longer stressful because it's reflexive now. Math is not basic, right? There's a lot of things that become less stressful because they're reflexive because what you did was stop having to make the calculations. So But if you can create the system that removes the need to make the calculations and the calculations are needed because I'm stressed out and how do I figure out how to get through these things when the phone starts ringing all day? Well, I need to come in two hours early, but now I have to go take my two kids who are not even in school yet and get daycare. So I'm going to disrupt their time and it's going to be early and I'm going to spend extra money just so I can do the job that should be able to be contained in the work hours.
00:59:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Right.
00:59:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. That's stressful. What if we could get enough information and the only thing that came out of it is Viri is meeting her goals and now she doesn't have to go disrupt the lives of her young children by getting a daycare provider and now somebody, does she trust them? Are they safe? Are they happy? Do they feel loved? Is she stressed out the rest of the time? I'm now because she's leaving her little kids and they're only going to be little for a few more years before they start school. Like, that's a big deal in a person's life. But with a little bit more information, we might be able to figure out how to optimize what we're doing so that her children aren't so that her performance is still good throughout the day because she's not depressed that she had to lead them two hours earlier just to get the job done. Because we're not segmented and segregated here like in other businesses and maybe I should just go back to another firm where at least I only have one type of task and I didn't have to leave my kids. Like, people don't think about all these things in their teammates. Sometimes the bosses aren't thinking about them, but your people are thinking about them and sometimes they just make a decision and then they up and lead. So you need to think about it all proactively. And in order to be able to think about it well, you need eat data and information. So you can use that as an example. If you talk to Viri first and say, can I use this as an example? And maybe you don't use her specifically, maybe find a way around it and draw a similar kind of story that doesn't draw too much attention to her. But at the end of the day, greatness is always hard work. Average is, it's not fun, it's stressful. The average job is people don't want to go. They go because they have to. Because they have to pay bills. That's the average workplace. Showing out to a place that you like to work, even if it's remote and existing with an organization that you like and that you feel safe with, that's not average, that's above average. That's great. But to keep, to get even better, like it takes more or effort. So you have to decide what you want and then you have to decide who you want with you and then you have to decide if you can motivate them to be great with you because it would be so much more enjoyable than just being worried about your job every day or every week or every month.
01:02:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. I'll start trying my time tomorrow then.
01:02:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right.
01:02:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Hopefully I can be, you know, can have like first-hand experience and then I'll be able to sell them all that even stronger.
01:02:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that and we can wait so that you have some example and then you know if you want to wait a couple weeks before you ask them, track your time.
01:02:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
and I could only make sense for me to jump into the frame, know, before them.
01:02:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. I love that. I love leading by example. And then if we find something, a nugget that we can work on to improve for you, you can say, look, this was my experience. I did it, and I know exactly what I can do to make some improvements, and I feel better about it. I feel more peaceful about it. I feel clearer about it. that's everything. You know, you testify yourself, I know that this is going to be good for us, and I'm only looking for the good.
01:03:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
01:03:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. You can do this. And the goal, the goal is that it's to, it's to feel great, it's to enjoy the people that you're working with, the work that you're doing. We're not going to enjoy all of it. There's going to be stuff that sucks. That's just life. But you can create packets of just, wow, that's great. These people are great. This is awesome. And it's okay that I have to do this. for the next 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 years, whatever it is.
01:04:04 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, yeah, I want them to know what it's like to feel like you're working every day for someone else's dream. I want to feel like they're working towards their own dreams to they're invested in them.
01:04:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, the growth of business as much as they are on their own. Yes. And that's a good thing to also what we didn't get to what I would love for you to do is send me what everybody's goals where you said you wanted goals for each of the people about time. my job was waiting for me to take her shopping so she can get ready for girls camp. I'm fine. I'm excited about that. But please send me that just so I have it. And any other notes that you might have just clip notes on how those meetings went. And then so next week, I'm meeting just with Patrick. And then the week after that, we'll have our group meeting and then the week after that is our one on one. So we'll figure it out. out. But if you send that to me an email, then maybe we can just kind of work this in the background. But the very least, that gives you those two weeks to be tracking your time. And I want you to analyze it. want you to look at it and go, huh, maybe, you know, just see if you noticed any kind of patterns.
01:05:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Sure. Yeah.
01:05:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Thanks, Tina. You're awesome. Thank you for your time, Lawrence. I hope you have a great week.

Hey, hey, long time no see I know it feels like I don't like it.
00:00:08 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's been a month or so. Yeah, I didn't know if we were meeting today or that was like a legit invite. I guess you get it set up now for monthly calls.
00:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, well, yeah, I mean, we could do we could do every other week. Um, like I don't and just figure out what works for you. You've been very busy and very quiet with your head down working. So yeah, I don't know what to do. I don't know what you need, what you want right now.
00:00:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I mean, it's just, uh, you're in a good flow. It seems like. Yeah, I mean, I'm just my day. I mean, it's summer. So yeah, so it's really about like maximizing the mornings and, um, I mean, I, I work. in the afternoon too, but like, it's just mornings just my jam. So like, it's actually, it's funny. was actually getting ready to write an update.
00:01:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, good. I did, I thought the morning six, twenty six, twenty four. I was like, oh, I'm like, okay. And I left some comments too, but mostly just about what I want to talk about from the notes that you left last week. But so go ahead.
00:01:30 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, I mean, just, I guess just quickly, like, things are going well with Tim, Tim's the Jim Profit, Jim Solutions guy. I'm working on a new sales letter, well, promotion for probably middle of July, so I'm looking out for them.
00:01:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And and your results paid for many months of working with you.
00:01:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So that's pretty. Yeah, in our officially our. 90 days will end on July 17th, so probably after the 4th, I'll send him an email and just acknowledge like, hey, we're coming up at the end of our 90 days. Do you want to continue working together and review the results of the promo and then this new promo that I'm writing for them?
00:02:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would recommend saying, hey, you know, that that last promo basically paid for me for the next nine months, so what do you say? Keep working together and here's what we do and that there's no way, you know, that you're not going to keep making more money for what I'm doing, so I'm thinking it's a no brainer and and I'm telling you because I just did that with one of my attorneys. So last year, I talked to, so I have an attorney that has another office and he's got like, sits attorney.
00:03:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
journeys that work for him.
00:03:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Last year, I talked to two of them. One of them was his top performer and one of them was his bottom performer. And the top performer was like, I don't need you, I'm good. Which was okay, because she's the top performer. the other one was like, yeah, I've got all these goals, I could do this, I could do that. And I gave them a couple of books. I, you know, after listening to him, I'm why don't you just work on this one thing? And he did, and he doubled his attorney fees. So he went from a million dollars to two million dollars attorney fees. And so this last week, I was talking to him, because he was talking about wanting to do some work. I'm like, well, I mean, the results paid for itself last year. You could be in pay me every month and you'd still be in profit from hiring. So that's a brainer.
00:03:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You guys. Oh, yeah, you're right.
00:03:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, well, just don't think about what the return is. And so just pointing it out in simple math, like right in front, like, you know, when we do the numbers exercise, the numbers just make it a no-brainer. like, oh, duh, I mean, already ROI form the initial investment plus eight more months, you know. So it's just, if you want the job, that's the no-brainer offer.
00:04:27 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right, right. Yeah, that's a good point. I'll, yeah, I'm thinking after the fourth is when I'll put any mail together, but that's, you know, and I'll definitely point out, like, you know, we brought it, we did 45k to own our first promotion. And what are the profit sharing, like, profit partner kind of arrangement? Yeah, I mean, I think that that can be in the future. I mean, honestly, like, right now, I mean, I kind of, I kind of like getting the 5K every month and, and that, that feels like it's serving more what I need right at the moment.
00:05:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, just guaranteed it's there.
00:05:17 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, yeah, but it's also giving me just like, I mean, the competences, I'll just say it. I feel like there's a better word, it's giving me Or it's holding my eyes to like, you know, I can, like, I can go and if this falls through with Tim, like, I'll, I'll go to somebody else and I can handle, you know, writing their copy of their emails. I think one of the things I've learned working with Tim is like, because. He's got a very specific strategy that he's wanted to do, that he is doing in a space with group, and we're following this client and community guys for Stapleton, and he's got a partner for his name, but you know, it's like I'm writing, I guess this is the first time that I'm really executing on what the actual work to be like a lightweight influencer of sorts, and I say lightweight because it's only like one post a day where I think of like a TikTok influencer or putting out a bunch of short form content, so it's a different type, but it's a different type of content, and it's, I was thinking about this, like I think It really is the first time that I've done this kind of thinking and work of like creating social media content, tying it to a promotion that I know is coming to three weeks from now and thinking about like seeding these little agreements in my posts. And that and that's that part is cool. But I where I'm going with that is like I kind of that like that's fun to think about for somebody else and do it for them. It is not the thing that I would want to do for me as a guest. So yeah, there are two things I want to talk to you about right there.
00:07:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So first of all, you're doing one of my favorite strategies, one of my favorite levers, which is getting paid to learn and to sharpen yourself off. So this is a really, really viable skill, even if you don't want to do it. or so doing it for other people, it's important to know the logistics of how it works and why it works. I'm the same way I don't want to do any of the stuff for myself. What I can do for everybody else, I almost always cannot do for myself. I can do a little bit of it. But I think about doing it for myself and like new, not going to happen. Just I can, I won't. Part of that by the way is in alignment with 80 and negative dysfunction. And that can be a really normal thing for most entrepreneurs.
00:08:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It tends to be for like all of my clients.
00:08:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can always treat everybody else differently. So there's that. But if you have enough clients of your own, we're not doing a lot of work, we can hire somebody that can do this for you. That will extract from you what they need to do. That's very good at doing this. But because you already have the skill and knowledge, when they're driving, you can go actually, why don't we tweet this and that? So it goes to the same kind of thing that you like to do when it comes to copy, which is copy cheating, not the junior copywriting, right, you don't want to start from scratch. So if you have enough funds where you can hire somebody for maybe $1,000 a month. And obviously, you'd need to be where you're really comfortable and you've got that. So the goal would be maybe another Tim or two, if it doesn't take a lot. Because that's an extra $10,000, which you could even use for a junior copywriter, you know, a little bit of it. So, so that you're not adding too much work. But that could be really leveraged. And so now you can hire somebody to work in your own business, who's very skilled, but you don't need a lot of time to build out a social media campaign. So it's not like they got to work 40, 20 hours, you know, maybe 10 hours.
00:09:48 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
But it isn't about the hours, it's about the results.
00:09:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if they're really good at what they do, you know, if you're just paying like, it's a flat rate, here's the job. Do you agree to accomplishing this job? for this amount of money and you know so it's you know per the project or whatever you can do that and there's a lot of people with that skill now you know now versus three years ago four years ago 10 years ago like it's so much different yeah um so but you being sharp on this and the extra money coming in um the tea money I feel like is for sure going to come in don't know what the titans numbers look like but you guys have been pretty steady you've learned about what the bootcamp does you're doing the podcast app you didn't leave any notes about that so I'd love to know about that but it feels like you're leveraging and you're building this um financial kind of moat and hedge that could support you having a small surgical strike team for yourself yeah um I have thought about just needing just getting one other person like a copywriter
00:11:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
down the road if because I'm thinking like I could do that I could get another time like I could manage that and I would bring on somebody to help with that and but I don't feel ready to take that step and go out and pursue that just yet but it's on my mind and I've got a few people in mind that I would reach out to that I feel like I could get a it wouldn't be hard to get a yes from them and they would well I guess I don't know if they would pay five grand but I was like that that's gonna be my my minimum that's gonna be my to do what I do and cuz like it Like I put my whole My brain into this and like I consume all their go through all their courses and you know the to just learn the product and I just feel like the level of service that I Bringing in the the copy that I fruit not just a copy of just like thinking through like I put the whole promotion or the bonuses and like all this Like the whole package like it's Yeah, I just realized like that that's what I am gonna do. That's what I'm gonna want to do because I feel like that's gonna Give us the best chance of succeeding and so for that You know, I'm grand Which I think is an insane deal and bargain Which is why I was talking about when I was talking about the profit sharing and I was talking about a flat rate of five grand plus
00:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you know a percentage of like a very tiny percentage like maybe even one percent of the net profits from the promo.
00:13:09 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Like not a business just from the promo like a performance bonus. Yeah, that could be a possibility. And they're great guys. It's 10 and I don't know if they're super great and laid back. And they're very hands off. know, this is awesome. They don't get in my way.
00:13:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean you've earned that too with who you are. You have a reputation, you're in an environment where you are positioned as an authority and so but there are people you know that they do know how to do that research and spend that time studying everything I think a lot of the female copywriters are probably more in line to do that and not charge a whole lot but there's also a lot of copywriters who just aren't they're not marketers for themselves so they can sell everybody else's stuff but themselves so they don't charge the highest rates they don't ask super high fees and but they just want consistent work and they want to work with good people that don't abuse them these copywriters who get abused a lot like they're responsible for all the sales even if there's crappy product bad people who don't know how to manage their business give good information, um, they're lying about what they're trying to sell, like all kinds of things, right? But it's a copywriter's job to make everything work. That and the media buyers, like that's it, some of the most ridiculous kind of expectations that are put on those type of people. But for you, like, if you had, let's say, two more clients and then you wouldn't want to do them back to back go in for yourself and really know their stuff inside out. Um, you know, like, I don't like to stack on new clients all at once because I, I, I dream about everything. Like, that's how much it's in my head because I don't know things yet. And my brain can't stop thinking about it because I have all these questions until I have a really good view of things or a good enough view. literally can't rest mentally. because I'm still trying to work it out and process it. And so, you're going and you're learning all these things. And I know your brain is always going. You're always thinking about stuff. So you had to kind of keep that in mind. But if you set the intention of trying to find somebody that you can work with that chart is a lot less than you do, that can do some different stuff, like maybe you give them an assignment of going through all these sales pages, all these email sequences and coming back and giving me a report. What this is, give me a few samples. instead of digging into all the different sources, you can just look at this. Maybe it's a document with a snapshot of here's a here's a literal picture of some of the copy from the website, some of the copy from the thank you page, some of the copy from the email sub all in one thing. So that's saving you time from click, click, click, click, click, right? But also what you know is that they've actually been into it, they've actually looked at it, and they've given you a report back and said, okay, here's what I see, right, this is a weak spot that they have, right, they're really not highlighting their USP, they really don't have a good hook, but here's a hook I did find, here's, you know what I mean, there's a process, and if you're looking at doing this for another 10, 20 years, 30, whatever, like I would imagine that long, I would like to see you make enough money where you can just start investing at your money's working for you. But you're going to be doing this for a long time anyway, so you really should be sending an intention of, I've got a solid junior copywriter or two that I'm working with who are, you know, really happy to be working with me because I'm a good guy and I'm not going to get them bad clients, I'm going to give them, you know, as consistent work as possible, but they're still contractors, which means you're not their financial protector. looks like maybe is it a male or female is it there's a lot of childless women in the copy world I don't know you know but there are and they also do not charge the same kind of rates as their male counterparts they're very loyal they're incredibly smart and and they love working for really great people you're the type of person that would that they would love working with and working for so that's something that you can kind of just tuck in your cap and know um kind of set a magnet out you know looking for that because you've come across them throughout the talking you've mentioned this person that person whatever and I'm like that's very interesting to me because I've been noticing it more and more so anyway those are just some things to think about because you're right on that press this. It's going to be one day you're like, okay, it's time to pull the trigger. And that's very soon. Especially with the results you got with that promo.
00:20:09 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I know, I know. well, I just turned out, yeah, yesterday, today's Wednesday, Monday, that there were three more new call appointments that came in last week for this week. they're using for the offer that I wrote. And they're using on their sales calls, the offer, the whole promo that I put together. Because before it was just here's an eight week course. We do weekly calls. And I turned it into this. Well, not an intern. Communicated what it actually was is not like I created something. It's just like they got so much more than just like an eight-week Course and yeah, but they would just we're doing a disservice and Leaving money on the table talking about it. Yeah, and now I'm working on this new promo, which is really cool It's all about how to turn switch your gym to is what's called a semi semi-private model and So it's like a hybrid of one-on-one and small group, but it's a four to six People in a class, but each one's got it their own individual customized workout and Like that's the model that Tim runs in his gym and they just you charge like a hundred bucks a week um for this kind of special specialized attention and community and You know at that at that rate like just to get to half a million in a year, you need less than 100 members doing a semi-private model and so it's, mean, can probably tell it's interesting to me because I'm into fitness, I don't really want to start a gym or anything, but it's interesting getting to know this market. And like just understand their financial issues and then now helping them make this switch to doing a semi-private model and seeing like how lucrative that can be for somebody who really is passionate about you coaching somebody and their fitness journey.
00:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, go ahead, keep on.
00:23:02 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
But like I was working on this promo today, I just went through all the training material, and that's the initial hook or headline that I'm working around. I'm going to write tomorrow morning around this idea, but it's something around how to build a $500,000 a year business with less than a hundred members, a $500,000 a year gym business with less than a hundred members. Something in that ballpark is where I'm thinking that that will be the hook, and then the sales letter describes how that happens.
00:23:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you happen to know the attrition rate?
00:23:48 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Not off the top of my head, but oh, for semi-private, it's not as high as tradition. like control access.
00:24:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow, so that's a hook right there. Yeah, that's a that's a massive hook right there because I would think it would be higher because of the amount of money. No, that means if I'm a business owner and I read that, I'm like, yeah, but like, how many people do I actually have to, how many times do I have to fill in that hundred, you know, like, and not everybody because I don't think everybody thinks about attrition, but I do. So, but anyway, but again, we'll have the numbers tell the story for you. Right, because it's a really powerful thing to say you only have to get 100 yeses, right, 100 people to say yes to this offer. don't need to get, you know, 500 or 1000 people like it's 100. And if the attrition rate, let's say it's 40%, you know, 140 people to say yes, that still sounds very doable. You break that up across, you know, the months or whatever, like just if you show them how easy it is, if you're providing this offer, this service, and also if you could show them, you know, where does it work? Does it only work in metro areas? Does it work in rural areas? Does it work in certain areas that have a medium income of X or whatever? Like if you were to do some data like that and do some case studies, put that on the website, which of course that takes time to build and to to see because it's a newer type of offer. But that's something that you can be working on with Tim and say, look, these are all the things that like basically build yourself a job for the next year. Like this is what we're building, this is what we're working on. We have to be getting these case studies. We're going to continue to get this data, but the data is going to continue to change as more people are doing it. going to get more information. But either way, like it's already paying for itself over and over again. And so get on board.
00:26:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Let's do this stuff.
00:26:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And yeah, but you could also be in terms of like you always want to be giving back to people. You be changing the fitness industry where people actually might be showing up more consistently because they're actually getting one on one health customized health. It's semi-private. So, you know, they're not paying as much as they would. So it's a little like, but that's not the word restrictive. And, you know, it could be making something really great, more available to more people than it was, but also allowing the trainers and the gym members because they're working with more people consistently because you're helping them stay full, be able to sharpen their saws and get better at what they do. So, like, just a little criss over here with a copywriting $5,000 a month. But I was just like taking over making a huge difference in the world. to me, that's the kind of stuff I love about what I do in my business. And maybe nobody else is acknowledging the impact that you're making. But if you look at it, that's a huge impact.
00:27:16 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Totally. And I mean, really, the comparison, guess, the Apple, it'd be more Apple's to comparison my private to one-on-one personal training.
00:27:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah.
00:27:30 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know, as I was thinking about it. Definitely. But there are, like I knew once that like orange theory, their average, do you know orange theory? No. that would be considered a large group model so that you go from station to station. Okay. So everybody's doing the same workout. You can have up to 30 people. know.
00:27:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like circuitry.
00:28:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I mean, but that's right now. Yeah, exactly. Okay. Um, so that'd be a large group model. And you can, you know, that you can make more than just doing like a general admission gym doing by having these larger groups. But like orange theory, they're, uh, uh, what's the word I'm looking for? The people leave on average after three or four months, their memberships last so long. usually it's not that, not that long. Um, but what ends up happening with, uh, semi-private is there's a, there's there's a onboarding, like there's a way that Tim sells it because I've gone through his training and, um, he, he kicks off the semi-private by bringing, he has a, an event because of the state of the union. as Jim, and he just brings in members and holds this two-hour event, and he just lets know where the fitness industry is going, then he introduces, he's got this whole script of how you introduce semi-private and compare it to one-on-one, but it's not as expensive as one-on-one, and then he's got two different ways he does contracts with people when they come in, so it's like, he's got a really solid team. I forget where I was going with that, but I do want to talk a little bit about Titans, switching gears, like Brian, he's been laying a little low. We've got the Over-Deliver Bootcamp coming up next month, and I'm I had a call with him. Oh, it his past Monday we met and he's having a procedure done on his on his heart. He shared with me a small, like outpatient, he said, but he's been having not, he said, I'm not going into a fib, which he was doing that like all the time before his last surgery, but he would he call it. Not palpitations or rhythmia, maybe.
00:30:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what it was, I think.
00:30:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
you know, he's, he's, and he was apologetic. He's like, I know, I've been, he owes me things and I figured something was going on because he's, he's usually faster to respond. you've watched him withdraw and then seen why he withdraws. Mm hmm. Um, and I brought up, I said, we haven't talked about this event in a while, and last time we spoke like we were doing it in January, and he was like, ah, don't know. He started doing this thing that he does. And, um, he, you know, he's using, this is going to sound more, I don't know, know, to come across this way, but he's using his health as an excuse to not really think about the, the event and, and plan that. So, whether that's, you can say it's legit, like, all right, if you need to do that, then that's totally fine. And I'll just, I'll just accept that, like, that's It's what he needs to do, because I'm not going to tell him, you know, uh, the alternative, I guess, but, but it just got me thinking because then he was like, you know, I don't know, like January of 2026, we could do this event, but I was just like, you know, it since Monday, I just, I've always, um, I've always just felt like I'm on this little bit of a roller coaster. With Brian in terms of like how he wants to show up, and, you know, get, and he even told me, he's like, you know, I'm like two or three times your age, and, and I'm like, you know, there's going to be probably in the near future where he just wants to not do this anymore.
00:32:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so that's where I'm pretty new. Like he's been sun setting for a while.
00:32:52 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:32:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Sorry, I didn't want to cut you off like I just, but that's, that is the thing. that we've been watching and there is, you know, there are kind of, at the very least right now, two things to look at. You have great respect and reverence for Brian and appreciation for him and overall this is his business. However, you have been deeply invested in it, you have nurtured it, you have been the primary reason for not only its growth, but its maintenance for probably the last four years or so. Whenever he had a stroke, I feel like it was around 2020, that wasn't it? It was around there, yeah. And you have not only been invigorating to his business, but you have been invigorating to his life. And it's not even about feeling entitled to any particular thing. even though you've earned stuff, it's that the writing is on the wall that Brian's pace is probably permanently changed. ability, like his fire is flickering. It's not extinguished. It bursts up a little bit. It goes down a little bit based on health, life circumstances, but it has definitely altered significantly, and I would be shocked if it's not permanently. I know he's a peptide, I do believe that there are miraculous things that can happen. I don't think Brian has the willpower and the drive inside of him to drive to it. He doesn't seem like a hardcore driven person anymore. Like I think that part has flickered out and been replaced by family and life, which is okay. But... I think that that was a priority shift that changed permanently. And if he truly does have everything that he needs set aside financially, that he doesn't have to make more money, then that has to come into it too. And you are just hitting your stride of like, I am a business man. I got skills, I can bring money, I can grow, and all of these other people, there's a market that is begging to be served, quality content, quality service. I'm here to do it, you know, and now you're being throttled. You've been throttled. You've been throttled since I met you with Brian not showing up. And this is with all due respect. It isn't about bad-mouthing him for it.
00:35:53 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I mean, we've had this conversation many times. We don't really need to say it, but I do.
00:35:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's just a real- be difficult situation to be in. So back to, you know, what can you do? I think, at some point, like, I think you really have to keep leaning into building the thing that you build, and pacing stuff out, and letting go of like, don't even try to plan events with Brian, you know, I just, because it will, you deserve to not be frustrated, but also the power of that frustration can be so detrimental to your happiness, to your peace, to your productivity, and all of your happiness and peace impacts how you show up as a dad. And even if it's just a slight diminishing, it's going to be perpetual because this is the pattern that Brian has over and over again, commit to something, doesn't do it for really valid reasons in terms of like, you know, but it, but that, that is what it is. So I would be looking for, how do we nurture Titans, Accelerator, and as with as little dependence upon Brian as possible, what does that model look like, where it's at the very least maintaining its revenue for you and for him, very at the very least maintaining its value and reputation, which I think that you can do like you could probably do all the over delivered book camps by yourself and people still feel good because you're showing up in the Titans world so much and so many of them are so new that and you've been there since day one, that's potentially it. You know, something to think about along that path but really just how do you build it independent of Brian where he can be like, surprise, I'm here. Yeah, everybody. I did not be, but nothing that requires he has to show up. think there's still a lot of financial potential for you, where that's not stressful. Because the other option is, like, can I at leaving, giving an ultimatum of like, this is how it's going to be, or maybe just give me a higher percentage because this is a lot to deal with, and also give me more power over what happened without having to get your approval, because you're bottlenecking and I'm trying to build and grow. And I understand why you're doing it. You've got real needs, but so do I. Like, I'm in business and I might give half at least of my time to this. anyway, that's a lot to think about. It's a lot to process. But maybe that's just something that you can work through because you tend to really Defer to just supporting Brian and just being like it is what it is and not taking care of yourself the way that you ought to and advocating for yourself. And I think that you should advocate for yourself I think that you have more than earned it. And it isn't just advocating for yourself, but the business and the customers that you serve, they need stability and reliability also.
00:39:30 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Well, you know, we're doing rolling out two things inside of TXL that I think is going to help with retention. One is you know about the public podcast, the timeless marketing and that's more about bringing people in, but we were also putting all the calls from TXL into a private podcast. Podcast. that only members can access, and so that's going to make it easier for everybody to be able to access the call recordings right from their phone, like inside the Apple podcast app or Pocketcast or whatever podcast app they use. And the other one is we're starting accountability pods within the group that's led by the members. And so they'll have a set schedule that they meet on. You know, they'll be independent of our two to three calls a month. And so the hope there is that that's going to help foster the community and get people connected. You'll hold people accountable to reaching the goals that they have. Those two things are giving or rolling out the podcast I'll announce, probably before July 4th, pods, I put the initial plan together and sent to Brian and this one of the things he owes me, all in feedback on, but I've been thinking, like don't feel anger or fear, I feel little after that call with Brian, but I've just kind of been thinking like, all right, I want to keep TX all going and I want to keep growing, break through advertising. And in the long term, I still would like to, you know, be a part of break through advertising for forever. you know, whenever the point comes of like Brian passes away, you know, we'll have, whenever Jean's wife Barbara passes away is when we'll because her son will get it. Yeah. Yeah. At that point.
00:42:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How old is she?
00:42:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh, she's like 90 something. Wow. Yeah. She's, she's up there, but, um, yeah, and not rocking the boat, you know, when, when there's that kind of investment and, and I, it's not a just selfish, like I go, wait for him to die and I get this kind of thing.
00:42:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not that it's, I mean, all these relationships are nuanced, um, but that goes back to how do you nurture titans, independent. of Brian where he can just you know show up and less it when he wants to and can but that the stability of it is anchored on the things that you do steadily so that you know it's there you're taking care of he's taking care of and the market is taking care of like I think that you've gotten the ability to do that and I think that just not trying to have big events but I realize that there was a big part of it there's a lot of potential for it there's a lot of connection but but based off of every single year there's been something that has for the last four years at least that has really just been overwhelming for Brian and he's had to pull back for a while so and an event takes months and he he always, for the last few years, has seemed to be, and even before, you know, four years ago, in the beginning, you were like, he wants to get out of the masterminds, like the in-person stuff. So, he's been pulling steadily back out of showing up in person and overcommitting to things for years. That's just not, I can't see that changing. So, to even consider doing something like that and hoping it's going to be able to come to fruition, first of all, could be really detrimental to the brand because people get excited and they want to have it. And then, you know, can only get disappointed so many times before you like tease. Almost, you know, they're hardcore people. and it didn't hurt his brand. Well, you can't say that. But die-hard fans will stay die-hard fans.
00:44:59 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know what I mean? Yep.
00:45:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But that's not all you have in the market. And that's not the only people seeing the stuff that happens. It's also the new people coming in. And so just kind of taking that into account. I think that you can create the thing that just maintained a steady pace where you get to grow and serve the market and just kind of wait for the inevitable, even if it takes years, whether it's Jane's wife or Brian. But I think that compartmentalizing and just kind of putting titans into, putting TXL into like a portion of your day, portion of your week and really focusing on everything else that you're building would be really wise for you.
00:45:52 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Well, and the good thing about that is, you know, like, we do Do you have a small team that really runs?
00:46:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:46:06 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know, and like the social media posts, the podcasting, the, you know, Jamie's handling all the tech stuff. Carlin and Margie are handling the renewals, TXL renewals. You got Jeremy and they're working with you too, right?
00:46:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's that? You got Jeremy Weiss and that makes two.
00:46:30 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, for the podcast. Yeah. And, you know, that's that's humming along and.
00:46:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So big change from this time last year.
00:46:46 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, it's a big change and I feel like. There needs to be a way like to, I mean, I guess maybe it's just. I think that the area of improvement is running a regular promotion for TXL, which we just haven't been doing, and I was thinking about that because I was like, we're going to do this event coming up, and yeah, that is definitely on me getting these promotions running. I think part of it is like it's, it's not painful, but I can't think of the word, it's painful. it. That's That's That's That's That's That's And maybe that's not even what I'm trying to say. I think maybe it's like, we've been, I've put so much effort into putting the team together. I guess now is the point where I can look up and say, right, let's run some promotions. my mind just has not been on running promotions for TXL for whatever reason. And I think what I have in mind is like, we're gonna run these boot camps. Cause I know we're gonna do one next month, we'll do another one in the fall for breakthrough advertising. And that'll be how we bring them up.
00:48:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so the boot camps we know has a super high conversion rate, but they're also more work. It's a whole kind of thing, right, to build. But with the podcast now, you have Evergreen stuff, which is what we're talking about. And I don't know what you have going on, but. Um, there are like, I can think of Jeff Roning as an example with, um, whatever his webinar platform as I can't remember what it is. But, and there's some other people where they, um, are constantly promoting it and then send you to a page and it's like, it's closed. Um, but we'll open eventually, put us in your information and get on a waiting list. And so it feels like there's this scarcity. But really like magically 48, 24 hours later, you get a thing, hey, a spot opened up. Um, so there's that type of thing or there's just, you could just have an evergreen offer. And the scarcity is you don't have any more time to waste doing stupid stuff in your business. You don't have any more time to waste, not having a community support you. You don't have any more time to waste doing less than you could be doing. So, you know, instead of being just signing about it or super highly marked. reading about it, whatever, you just be like, this is the thing, you know, this is an exclusive group. We show up steadily. This is not like, if you're looking for XYZ, you know, high peace, slimy, marketing, get rich quick, selling lotto tickets, selling diet pills, meaning promised results that don't actually work and your odds of winning are next to nothing. Don't come in here, we don't want you. But if you want timeless skills, proven tactics, and you're willing to shock, do the work, wear your people, and you should come in here. And it's, you know, at the end of every episode or in the middle or front, middle end of the episodes, whatever. And then you just promote the podcast all over the place. Instead of promoting accelerator, let the podcast show the intelligence and the smarts and all the other things. and say also do you want to actually talk to us in person here so how many podcasters do you get to talk to in person how many people that you listen to as a mentor do you actually get to work with like this is your chance so it could be a very simple marketing campaign that is actually directed at guests right because they see you out there marketing which means they're going to be promoted higher quality guests better content better service to your people better reasons for them to go I got to get in there yep you know just looking we've got we've got a couple of like ad bumps in the podcast the one at the end we'll take listen to a basically
00:52:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
TXL Quiz, and then that puts them into our, if they're a new subscriber, they get welcome sequence and then promotions for TXL and boot camps. But let's see, that puts this quiz, 37, well 37 finished, but only 17 subscribed at the end, 51 started, 37 finished, 17 subscribers, so far.
00:52:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many people have seen it?
00:52:54 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
51.
00:52:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's a good conversion rate. How many people heard the offer to take the quiz?
00:53:07 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I don't know because that comes at the end of the episode. don't know.
00:53:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you get listening analytics?
00:53:20 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I know.
00:53:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there any way to get that?
00:53:25 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I can email Jeremy with that.
00:53:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to put this podcast in and out. But the conversion rate of how many people actually went there versus how many took it. And then how many subscribed?
00:53:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's pretty good. Yeah. So it's. In in like now we're doing and this is just not even a month old now every Wednesday Brian is mailing the list Sending people directly to the to an episode And I that you know that's all the may see and Apple in the Philippines I don't know if I told you I heard this girl named Apple It was a referral from Macy and she she's done pretty well. I trained I Created a right like Brian GPT. Oh, yeah, and She's been using that and then she sends her drafts to Brian Brian edits and and then they they take it I don't touch it at all It's great I love that Yeah, I'll imagine Yeah, yeah So, yeah, I think with Titans, I don't want to get, I guess, my mind, the question is like, all right, know that this runway will end at some point, but like, there's no reason that we can't just keep this community going for as long as Brian, because I think he kind doing these big events, it's like, you know, just doing a better job of maybe running some ads for the podcast, getting people engaging that way, bringing them in, and just doing it simple, and then adding these stick strategies that improve retention is maybe have a bigger... impact overall. But I, you know, talk about protecting my energy. It was something we've talked about a lot like, I'm feeling internally like how much do I want to put into growing titans beyond what it is already versus, you know, that I'm, I see the difference working with Tim and Tim is very like, he's in it, you know, he's driven and it's, it's just a different feeling being part of something like that. Yeah. And they're, they're just constant activity.
00:56:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
very energizing.
00:56:56 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:56:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not only protecting your energy, but feeding your
00:57:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
energy. Yeah, because he's like, you know, we got a, we got a row in the same direction, because we got goals, he's got this event. And it's like, so I, I, that's crossed my mind of like, all right, how do I, you know, manage this tightens, like, what is that going to be? you could just give it a certain amount of time, and you can set your big rocks and goals and say, okay, here are these things that have to converge.
00:57:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Number one, this is how much time and energy I'm willing to give it period and the story. In that time and energy, these are the most important things that have to get done. When the time is up, times up, I've gotten the most thing that can done, it'll be what it'll be. And sink or swim, whatever. If you, if it ends up that you'll Like it needs more and there's money for you, the higher more, but you don't want to give it more. Great. If it's giving a good return and now you want to give it more, give it more. If it's not working, then maybe it's time to have a new conversation and not worry about what you've lost and consider all the things that has fed you, trained you, molded you, shaped you, be grateful for that. thank you everyone because sometimes that needs to happen. There are seasons and sometimes the seasons end.
00:58:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's interesting they're just looking, yeah, this is 3, 4, 6, 3, 2, it's going to look because we, the other thing that has been interesting to watch is you were selling brick-thru advertising mastery on Amazon. And last week, or last month, we almost came close to being completely out of inventory. We sent 20 books at the end of and we were down to one book at the end of May. So I got 30 more. Let's see how many books we have left. So I sent them 30, and some 30 at the end of May. Alright, so we got 23. So we sold 7. But what I was getting at, so this year, I don't know, you gotta go. Let see how many books we sold total because the whole reason we did Amazon was to see if people would buy it and then opt in. So this year total we've generated 23 leads from Amazon whether these are not leads or buyers, but we sold to find this right report here. Let me see how many books we sold. Oh, here we go, me see. Here we go, go, we we we we we go, here we go, here we go, we go, here Uh, the seller central is, um, sales dashboard.
01:02:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There you go.
01:02:12 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You're not here today. I'll do that.
01:02:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's here today. Yeah, that's the same thing as you're today.
01:02:27 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh, I guess I was thinking it would take me back 12 months.
01:02:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I see.
01:02:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
All right. So let's see what we saw. 50, 50 units. And then all right. we're got about half, half of those buyers who opted in. Okay. Um, so what was that last year this time? We weren't on Amazon this time last year.
01:03:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:03:05 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. And we've got ads running on Amazon and those are, let's see.
01:03:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you able to, like, do you tag those opt-ins and can you tell if any of them have purchased Titans Accelerator?
01:03:21 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, we tag them. Oh, God. It started. Keep is forcing two-factor authentication.
01:03:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Starting today.
01:03:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I hate it.
01:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh Do you want to do any of these tags instead of all? No? Oh, never mind.
01:04:37 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Got you got you got you Yeah, I just want to see Anybody to oh no, that's when oh, okay, Tom pools with a real person so one That's that pays out, you know, yeah, that's not Uh Unprofitable And the ads we'll see here the ads have done well to you on Amazon. Oh, here we go We're just doing like yeah 12 bucks a Measurement before Oh This looks 14 sales, this is over this is this year Yeah, all right guys, this is this year So we spent 1400 and we sold 2100 Yeah, so I mean Amazon's been doing well, you're just like, okay, yeah, I mean, what, that's six, seven hundred dollars, it's how much effort does do you put into it, nothing, it's just kind of set it and forget it. Oh, nothing. Yeah, that's good. I I ship, I get a book shipped to them.
01:06:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many people is that? How many customers? Oh, you said it was like 50.
01:06:37 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, this year is like 50, 51. And I found a, well, didn't find it, but the guy who helped me set up the Amazon seller central here, he, I put him on a project to help me find a cheaper printer. For BAM, get down one. in China. I'm meeting with them maybe tonight. But I've already got a copy of the book that they printed for me so I could see their quality and it's really good. I sent it to Brian. He likes it. Of course, he's not sure about printing in China. But it's shipped here. It's less than 10 bucks a book.
01:07:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you were talking about that a while ago.
01:07:35 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
And looking into it. Yeah. I mean, unless I see a major red flag, I want to do it because like that's huge savings. Instant, you know, uh, and I'm.
01:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So glad you started the doc because I feel like we'll get better traction this month, just being able to have some back and forth. But I would really, really like you to consider. And I'm sorry, my daughter came in to see how long and then she let the dog in and he wants to. I don't know how long it's been since you've paid attention to your time and done any time tracking, but it might be good to do a little inventory on where time is going. And especially for summer and maybe just every summer kind of do that although it's going to change with the kids but with that being a teacher, you know it's kind of a good idea to have an idea of how does your schedule change during the summer. And so go ahead and just kind of do a time inventory tracking little bit just it's going to be roughly don't have to do it perfect but just really just pay attention to your time. Where it's going, especially with having the different things going on with tea And that potentially creeping up a little bit, but probably having a good return Seeing what you might want to change in your devotion to it You might want to increase it if it gets out on clickbank and it's doing well I know they're the marketing guys, but you know get your brain on it and going you know what I know some stuff to you Let me put some of this on it put some gasoline on it cuz it's actually really doing good Um stuff you're doing with him potentially getting one more new client to get that extra $5,000 a month buffer But then also making sure you've got time to think about Potentially having conversations with junior copywriters, whatever. So really looking at it and kind of Choosing a pace for the summer choosing the the main goals for the summer what you'd like to accomplish and also in Goals for the family like family trips whatever stuff you guys want to do and just really kind of you know how we've done our time blocking like out in advance. I would love you to kind of try to like if you just spent a few days this week through next week looking at what would I like to get done throughout the summer put them in this spreadsheet with the weeks out right and put the big rocks in there right we're vacation all week not barely touching anything or boot camp whatever like really get the chunks down all through the rest of the summer and then show that to me so that I can look at it with you and just go okay here's some new thoughts about how to part of it will be about how do we how do we give Titans a container that you feel good about but also that you're like okay inside of this can't container I'm going to maximize everything and you get the best but when that containers full, then I get to go play in my other playgrounds, which I'm really enjoying, and you know, so that you don't feel this burden or any building resentment as a result of it, because that does happen. And if you put it into a specifically chosen container, that should reduce the ability and the likelihood of having resentment build up about it, because you've put it where you want it to be and what you're okay with.
01:11:34 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Make sense? Yep.
01:11:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. So just because like we're already getting into July, and you know, that time goes really fast, especially with the kids, and I'm just getting older and faster and faster and faster, I would recommend scheduling out, you know, super rough draft, not major detail. The rest of your summer light that soon, and
01:12:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
and share it with me. OK, I'm in and knowing that. Sheet for myself. We packed a lot into in the May and June or the verification and.
01:12:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, fun.
01:12:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)

Oh, nice.
00:00:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I'm very excited about it. But I have this people that build my deck did not build it right. And so it's very creaky. It's not always been creaky. And that's where I work. And it's driving me bonkers. So now I have to deal with people coming in and out and probably doggies and the doggies like to play tag with the deer around here. They will chase each other up and down the fence. Because if we had some baby deer that were born and they used to sleep under my porch and they've grown up around my dogs.
00:00:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And they will so cool.
00:00:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Chase my dogs and my dogs will chase them. But my dogs will be barking their heads up while it's happening. So it's cute. But also my brain.
00:00:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I love it though.
00:00:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's like deer.
00:00:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Are you kidding me? I remember when I lived in Florida, the golf course community we had deer in our backyard some mornings and beautiful to watch.
00:00:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But they're actually living there. That's That's so cool. I will show you, I'm going to text you a picture of these so you can just kind of see the area.
00:01:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
These are my kiddos and my daughter.
00:01:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going grab my Turn it on. Well, that is my two youngest daughters and my, the one in the back, that's her boyfriend helping them build it. And there's also a tree house that I had built for them up there, which is huge. It's got astroturf and lights inside and papisane chairs and we can see the whole city and It doesn't take a while to get to me because I just turn you on So but so where do you live exactly? Southern Oregon Okay, and so you call it if I'm a falls. It's a dinky little Redneck town is what it is a hillbilly place, and I can't wait to leave but I had babies here, so Years and and so do you have like a big backyard so that though? It's not very big actually so we were resting for a long time after I got divorced I basically found the safest place I could as fast as I could and then they sold it and I didn't get much notice So I had two months to find Finance and close our house Which is that almost snow time. And the criteria primarily was be in our church ward and in our same school district.
00:03:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So that limited it tremendously.
00:03:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it was a beautiful house and it was brand new. So nobody's lived in it. And it's on a hill, which is crazy in the winter because we get a lot of snow. But my kids went from playing outside and playing basketball all the time to day stops playing outside immediately. only moved the block away. But because of the steepness of the hill, these lazy kiddos would not walk up it. So they stopped playing. There's no neighbors that talk and visit. And it's beautiful, but it's just I need them to be where they're engaging with people more and okay, pros and cons to everything.
00:03:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah. So this one they're building.
00:03:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are they building in this picture? That's a gazebo.
00:03:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So it's going to be it's
00:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
going to be, see if I can find a picture to show you what it's going to be, because I also have a really nice couch that goes outside, but the pine tree just keeps dripping sap on it. Well, it would if I didn't keep it covered all the time, but because I keep it covered all the time, nobody wants to deal with the cover and take it off. so this has netting on it. We also have a smoker grill out there, but this is what they're building.
00:04:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, it's going to be gorgeous idea.
00:04:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I already have the lights and everything.
00:04:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Cool.
00:04:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

00:04:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's it. I love it. Yeah. We redid our whole backyard last year to want to make it look like an English magical garden. So we have that we we might still. We'll do the gazebo. We said no at first when the designer suggested it. But just because it's mostly evening when I want to be out there.
00:05:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Come here. Come here. Come here.
00:05:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)

Oh, cute.
00:05:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's my that's my Baha'nies boy. Okay.
00:05:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
English, English garden.
00:05:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I saw picture with your mom or a video. She was smelling her roses and it looked so peaceful and nice back there.
00:05:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It is. Yeah. We're in a really small town here too in Canada. yeah, it's nice. And my mom's backyard. Actually, I worked from her house yesterday afternoon and she was just cute thing because like she goes to take a nap in the afternoon and then and it was really bad rain. Like we've had flooding here and everything. But it. So you're not at about three o'clock yesterday, all of a sudden five o'clock, she comes down and her bathing suit like, what are you doing? It's five o'clock and she goes, I'm going for a swim. I'm tired of being inside the house all day. know, I'm like, Mom, you have more energy than me.
00:06:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you're amazing. It's the naps, Maria.
00:06:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
powerful. It must be because I was just amazed. was just like, here she comes. she's 88 years old and she just, yeah, come down down and get her bathing suit and just goes and swims, jumps in the pool. I'm like, Oh my God. And then she's like, how come you don't have bathing suit here? So I know, you know what? I'm going to go buy second one and just keep it there. Cause I probably would have joined her, right?
00:06:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I told my friend to do. Cause I have a friend and she comes in Queens for me on Friday because she's amazing and an organizer and so smart. Anyway, I talked her into it and pay her good, but I'm like, I'm swimming with me. yeah, yeah, like that water sunshine. I don't need a lot else.
00:06:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. know, that's right.
00:06:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I've been excited about this. I tried to be productive. I'm telling you, the beginning of my existence is not having people to work with. It didn't used to be a problem for me, but the older I get, the more it gets like that. I think part of it also is after getting into this transitionary phase, I really feel my emotions coming on, I'm annoyed by it. But since my older girls have moved out and I haven't had the chaos at home. And the energy of all these people, because I left the workplace, that was difficult. Then the kids got bigger, know, I had four of them. And so that filled me up. But now they're gone most of time. The two are the two oldest are gone all the time and the two youngest are gone most of the time. And so I wasn't aware of how much I was feeding off of their energy, even when they weren't in the room.
00:08:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Got it. Got it.
00:08:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's annoying. I'm not really a cry baby, but like my emotions are I worked so hard to not suppress them anymore.
00:08:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I purposely let them be free, but it's really annoying when it's this one.
00:08:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'll cry when I'm mad. I'll cry when I'm happy.
00:08:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'll cry when away.
00:08:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So like, I've got to figure out. I don't have enough work to hire somebody regularly. And I'm like, if I just get one more client, I'll just pay somebody just to sit there with me.
00:08:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But I need riffing.
00:08:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need somebody to sit there and hammer things out. And I've never needed that before, because I had energy around me. I didn't know that I was literally drawing energy from their presence, even just being in the house. But I'm very conscious of but now because I noticed when I'm productive, it's when they're here and they're busy doing stuff, even if we're not together, I'm like, I can do stuff. They'll be gone all week long. And I'm like, I'm gonna get so much stuff done, get nothing done. The second they get home, like, boop, boop, boop, boop.
00:09:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, interesting. Yeah, so that's where I've been, like I'm not really not getting a lot done, but I did work with chat GBT last night.
00:09:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get these little spurts where something pops to my brain and I will capture it. But that's basically as productive as it gets. I won't sit down and do things. But because you asked me, let me go to my notes here. to be crying, whatever. me look somewhere from my face, stop the leap. What are you, what's that? There's a child. Anyway, so talking about a welcome video, you said to think about video training and structure. so what I was thinking, Let me close this, is that, sorry, I'm not on my normal computer, I'm on my laptop, so I have to kind of like organize everything better for this to crank drive minutes. So, think about video training and structure, and so, I was thinking about this, and I think that no matter what entry point, somebody comes in with me, there are, there are going to be some key principles that I want them to understand before we go forward, because I want them to complete whatever they came here for, because it's always their time otherwise. And so, the thing that I know, wow, that was, sorry, okay, the thing that I know is that, in order for us to do things, we have to be committed to it, so we have to buy into it. Otherwise, it's just a momentary fluke, you know, they're in the moment, like how many times Time is your brain committed to something and your 10 minutes later is like, I'm not the same person.
00:11:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We're not doing that. Yeah.
00:11:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but if I get buy-in, I kind of get buy-in to the spirit, not just the energy of that moment. So, I think in the beginning, I want to tell them when they get there, okay, so and so you sign up for this, whether it's paid or free, whatever it is that we're doing. And the reason that you did it is because there's a result that you want. And there's a result that you want because there's something missing that you don't have or there's something present that you don't want or both. Okay. So, here's how we're going to get it, but let me explain to you why working with me and going through what I'm teaching you is a little bit different. I'm going to explain to you leverage. And I'm going to explain it very quickly, explain what a lever is, and explain how it's doing working you. that's almost impossible making it very simple by applying pressure to a device, a device being a system, a structure, a process, whatever. But I'm actually going to have like a little picture or maybe a jiff that shows a very simple lever, a stick, a rock, a heavy thing, and they're like, you can't move the rock and then you push pressure on the lever, boom, the rock goes up. That's leverage. Most people are not ever thinking about leverage. And if they are thinking about it, it's not constantly, it's not persistently, it's not intentionally. Because everything that I do is leveraged, always looking to increase my leverage. I'm always, people talk about working smarter, not harder, but how do you do it? It's levers. It is what devices can you use that gets more from less. So I want to teach that to them very quickly. Like we just cover that maybe two minutes, but they should be engaged in it. Most of their brain. are going to be like, you were listening, they're probably going to be listening, like, I can get more from less. And you're telling me how people always tell me I should, but they don't tell me how.
00:13:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah.
00:13:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or why it's simple or why it can happen. So they just learn something new. first few seconds that they're there with me.
00:13:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:13:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The next thing is I'm going to tell them I need you to consider energy. This is a resource that we all have. But as you know, it fluctuates. It's sometimes unreliable. It's sometimes not there when you need it to be. But most people think about energy retroactively. I want them to think of it proactively. I am always thinking about energy. I am thinking about tomorrow's energy today. And I'm doing everything I can to maximize today's energy and tomorrow's energy and making my choices consciously so that I have sufficient, if not, plenty of energy to be able to do all the things that are most important to me. And then the next thing I'll tell them about priorities because how do I have energy for the things that are most important to me if I have it consciously and intentionally chosen what is most important to me. So, so-and-so name, we're going to go through an exercise, a series of exercises that are very quick, that are very succinct like the things that I just explained to you that are going to help you sort and filter the current activities that you have so that you can learn how to prioritize them and so that you can learn how to leverage your time to get the most out of it in the least amount of effort as well as maximize your energy. And this might seem like a big ask and that it's a lot to do but what I can tell you is and I promise you that if you will spend whatever time it takes to get to this. Some people can get through it in 10 minutes. Some people take, you know, two hours. But if you take the time to go through and organize these, to complete this task because I don't want to overwhelm them with describing it yet, then I guarantee you, you're going to have a shift in the way that you spend your time and the way that you spend your energy and you will think about it differently forever from this point on. But when you think about it differently, it's going to be so clear in your mind about how you can do differently. when you, here's the thing, if you want to be different, you have to do something different. But if you want that different to be good and strategic, then the difference that you do has to be good and strategic. And I'm going to tell you, without knowing your business, without being over your shoulder, I'm going to show you how you can custom tailor, not according to what I I think is important, but what is important to you, your activities so that you get more from less of your time and so that you have more energy and more peace while you're doing your activities, your work activities, business, whatever. I'll improve that script a little bit, but basically that's it and then send them through the exercise and then have a closing one. Like, okay, this is not, so first of all, I want you to pause for a minute and I want you to ponder and reflect on what did you experience? What was your aha moment? I would like you to write down your ahas. What were your epiphanies? did you notice that maybe you didn't notice before? What did you notice about how you should not be spending your time or how you should be spending your time? What did you notice about energy and what could be altered and improved? Now what we're gonna do is go through and apply this. I want you to do, sort your activities according to, you know, what we just did, and then I want you to spend the next 30 days operating with this new awareness. But what I want you to do again in 30 days, and maybe you're not an overachiever and maybe you want to do it in 90 days, but you want to come back to this activity soon, and what you want to do is the same activity. You want to take stock again of where your time is going, how it's impacting your energy, how it's impacting your profits, because now they've had it all explained to them that it's energy profits, time, all this stuff that they're looking at. And ask yourself, because now you're a new person, you're a new person tomorrow, you're a new person 30 days from now, you're a new person 90 days from now, and I want you to go back through this activity and go, is there something else I'm not paying attention to that I'm not aware of? And what I can promise you is that you will have changed, you will have a new epiphany So if you continue to do this, this is called an iteration, we make a new change, we make a new improvement, and if you continually do that, and maybe it's not every 30 days, maybe sometimes it's every three months, and maybe one day it's six months later, and maybe life got crazy and it's a year later. But thing about this is that I'm going to teach you timeless principles. You can go back and apply anything I'll ever teach you, and every time you apply it, you will have an improvement, because you will have changed in your awareness and understanding will have increased, and so your ability to apply the timeless principle will improve the results. So it doesn't matter, if you're really consistent about doing it, if you're more consistent, you get better results, but every time you do it, you will get good results.
00:18:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, so, so Breaking that out. I I started taking notes here. So so video ones about leverage video to energy and priorities to shift To shift you away like how you spend time how you think about your time And you're gonna kind of have them do exercises in that video too during video too By the way, like it everything you just said first of all Overall summary, but I went into like okay.
00:19:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's let's create this mode. Okay mechanical mode.
00:19:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
get it. I'm good Yeah, yeah. so so yeah, like just real quick Rather than just drawing. I just want to start this little document. So Energy and and here you'll you'll do also talk about yourself and success stories, right? Okay our results So energy and priorities shift away, okay, so and then come back in three days since activity repeat Take stock where time is going how it's impacting your problems. It's all this in video too and the exercises.
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I didn't break these up. What we could do is I could just make whatever comes out and then we cut it if cutting is needed. But what I was imagining is the leverage energy and priorities is all in the welcome video because all of that is a preface to what we're about to do.
00:20:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And it's very short. I cover it in less than five minutes.
00:20:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it could be broken into chapters or it could be broken into short of videos. But I really do think it needs to be a contained thing because this is the before you start you need to have this. It's a micro lesson.
00:20:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Five minutes is still very short.
00:20:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it is a timeless lesson in and of itself. Leverage, energy priorities, and learning how to maximize those and also the concept of persistence and consistency. which are not the same thing. Persistence is how energetically you're at it, right? drive for it. Consistence is frequency. they're both separate elements, but if they're both present, those are productivity amplifiers and magnifiers and multipliers. So that's what makes it leveraged also when there's persistence behind it.
00:21:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Persistence is a leverage.
00:21:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Consistency is a lever. So, but these are not, this is not how people are thinking. Most people don't think this way, which is why when I get the new clients I've been getting are attorneys and doctors and they're paying me a thousand dollars an hour and their minds are blown. And so like I, in my point, is not anything. It's just that these are some of them are Ivy League and They're still not thinking like this. My point is that this is not, people aren't trained this way, but once they have the understanding, these are not difficult concepts and these people are not too stupid to understand this. It is, it's just not taught and given. And so anyway, anybody could apply it to any type of business, any type of activity, any type of stewardship and they will be better, they could be a soccer coach and this would help them. This would help them. You know what I mean? Like any stewardship that you have, leaders said, this is how I think I'm going to be arrogant, but I'm probably arrogant.
00:22:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, I'm sure it would help a lot. I guess the thing I'm thinking in my mind is just, yeah, let's get the training done and out there and start having people go through it to get the more testimonials and stuff for it.
00:22:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, it's just sitting down and getting it done, but I need to just sit down and get it done. Today. It'd be a good day. I just I need to do day. You like just give me do they say Tina? need you to have X done by X and be aggressive about it because I could do it. I need I need accountability. need help. Please.
00:23:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:23:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:23:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So so two questions. Yeah, we can give you deadline is and the first question is is in one week good enough like by Tuesday next week.
00:23:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yeah.
00:23:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because it should take a total of like four hours or less. Like it could be one hour. But I know myself sometimes it condense 60 minutes of concepts into a five minute video more valuable than just blabbing away for 60 minutes.
00:23:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I don't mean think it'll be an hour.
00:23:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I already have a video for this. Actually, I just want to make it for it's way better now. So it's all years ago and it was like 20 minutes. So let's have a deadline of a week from Tuesday. Yep. Oh, Friday. Okay.
00:23:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Friday. Awesome.
00:23:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I could have it done by tomorrow.
00:23:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. But I won't push myself.
00:24:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like I have What's today Tuesday? Yeah, yeah, and the second question is for you to get this done will be better, would it be better for us to just do a working session where I go. Okay, go create video one right now and let's come back in half an hour. Okay, let's do that. So, so, yeah, go create video one right now and then let's reconvene right now.
00:24:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's Well, normally that would be good today because of the work situation.
00:24:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Gotcha.
00:24:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. But but we could say, you know, create first draft today. Let's have a working session tomorrow. Like we can even wrap it up if you want to because I don't want to monopolize your time. I paid for a certain amount and I don't want to use that. Yeah.
00:24:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What? Go ahead. Tomorrow's wide open after 12 noon my time.
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, I didn't get around, yeah, my brain, Maria, oh, so I'm taking my daughter to girls camp tomorrow. That's early in the morning. And, um, the heck is that? Oh, so I found a co-working thing yesterday, actually. Oh, cool. And, um, it's called flow dock club, I think.
00:25:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:25:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to try doing something like that.
00:25:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
totally forgot about it already.
00:25:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But, um, flow dot club, I'll go to the website. Yeah, go look at that.
00:25:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Right. We're going to get your work done. Go get focused free. Oh, that's cool.
00:25:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It seems like different people create their own sessions and their types of sessions. that they want. So this one that I chose, it's called 120 minutes, finished strong flow club with Lex, and she's like a law student or something. And so they have five minutes of briefly sharing goals with the group, 50 minutes of doing solo focus work on mute, five minutes celebrating at the end. And I was like, that's perfect.
00:26:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's amazing. This is amazing.
00:26:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:26:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, I really need that.
00:26:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So.
00:26:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Wow.
00:26:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:26:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Right. Yeah, I like it.
00:26:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but then I meant if it was today, that'd be even better. I don't know how they're, how long they're gonna be working on this because even though, but I imagine it's gonna be a while and that's just a major brain disruptor.
00:26:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, no, I get it. I get it.
00:26:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like if I have my cleaner here and sometimes just ask me questions. Oh, I know. Yeah. Oh, you're going to hair appointment is white going with you. Are they still working? I'll pay you all. I love you. Bye. Have fun. I love her hair done. Okay, so hasn't told me what time she wants to be for girls camp tomorrow and it's 45 minutes away. So I really Don't know what my availability is until I know at least she'll be there by 10.
00:27:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I at least we'll be back by 11 My time so noon my time is to wake up. Wait, what time did you say you're available? Yeah, like after 12 noon Um, nine a.m. So If you're available after 12 noon, your time that's three o'clock, my time that works. I go up till about five o'clock. And then Thursday, Thursday after 2.30 PM, after 11.30 AM your time.
00:28:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I have a call with Dan from 12 to 1 on Thursdays, but then I'm done after that. So if you have that time block tomorrow at noon, and I hate to ask for a tentative time, but I'm okay if you can't do it. But if we're just reviewing what there is and then, because honestly, if I finished it, I'll just send it to you and say, here's what we thought. And so it doesn't necessarily have to be a fixed time. We can just do kind of a back and forth for the most part. And then if... I can experiment with that flow session and see if that's helpful, but basically what I need for me. Okay, so your offer super , by the way, was, you know, it takes you 18 or whatever, 180 hours. I don't remember to come up. was a structure and a format of things that need to get and things that you would extract and then this is what we've got out. So the bullet point of even that mental focus of, okay, these are the things that we need to have. So you go, you know, Tina, you go create this and then you're telling me if you tell me what you're doing, that will help me just go, okay, these are my containers.
00:29:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I need to go fill them up.
00:29:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And is there, I don't even like, if I could look at the sales page, I'd go back and look at that. Epic, could you help me figure out what the structure is and what, what all I want to need to do and like, how do we get to the finished product? So I know if I create it, the, I create the training, um, then there's, there's copy and there's all these other things. What parts do you do? What parts are we doing together?
00:30:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:30:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
been a thing.
00:30:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So basically, um, I'll, and you're kind of a rare breach that you're going to So like, I kind of do the copy and, but you know, you, like, you might have something that's like stellar to write instead or add to it, et cetera. Um, less is more in these little $3 things. keep in mind it's really just a headline bullet points stuff. And then, um, I will like, uh, help put together basically, like once you have the training done, like I can kind of just take a look at it and. Just, it's more just review what you've done, like, like, again, you're kind of every that you're very experienced all this. So it's more like, is there a worksheet or success action that needs to be better or added to it to make sure there's consumption, right? my biggest thing about this is like, how many people are really going to use it? So there's that. And as far as getting it done, yeah, like I'll do the sales page and even the technical set up of it and the reality is, again, then what's the order bump going to be? So I help strategize like what the offer portfolio is. So what the order bump should be and then what is the what's after they buy the $3 thing, whether or not they buy the order bump or not, they land on either a thanks page or like upsell one page. So typically what's not in scope, obviously, is crafting up to the one upsell too for you. But typically what a lot of people do, and I even suggest that even for the, like, product boss who've made a million dollars with their $37 offer, right, is they first started with just the front end thing, and then it wasn't up. So one was just a thank you page for the first month. And then after that, they added. So what you could do on the thinking page, like we just need to figure out what what you want to send them into. So it could be, you know, book a call and into, you know, your private coaching, it could be, you know, just for now, love how creating hybrid coaching, like, I don't know what it looks like, and how much of your time I can buy, and how much of your help I could have that being able to stay focused and basically getting through the offer creation.
00:32:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If I can implement this co-working so I've got, you know, something to help me do my stuff where I don't need your high level brain. But I tend to overthink offers, and copy. I do know less is more, but I also know that long copy does a really good job when somebody needs more time to be convinced so I go through a gamut of logic and I just go like that. But I also know that done is better than perfect and perfect isn't real. But because I get stuck in my head having somebody just go, well, this works. Let's try this. You know, this is what I do with my people.
00:33:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, let's just try it. Like, you don't know. Yeah, that's kind of what that is. Just try it. That's kind of what this is because like, what I, to be honest, what I kind of foresee for you for just a cadence, I really feel this is that it'd be cool because you're also your energy so amazing live and zoom and stuff. It'd be cool if like, end result, six months from now, what's the cadence look like? That, And also from the customer journey point of view is that they come in and two ways to get access to you from cold, right? Is either buying the $3 thing and remember you're still building your list because the way the $3 thing is they opt in, right? For it before they buy so they're gonna have lot of abandoned carts Which is still on your list and that person might buy something else for me And and then you have once a month like a mid ticket like a hundred dollar maybe live workshop once a month. That's it So you're starting to build an offer portfolio from that because if the workshop is slightly different every month not the same one Those things can become you're up. So one you're up cell to see how we're kind of the case But also I'm riding on something else here. That's interesting We're in a weird and year into this also because your your love of psychology and everything and trends Um 2024 and 2025 26 we're in a weird movement moving forward because with AI and everything. Yeah, content online is a commodity like anybody like you know a 16 year old kid could pretend to be a 45 year old and say I made a million dollars and put up a bunch of content and you know whatever do okay so I think we're shifting to A that's why I like the $3 thing people want some immediate thing for cheap right to get to know you yeah low-risk yeah and they get a taste of your stuff but be also some live access to you because authenticity sells right so so in that live access you know is engineered like I'll get to the group coaching session for second but but if it's once a month like this workshop you don't have to do this for the rest of your life you actually building up all these other little products that can be sold and then also the workshops can be recorded and chair won't go up sorry and so that becomes part of the concert That library anyway, my brain will exactly exactly. And then if you're going to this, this is actually, I'm actually re visualizing my own micro offer kind of business to is is and I like this concept is that then you go to the hybrid coaching that's way more high ticket, like maybe it's a hundred bucks a week or 250 a week with you and you're only doing in your game for this to, you know, live coaching a month. But they get access to you. We can figure out what the pricing is and stuff, but because I know you're really good at that, like, because that really resonated with me last week about the value, right? so discounting. But you know, you could have some more high end kind of group container coaching that is not like open, close, open, close.
00:36:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's more like it's there.
00:36:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I don't like that game and also can't talk about consistency.
00:36:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, do that. So it's out of alignment. with my other principles to do.
00:37:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. so the monthly workshops can also be built based on kind of the feedback you're getting from people. Like you could have a beta, beta founders join my, you know, XYZ program, you know, Go ahead.
00:37:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was just going to say what I like about it being so low ticket filling it up is that what what is really difficult for me is low energy. So, so like when I show up to alive and I've done group training and there's hardly anybody there and everyone's quiet, it drives me nuts. I can talk to myself. I want to. I don't enjoy just hearing the sound of my voice that you wouldn't know because I don't shut up. But this energy, it's because of you. Like, because you're here and not just because a person is here, but a person with an amazing mind and personality and values, I'm feeding off of that. So if there's nobody in there or there's a couple of people or their weak energy, like I really want to be able to fill up a room.
00:38:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:38:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Again, back to I draw energy from kids that are here, and I'm not even with them. Like I'm very sensitive to energy. But also, as you've experienced, I can project it, which is why I'm never afraid of AI because no type of AI has spiritual soulful energy. And I do know that my translates through text even.
00:38:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know how.
00:38:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know why, but I know that when people read my words, even just the words change them. Pure text, no images. So, you know, like I'm excited for that, but I also have to keep it in the energy container of, I can't build a framework that requires too much of my time. I need to leverage my time so that yeah, whatever access people get to me. Um, what I wanted to be is an environment where the energy is there for them to top into because even if they are aware that they're feeling the energy and being benefited by the energy, they're still being benefited by it. They don't have to. They just need to feel it and that they're getting so, so one of the things that I've learned is that where most people just kind of throw a grenade at a business or they just make you want to overhaul everything, I'm taking surgical cuts, that's what the leverage is. So anyway, but I really want to be able to find a way to work with you long term. I don't think I need a lot of your time and maybe because we were talking about the CEO of the Spicy Brain CEO being separate, but and I would love to serve you if there would be a way that you would like to use my brain, I would be happy to just share it. Find like I'm not opposed to paying obviously. Yeah. Yeah, not what I mean, but whatever it is Maria I really I want to spend more time doing this together. I would love to support you So to separate I have a habit of converging things and this needs to have its container But anyway, I get excited when you talk about it and those offers that makes logical sense to me And I'm excited because this is what I need Cool. Yeah, so so no, it's cool So yeah, and I definitely think that too because I think you could help me a lot on focusing and in your time management stuff and just You know, yeah, so so now so really what we're talking about is sort of like you're just selling Different levels of access to yourself right like is the three-dollar thing You know is like there's just your training right in the worksheets, you know, but I do have more training So just just because my work on Yeah semantics of it and logistics of it like there is definitely more training to be had that doesn't need to have access. Yeah, because I think that I can train it in video very well. And I think that my energy and my experience have been that even in video and it doesn't have to be live, the energy is still contagious. Yeah, infectious, you know, and so I do think that they're on the spectrum are more levels of it's not access to me per se, but just to the training and that there's always an upsell of access with whatever level of training they're getting. yeah. But there's definitely more modular type stuff that we can sell and package and put together. And if I do these co-working sessions, I can hammer them out because I can do the stuff in my sleep. Yeah, have the energy, just the energy. Yeah, anyway, so that help kind of Yes, we're selling access to me. Yes, there's a spectrum of it and the price point, but we also can sell just the information and the training. That's a lot of words to insert that. Sorry.
00:42:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, no, I got it. That's good. good. um, yeah. So I think, I think, yeah, first up, let's just get the training part done, the $3 thing done. um, you said, your clients just get out there.
00:42:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I'll get it out there. Okay.
00:42:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And just, so, and just close things off. um, when are we, it's kind of potentially tomorrow, right? And you're just going to text me.
00:42:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what, how about we do this because I, I don't, um, can we schedule it for Thursday or even, um, Friday? And do just email communication back and forth, because I think if I create something, we don't need to be on a call for you to say, you know, you need to go create this, like, I just need you to be able to review it. And then to me calls are for brainstorming, clarity, you know, things that can't be done through email or vox or even I love the audio messages, because I don't like I love talking to you. I love that. If I if I can just get the stuff done, I'd rather have your time for riffing, you know, that type of thing that can't be accomplished the other way.
00:43:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I agree.
00:43:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I agree. Okay. how about we don't even schedule anything yet. I'll get my work done. And then the only way to get access to your time is to get my work done.
00:43:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yep. And Friday's your deadline. Okay. All right.
00:43:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cool. Love it.
00:43:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Thanks. All right.

> 00:00:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay, can you hear me?
00:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, can you hear me? How are you doing?
00:00:11 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Getting a little tired of all the body blows. Gotta be honest. Been a lot of stuff for the last two or three weeks.
00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's going on?
00:00:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
We have the Washington Bar Company, the New Mexico lawsuit in Bar Company. Tyler potentially missing the statue. Tyler slash Nate slash cat. Potentially missing the statue. Friday getting an earful from Sweet James because they also signed the client of ours and got mad that we were trying to write their name when that wasn't the case, so we're hearing that out at 12 today, but that's a minimum $200,000 loss for me, which sucks. It is what it is. And we kind of like... The survey cases that are relatively new, email us, tell us that they don't want to be represented in. And what about HQ intake? We're still sending our leads to HQ intake and they're going to us, so we're doing double work. So it's just getting the point where it's a lot.
00:01:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, what's good?
00:01:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Um, great to have a big check last month. That's always good. We've signed up a good number of cases last month, despite having a lot of drops and subouts, so that's still good. We put together a new incentive plan that we rolled out to the staff, so it should be good. Obviously, it costs us money, but hopefully we'll get everyone incentivized to try to get the goals together. Oh, I took a new job with a pain doctor, so that'll be good for her. And yeah, that's what I got.
00:02:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tell me about the incentive plan, and is that going to increase payroll?
00:02:35 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. By about 15 grand a month.
00:02:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A percentage is that.
00:02:46 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Payroll or.
00:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Total so payroll was around 37% what's it now?
00:02:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't have last month number yet. Because it's on the bed, so there's still. I know that her payroll last month was really high and give you a rough estimate of what it was.
00:03:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:03:48 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, we also have someone trying to commit fraud against her trust account. So that's cool. Sorry, Arizona. Trying to pay their gas belt with our. Where they're trusted, yeah.
00:04:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:04:10 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Awesome.
00:04:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's. Okay. Okay.
00:04:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay, we were. California was two. Seventy eight before taxes and everything else. They were buying good taxes. Oh, the employee benefits, Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. And You $409,113.
00:06:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What was your revenue for July?
00:06:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
$1.1. $1. $1. So, I'm, is this short?
00:07:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, now we're 40 percent and when did that get rolled out?
00:07:40 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Thursday. So, yeah, sign in this.
00:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's, what's changed in the structure?
00:08:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
They hit both money angle and settlements, it's a thousand of each person. If they want hit one of them, it's 500.
00:08:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One of the stats on hitting those goals across the teams.
00:08:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It hit it three or four months this year. It's not every time, but it's frequent enough that it's not impossible, I guess. It's definitely doable. I think done it multiple times. Thanks
00:09:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I don't think that that's, I think it's a good thing to me. I mean, obviously, you did too because you did it, but that makes sense to me, that I mean, I guess it just depends on how much revenue difference that makes money and goals and settlement.
00:09:30 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What's the settlement goal? Three million.
00:09:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:09:36 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
The logic is not every case that settles you're going to paid out right away, just because it takes We made it clear that the goals will increase over time. Right. We're adding more people. or adding more states, writing more cases, like it's not going to stay this way.
00:10:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Will the payment increase or just the expectations?
00:10:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I think just the expectations because quite frankly, for adding more people and more teams, it's hard to justify increasing the amount per person when we're adding more people. It doesn't make sense.
00:10:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Talking to, I assume that you would have had a conversation with your attorneys about this. So wait, let me ask this first of all, in Patrick's team probably won't even have enough to get to those goals. It's a real wide goal. And then the attorneys that are already paying out of pocket for their teams for their incentive program or are they going to Okay, this what?
00:11:02 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
This is separate from that.
00:11:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What I what I was asking is, would you think that they're going to pull back what they're already doing or keep that the same?
00:11:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I've talked to them and they've all said they're going to keep the same.
00:11:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so who does that besides Samantha and Marin's?
00:11:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Nick doesn't because it doesn't really make sense given their volume. Patrick isn't on a percentage. So it wouldn't make sense for him to do it and Hank doesn't. Again, a percentage to noon.
00:11:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. This doesn't take away from them. I wouldn't see why they would do it other than just being short-sighted and thinking that that would be How much do they pay out, do you know individually each month to their teams and internet programs?
00:12:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know exactly. Sam's a little better because she gives part of her quarterly bonus to them. She has 6,000 divided by her team and she'll pull us out like during the month. Tyler is more ad hoc. I think he's probably giving his team a round of grand that total.
00:12:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so the people I have on Samantha's team is Thelma, Valerie, Victoria, and Jalissa.
00:12:43 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
that still correct? No, Jalissa never wanted, never ended moving over. She made more money doing it and take the script.
00:12:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so does she only have three people?
00:12:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
She's got Liz helping her a little bit. we've got Liz training with her before that is kind of cool. time would think.
00:13:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And in what role? Can you send it right?
00:13:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Sure.
00:13:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. Just helping. Yeah. I was Hank doing.
00:13:29 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Um, we've got a standing meeting every Wednesday to go through his cases and what's going on. So I talked a little bit on Wednesday last week, um, going through his cases, kind of how these are built. New cases look okay. he's just trying to scrape some of these, you know, crack their cases through. Uh, he had, not a complaint, but, you know, said it was a little tough with him in the same office, even though the office is made for four people. Um, just because sometimes they're working around. each other and we get a little loud if they're both on the phone, so we end up just getting her a separate office. They're on like a scene like what they're near each other.
00:14:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's that gonna cost you different?
00:14:24 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
600 bucks a month. It's not enough to worry about to keep two people happy. I would agree. One thing he did say, which I did find interesting and was actually kind of also anyway, he said that clients have been showing up to the office, like they want to come in more. And so I was talking to Steve, he's like, yeah, our Phoenix office, like clients love to come in. Like it's weird, no other place they do that, but in the Phoenix area they love to come in. So, I think longer term is actually a good thing having a Phoenix office, so it should help us with retention and hopefully with the hurdles.
00:15:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or be more of a bottleneck because it slows things down and people get more chatty. That be interesting to see if there's less sub-out or if there's more referrals from the Phoenix office from previous customers, things like that, would be really interesting to see how, what the correlations are to anything, very interesting, so let me go look at this. Pink's not even on the team, and I look at matters by team, hold on, yeah, that's this year.
00:16:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So, because we started to give them about one or two new cases a week.
00:16:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What was the first thing you said before giving one or two?
00:16:23 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You have some because it's getting one or two weeks, so it definitely has cases.
00:16:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So. Screen to real quick. So this is one of the newer reports that. Did he actually say is the newest report I think. So I don't know how accurate this is or. it was made from zoom out of the way more. Okay, so these are the teams, it's finding, how would I see what criteria this report is using? If I edit, maybe.
00:17:21 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And it's probably not going to the resolution closed because he's just starting to get his own cases.
00:17:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So, let's see, okay, so it probably just wouldn't even be in here.
00:17:38 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Also, it looks like he doesn't have his own matter team as he's principal, so I'll talk about that.
00:17:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Oh. Got that.
00:17:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. So, if you wanted to, like, map.
00:18:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
as a report?
00:18:04 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, just letter in general.
00:18:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, sorry, where do you mean?
00:18:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
There's home, chatter. Oh, yeah.
00:18:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:18:15 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And then I recently viewed if you just click where it says you're telling you to left.
00:18:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
00:18:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And then just type in hang. Yep. You can see his list.
00:18:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. So he's got a 50. And status, no.
00:18:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Yeah, they're not using that thing. Progatory was what was supposed to be for soccer to take a look at.
00:18:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just think it's funny.
00:19:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
the file but the offers aren't good enough to take so it's okay.
00:19:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, just making it this. I haven't like did this report like this before so that was interesting. All right, so we can probably stop screen sharing and hey, have you heard from Fuji today?
00:19:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Today?
00:19:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Well, he, oh, okay, he slept through his alarms.
00:19:42 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He missed my call, so.
00:19:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, you baby. Yeah, I'm not mad about it. figured I just wanted to make sure it wasn't something bad. So, you know, mean, new babies are something.
00:19:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
We talked to him again because he got his car. He was doing drier than having fun.
00:19:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, No, and I heard from him yesterday, but he he messaged that he just messaged. I just thought that he slept through his alarm. So it's okay. I'll check in with him. just want to make sure they were okay. So, um, okay, so new incentive program. That's good. You about how are I said, how are you doing? And you're like, okay, body blows, all that stuff. overall, really, how do you feel Um, trying to think of how to formulate that question right now, it just feels little demoralizing, right?
00:20:39 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's just like, you keep pushing and pushing and pushing and Definitely feel like you're moving backwards to some level. What's the point of doing all this stuff and having all this stress when it's just, you know, making progress? Um, it sure lives. I'll get over it. It's just All I want
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, comes in waves like that's exactly right that's exactly right. So, um, I mean, that's, that's perfect. That's just, did I tell you we had another accident? My, my daughter caught in another accident. So we have three, three and three weeks. I'm a place where you can't do any help. Anyway, point being that the craziness, that's exactly how it happens. It's just their seasons, ebbs and flows, and it's wild, but your perspective of, of that, that that that comes and goes being able to recognize that being able to put that into perspective and not let it overwhelm you. I mean, you can't not feel the things you've. can be numb, but that doesn't really serve a good function because then you can't block out specific feelings, you block everything or nothing. I mean, effectively. So just being able to put that into perspective. So last week, hold on, we started talking about that. That's not even the right note, the heck. Um, goals. Did you read Emith again? Or did I ever have you read it? I feel like you said you had read it once before.
00:22:53 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
There's two books.
00:22:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Emith I have. not read not So, you still have it?
00:23:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I already, I haven't had a chance to read it yet.
00:23:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:23:08 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And you can just say that for like what I'm traveling, it's just easy to, you know.
00:23:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And do you have a target for when that can happen? Probably next week. Because I'm traveling next week. And when was the last time you read EMIS?
00:23:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's been a while. I just remember there's like an entrepreneur, the manager and the technician. And like you can be all three, but really focus on one of them. And become good at it and make sure you have the other two.
00:23:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Go find mine and remind myself.
00:24:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
is about like the person who wants to like know more. So the person who like works on your business instead of in your business, is always big.
00:24:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to go to my librarian. It's been a while since I read it, too, in that way. And it's always interesting, though, too, that people pick different things out of books. Now I'm trying to remember where I'm going to find my notes, though. where we landed on just talking about the goals, although I think where you want to go with your business and that's not solidified and we talked about purpose a little bit and then I asked you some questions. let me go back to that because that was offline so I didn't put it in my notes and I need to. And you did not reply back to me. So I asked, what did you think about those two things that I mentioned?
00:25:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Yeah, that was better than people. It's just a short answer.
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is it?
00:26:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Dogs are better than people.
00:26:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't hear you disagreeing. Okay, so I mean dogs can be your purpose. That's not a judgment. I just am looking for specificity. And I would like you to work on that and generally the reasons that will resist specificity around purpose will be internal judgment or fear of external judgment.
00:26:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, I just don't want someone else to go through what I went through and if they have to to have the easier route than what I wonder. It's really what it comes down to. So these are good people generally speaking who want to make the world a better place and they have skills and talents that I don't have. And so if I can bring something to it to connect these things and to help, then it's what I want to do.
00:27:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you realize what you're prioritizing there? That it's not dogs.
00:27:32 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It is to some level because it's the overall goal. These are the people that I would need to be able to get the outcome that I'm looking for.
00:27:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I'm missing something then. Oh, let me go like this.
00:27:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
If you're trying to build a technical project, right? You'd want someone who's like a CTO. or someone who has a technical background, generally speaking, if you're trying to build some sort of new technology. In this situation, that would be the surgical vet or Sayaka for like better term.
00:28:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, these are actually the two. So, of dogs, speaking of dogs. No, I missed my beach on so, oh, no, can't talk about that.
00:28:38 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'll cry. I'm feeling. So, again, for me, if it's a way to help, and all these people come together because they have a skill that I don't have to try to get. it's the outcome that I want. Well, still, you know, there's advantages for me, right? There's tax advantages for the potential business that there's other things going on. It's not pure altruism. But, you know, the main motive here is not necessarily to make as much money as it possibly can for me.
00:29:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so I was just trying to sort though because there are two things that in what you were sharing with me is there having dogs that longer lives and have, you know, better quality lives, but also just because of what dogs give to people. the greater purpose to you is just, and this is not when I say just I don't mean it as a judgment at all. The primary focus would be on dogs. People take care of dogs so they don't get better quality lives unless people are taking care of them. the people are just kind of the means to an end and the end is just the best life for a dog. Yes, do I? Okay, um, yeah. So, and here's another question I haven't asked you about. What other businesses do you have the side suite? besides this, besides what you're doing with Fuji?
00:30:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That's it.
00:30:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. What is your interest in July medical?
00:31:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I work with them. like them. think he's a good person, but that's really it.
00:31:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean. So. There because it makes you happy to be there. Like working with them.
00:31:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I like them. good people.

Okay. I'm just looking at again, this is no judgment. There's just like trying to figure out. So back to the business is ran by the person. What motivates you? does your time go? Like we haven't talked about time in a long time. We haven't really just, you know, kind of. um, broken down, like you, what you're doing specifically versus just sweet law. And if your time is going to other places, if your priority is elsewhere, or, um, one of the things that I like to look at is where can one action benefit multiple things, um, so just kind of trying to take everything to account. So how much time do you feel like you spend on July medical?
00:32:38 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Can we separate out July medical versus who do you think?
00:32:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
100% and our conversations have nothing to do with those conversations.
00:32:48 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I understand. I'm just saying there's a large difference. July medical less than 1% of my time. Okay. Like, Hey, You know, there's the issue with the client or something else would be the only thing that comes up, but it's it's super rare. So it's not often Fuji I talked to I don't know four or five times a week Yeah, we just talk about everything I know he's had some business ideas for I stuff once my body like with record stuff Things in general. So, you know, I definitely spend A couple hours and we just talk to him, but I don't really think of that as business per se Yeah, that just sounds like friendship.
00:33:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay, okay Sweet lot how much time do you think you spend working on that?
00:33:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
We haven't done any time tracking or So I spent a lot of time thinking about the business A lot Things are going in problems, efficiencies, in efficiencies, in efficiencies, and efficiencies, know, partnerships do we need? What are we lacking? What are we doing well? can we push? lot of time, obviously, on the financial side of what's our cost requisition, what's our end outcome, where are these numbers looking and that type of thing. But I would say it's been the vast majority of my week, you know, we're just working on one. You know, I say vastly, I would say 65 or 70 percent of my, like, weeking, getting a stinking out of it.
00:34:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
On a scale of one to ten, you think about, because I kind of want to rank two different things. And I probably could formulate these better over time, but I'm trying to make a distinction between values. So, what I'm what I'm digging for is how much kind of joy and fulfillment and just value you feel like you get out of the business versus and separate from the level of success that you think that it has. Do you understand a little bit? It's not really and clear that I'm a little bit.
00:36:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, try to put it this way. Starting this, I never had an expectation of being in this position, so I am incredibly grateful and thankful for where I am. The other part of me constantly wants to push the envelope for better force. And so that is always my struggle because there's part of the tail wagging the dog, trying to grow, but we've got to catch up to where our growth's going to be. But at the same time, the question always comes up, okay, so what is the plan? What is next? Where are you trying to get to? I rarely ever have an answer. Sure to remind, I certainly can belong to my doing this. Okay, this business gives me the best chance to make the most amount of money. I don't know what else we'll do. That would give you the same opportunity. I see the cases as a piggy bank for lack of a better term. They're there. They're worth a lot. And so, you know, that's there. I have a lot more flexibility than when it first had when I started this room. Obviously working for someone else. So, you know, I don't want to show up. I don't have to. There's nothing that I have to do. But along with that comes more responsibility, right? So, when the fan, you're the one who's responsible for it at the very, very, very end of the day. So you put in safeguard, you've been processes, but as we grow. As systems break as didn't happen that we wouldn't necessarily expect to more just quite frankly the nature of the business Didn't Mexico lawsuit barfing it's not really anyone's fault. It was just an on the other side. It just is what it is I have to get more used to it because we've had a fairly straightforward run and Or that is some Really easy going and I'm not gonna step over dollar or such trying to pick up pennies Yeah So if You just had All the money that you wanted and didn't have to work Would you work? Yes on what I don't I still think I'll be back here trying And Do the same thing that I'm doing now you know, seeing people be able to buy their houses or get married or, you know, a house to build in their lives because of this is, you know, rewarding. But sitting on a beach, sitting in a drink, it's fun for like maybe a month, but to be bored pretty quickly. But, you know, if you're like, you have all the money in the world, would I go be like a VC or something? Maybe that would be more interesting, you know, helping solve business problems. Trying to figure out how to help people with their issues and problems in a business setting to help them grow and get them where they want to get to.
00:39:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I actually think that you would love that. I don't think that you're there yet, but I think that you would serve there really well. think that it would tick all the boxes for you. and I see that as a huge potential in your future. Personally, I was asking the question. That's what I was thinking about. So that's helpful that there is no needed off-ramp that ultimately, as long as you have autonomy over your time and the place that you work, the energy, the vibe, the structure, that you're willing to pay the price of of liabilities and management and leadership, which obviously, um because you value leadership. So that's helpful when we when we take these approaches because sometimes when you um you know when you're in in the more aggressive mode then we got to do better we got to do this we got to do that whatever the the motivators behind it the drive behind it helps to keep that in perspective. So I'm like that I'm very I'm I call it bull energy because I'm like I will plow through things and get everything done and just to help with consequences but that's not really the truth like that's the energy that comes forth is that you know I'm gonna drive through no matter what but but I always have other things keeping me in check and uh it's just usually more than most people are used to because I'm intrinsically the powerfully driven and motivated, nobody and no theme slows me down, nobody and no theme can infiltrate my goals, my perspective, my values, I guess, all of those things. So, and some days I feel them stronger than others and so, you know, whoever's around is gonna feel it and that's the conversation that comes out but that doesn't mean that just because I'm like, let's go today that I that I've failed to take into account all of the other things or that I'm gonna be, you know, mad and just want to count them all everything because we don't go as fast as I want it to and that's the thing that I've picked up about you but I'm just trying to make sure that I Understand that because I feel like I understand it way better now than in the beginning in the beginning it felt Potentially potentially not necessarily incongruent but opposing values and Now that I understand you better. I think that it's more of energy that ebbs and flows and Because of that sometimes it feels more present than others and things like that. So and and all of this affects pace and In terms of how much to push certain types of things because we can push things But sometimes at at detriment to the business. So For example, we went really really hard on these inventors and and we got a whole bunch of cases and then for a while the team was really stressed and overwhelmed but then that kind of seemed to have balanced out a little bit. You know what though, one thing I would like to look at although I know it's not very high is we're just wondering what the sub-out rate was and I wish that we could have a finger on the pulse of just overall job satisfaction like maybe even monthly that we could kind of watch as the lead volume increases and we get closer to capacity anyway I gotta figure out how to because we have the Lidify dashboard for some things but some of the things that we talk about and try to track aren't things that are in Lidify like that like the MPS scores like the the overall feedback which we've only gotten what your end financial slash time goals are. What I would want to do potentially once a month or figure out some way because at least probably, I mean anywhere from 30 to 50 percent of our calls are not damn related. So I don't know how we would segment it but and this is up to you and you get to choose what your priority is and what you feel like is most valuable to you but what I would like to do is spend a little bit more time on the overall approach for what you're doing with business. How like for Dan, he's got two main focuses and probably because money has not ever been an issue. His CPA exam, another 71 has always been since I've worked with him so profitable. that there's never been a, um, that this really not a focus of the conversation. It's more like, that's a whale, whale machine.
00:47:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
How do we just keep that going?
00:47:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But the other conversations have been really important. And that is, he wants to do cool things with cool people and he needs to be solving puzzles. So like, he may want to retire, but if he did, his puzzles would be music, making music. And so that would be his thing. And so everything that we do in terms of the other aspects of the business that we look like, we'll look at kind of run through that filter of what keeps him happy so that him. Because when he's happy as everything else works well and is more efficient, then he's better at leading and the cool things with cool people means that not cool people and not cool things have to get. out and there was a lot of that that had to be done. were lot of things that really didn't match his values and what he wanted. So anyway, but for you, dogs being so important, so special to you, and knowing that being human beings in life that more hard things will come up, being able to be intentional, organized, structured, strategic around that type of goal and just kind of lending some help to that if you're interested in it. I would like to do that because I feel like the natural consequence of that is sweet law is going to be better for it.
00:48:48 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I hear so much you're saying. You do, I'm sorry, would you say?
00:48:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do. Okay, because I think it'd be happier, but the natural consequence of that is more creativity. There's scientific studies that oxytocin boosts creativity, boosts productivity, but the creativity part is really important because to me, your success in sweet life is about innovation. It's that you do things differently. You've always done it differently from the time it took over. And so if getting to spend time purposely, intentionally, consistently, weekly towards this passion project that also has the ability to be profitable, that also has the ability to potentially get you in position where you could be a venture capitalist and maybe an angel investor or maybe a startup counselor. consultant in maybe having an incubator company. I think that, I just think that creates almost kind of like a moat. Well, so we talked about the financial moat around your business. I think this is like an energy moat around the visionary, around you. Okay. So, um, and I know we're getting short on time, but this is what, okay, so let me just thinking about time. I still want to know what the heck Mary's husband is doing, because just keeps going. It's awesome.
00:50:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, well, you've been going and we're growing it slowly but surely, and I don't mind putting more money. into it if you keep getting the same type of results, right?
00:51:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so also though, let me look at my calendar, because I would like to spend a little bit of time talking to you and why I say a little bit, it's probably at least 30 minutes to an hour about what I'm learning from Patrick and Lauren's. And then is that my smoke alarm? I really hope not. I've been battling those things, changed all of their batteries, reset them all. Yes. But I'm on a call. It's been oh my gosh, unplug them all. don't care. I'll call somebody. Yeah, it will not rip. But yeah. Yes please thank you. Okay so anyway that's something in my eye. So one of the things that I okay so so the unique thing about your business is that you don't have to be in the office and you're hardly around. That sounds wrong but anyway I don't know how much oversight there is and that that's unique to your business for me and I don't know how much of a limitation that is. It's okay so anyway that just means a customized approach to how you do the business because your value is that autonomy and being able to do what you want to with your time and and then creating the best business that you can within within within within those prime which then leads us back to the multiplier concept, which is create better leaders inside of Sweet Loss, so that you don't have to be, and so you don't have to be there, and they're just doing their jobs well, and you're basically just kind of the overseer and almost a consultant to these mini businesses inside of your business. That's kind of how I think matches in aligned with the things that you've told me about what you value. So then if I get to talk with these two business owners, one of them being new, almost like mini franchises inside because they have different offices, different teams, pods, things like that, just figuring out how you can do that, figuring out a system. that supports you not having to be there a lot and continual growth and improvement. So, what does that look like in terms of meetings with them or kind of training just what we're doing? Like, I feel like they're still not really walls in an outline of what that could look like, but it feels like it's coming into view a little bit. So, but our Monday calls, we do cover a lot. So, you said, I feel like you said third.
00:54:44 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, you can't do Thursdays, right? So, I can, yeah.
00:54:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:54:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Not this Thursday, of course, but some Thursdays.
00:54:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And next week, my Thursday is full. And then we capture that.
00:55:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I Here's a, I have to suffer and go driving courses with some one between 1230 and 230.
00:55:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mark, poor Mark, I'm so sorry.
00:55:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's very difficult.
00:55:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you, now if you, um, to take a dog with you, that would even be more terrible.
00:55:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Um, I don't think the dog wouldn't like that. So you're, you're, getting thrown around the car pretty good.
00:55:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, tiny cars. Yeah. Um, okay. How is Ronan, by the way, because somebody just never sent me pictures anymore.
00:55:33 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So really. Yeah, no, I spent most of my Sunday with him. Uh, he's really into the Olympics. He loves to watch it.
00:55:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, hilarious. That is hilarious.
00:55:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
But yeah, he's, he's a big boy. He's, he's a little dog though, which is really problematic.
00:55:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are your Tuesdays?
00:55:56 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Uh, Tuesdays are usually fun.
00:55:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, how about Tuesday? at 13th. Next Tuesday.
00:56:05 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, should be fine.
00:56:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and 10, 11.
00:56:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's definitely pretty wide open. So what will three in?
00:56:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Let's make it this time. 11. I like mornings to be productive, like, use my brain, before I start talking. Speaking of using my brain, it does not want to work right now. Okay, Mark, there we go. Sweet. My. Is that for 13th? Yeah, okay. So that will work. And then, okay, so you're going to revisit Emith and rebuild the cell.
00:57:14 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I read both the cell first and then I'll revisit Emith.
00:57:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And I will as well. And then I just have, I need to formulate just kind of a structure. Now, now that I know that we can have some other discussions kind of try to create that call format so that it's productive as it can be. yeah, the goal is just, I think, I guess what I would like is for you to kind of contemplate ponder on what it would look like to be. just if you had interest in it, maybe an investor and consultant. And what do you intuitively feel like that timeline looks like for you? And if you could create this company for, do you have a name for it or anything? You're that vision? Okay. So, just maybe putting a little bit more specificity into it. Dang it, I was what that could look like is it? I mean, because I see so many potential tangents. of creating medical programs that are training for doctors who have an interest in being specialists, trained by specialists, so that somebody doesn't have to fly to Japan to get their dog, you know, help, as well as the dog food. You know, there's so many different components to it where it could be, you're somehow involved in multiple aspects of what can affect dog health from, you know, taking care of the dog with the diet, the food, but also medical, medical care, I mean, even, I don't know, I've calmed down because then my visionary brain kicks in and thinks about all kinds of things. anyway, just ponder it a little bit more. see if you can put any more specifics on to like just let yourself dream the biggest thing and not necessarily say this is not possible this is possible or probable or likely or any of those things and just what like what would you dream about if you just let yourself dream and let's talk about that and then um so yeah there's too much of my head about this right now have to like let's end right now because i gotta make the phone call okay let's do the thing from last week so let's end out okay

> 00:00:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hey, hey lady. How are you? Good. How is that onesie?
00:00:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Comfy, but I just started my period and I'm cramping and it hurts. And that is definitely what messed up my sleep. But did you know I did not know it messed up my sleep so bad until I started cracking my cycle?
00:00:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, interesting.
00:00:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's the nights that you have a sleep. Oh my gosh, like the worst. And I never really made that correlation. Like I know what my cycle is. I almost always have a 28 day cycle, although in perimenopause, I've gone like four months, a few times without it. But because I take my hormones regularly, it kind of regulated it again.
00:00:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah.
00:00:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But the two days right before, I'm like, cannot sleep at all.
00:00:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then yesterday,
00:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like my I had the raging migraine all day long and my sugar was low no matter what I ate I even ate pizza and cookie dough oh and so that was really enjoyable but then like I woke up in the middle of the night and I could feel it dropping so then I went to eat more of it but I should not have done that because I felt like garbage anyway and then my sugar totally spiked on me I'm like you know make up your mind oh my god that's funny so then I went to sleep and my daughter went to seminary because we were so we were up early but like she can manage either seminary or school and can't seem to get both done because honestly it's a lot hmm yeah and she's trying to figure out herself and I'm in the place where I was just like oh and my other daughter she's in beauty school and she was not prepared for the fact that they were chemical peels on the faces yesterday, and microdermabrasion on the back. So her body went through it. And I'm just like, okay. And then I got asked out by this crusty old nasty man today, he texted. But like he tried ask me out a few years ago, I'm pretty sure he's old enough to be my dad.
00:02:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I'm talking just crusty.
00:02:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
people's faces are cool. Okay, that was actually called gag reflex just now. I was not being sorry, dramatic. I just ate. And the thought of it is making me really, truly nervous. yeah, so he thought he would invite me to a church singles dinner. And I'm just like, I normally want to watch my mouth. But today I want to tell everybody to off.
00:02:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry.
00:02:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got you. I am very excited and happy to talk to you again.
00:02:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, that's funny. God. what an experience for your holy cow. It's Interesting though that you're tracking your sleep cycles and you found it on the day of your period because it's like this morning I started watching YouTube video from a new person. I'm gonna start following She was on a hay house meditation because I couldn't sleep last night. So I started listening to it and she wrote the Book she's a doctor and but she writes about menopause as well and intermittent fasting and she's got a book She just released called Fast like a girl or something like and and then another one's about menopause for woman but anyway, the thing that she said was interesting is She she has a good YouTube video is about Phases you're in whether it's perimenopause whether it's menopause or post-menopause and the kind of Fasting or diet structure. That's good to follow. I found interesting. Anyways, I'm a little If you ever heard of her, I'll send you the link if you're interested. Yeah, my probably followers are already. I've learned so much. Okay, let me see. I'll send it to my friend, I'm not Amanda. I'm Amanda Chavon. My friend Chavon. My man in a group text. me just get this. There you go. Hold on. It's Dr. Mindy Hells. Yes. Oh, you know where? Okay. Okay, got it. And then it's so funny because when I was googling her, I'm like, I can't believe people make a business model on this because how many people Google her because she's big now. On Etsy, there are a ton of for like $2.99 or maybe $5.10, $18.
00:04:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All of these planners for fasting using Indeed Peltz's protocol. Yeah, I mean, this is the thing because somebody was posting. Like, are we really in a recession? Like, is there really money problems? And I said. But here's the issue, there's plenty of money out there to be had by people who are creative and willing to be of service and to fill a need. But the other thing is that people who are doing that are also taking care of the people who don't know how to do that, who don't emotionally have it in them, who don't have resources or the capability for some reason, totally sorry I'm just like tangent, but like the gas prices, the groceries, the rent, all these other things, those things truly have increased 33 to 50% or more. Some of it has been like 400% looking at the grocery prices, it's closer to 400%. So people that are any kind of connected to their community are definitely filling the pain at the end. economy. But, you know, the perspective is, is that this, there is, did you ever see the movie robots with Will, Will Smith? No, yeah, I was Will Smith and that Robin Williams was in it.
00:06:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I'm sure I've seen it. Let me see, there's maybe Will Smith was the eye robot. Yeah, Okay, the cartoon one.
00:06:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, did you ever see it?
00:06:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know.
00:06:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Maybe not. Um, Robin Williams, it's a great cast. Jennifer Coolidge, Mel Brooks, William McGregor. It's amazing. Um, but, um, it was about this, uh, you know, awkward robot who didn't fit in, but he made his way in the world and he was a fan of this inventor who ended up being, you know, a jerk. But his thing was always see a need, feel a need. And that's how you make a arc and that's how you change the world and anyway so yes we really and truly are in a recession and but the reason people can't figure it out is because there is tons of money still being spent in a market but the the money has shifted but yeah oh you don't need all of it you just need enough and these people are like there's another quote that i love is um don't get in the way away if you think something's impossible get out of the way of people who are doing it or something like that love that yeah anyway so and all of this is in perfect alignment with what you're doing because i'll say we are doing yeah um because youtube is a way for everybody to get a piece of it and the whole you know what i came across and shared with you last week is that less than two percent or around two percent of youtube on YouTubers are actual content creators, that's wild.
00:08:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, anyway, well, no, and it was cool on the the teaching, like everyone loved it, and I'm doing a repeat of it on tomorrow as well. Oh, I should actually send an email out to remind people. Um, but, you know, it's just, it's so interesting that, um, people are looking for alternative things right now too, at the same time. Like, I don't know, maybe you do, but I hear from my other friends that people who used to sell a ton of switching tangent a little bit, who used to sell a lot of money on high ticket coaching, now trying to figure out what to do, right, because the sales aren't coming in. so now obviously they're looking at AC phones too, but, um, I think the YouTube thing, uh, is a no risk solution because it's free. Did I tell you? So my sister didn't even know that it was free to post a video on YouTube and start a channel.
00:09:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:09:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I said, Oh, my God, Julia, I need to get you on a Zoom call and record you. And I post the video up because you're asking questions I never even thought people would have. I just assumed people, you know, so yeah, she's like, Oh, wow, that actually really is cool to launch a business that way, right? one of the guys on the YouTube course on Saturday, yeah, I also said that, um, yeah, we were always taught to monetize it by getting the subscribers and the views and then ads, but I love segueing to digital offers. So so and that's before I didn't tell anyone about the name change that we're going to do. I kept it to keep congruent with what they bought. I kept it as YouTube fast track naming convention, you know, I think I changed the slide deck to just say YouTube profits so that we didn't have to do too much re tooling later. Oh, yeah. Mm hmm.
00:10:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have my heating pad on too, just so you know Buffalo Plaid onesie so you can visualize this. I got up and took my daughter to oh my gosh I keep forgetting I got to meet with my attorney clients at one o'clock too. They're awesome I'm just like want to be in bed today not really but like physically. I was like that yesterday I actually from one o'clock on I just stopped working I but mine was different I had that hot chocolate hangover oh yeah yeah I finally feel amazed today but I'm getting back into intermittent fasting and I do feel better today like it's two o'clock I have energy so that's a good good thing yeah let's see Within two weeks, you just highlight all this. Here's the entire recording, um, but this is not downloadable, right?
00:11:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, it is actually.
00:11:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Let me go there so I can download it. don't want to. Do you happen to have to zoom have a transcript for you? Because that would be what's most helpful to me.
00:11:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, what I can do is upload it to unlisted YouTube channel and it produces the transcript.
00:11:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get that. Would you please because I want to, um, go through and make the first version of an outline that you can go through. Oh, yeah, I covered all this. I bet you'll probably even surprise yourself by how maybe not because I know you studied any prepared everything. But with the questions that people asked you. Yeah. then everything that you covered. And then what we could do is look at did and um oh I don't know how good my brain is going to do right now sorry I was thinking about using Maui to create some you know graphically pleasing things that you're not spending time doing that and I could pay for that and and work with him and follow some instructions I was thinking um that you know lots of people make the make youtube products use youtube colors or they use their branding colors and I think a blend of because we know that blue is trust a deep dark a deep dark blue that goes good with the youtube red and um nice oh I like that I do let me see if I can find a hex color yeah the reason I chose the reds and the sales page because I remember watching another guy I don't know know is no heard of his name's Korosh I forget his last name he's kind of like a uh a secret allen sultanic like he's behind the scenes of a lot
00:13:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
low ticket funnels as well. And I'm in his community because I paid $27 for his low ticket offer. He was reviewing someone's offer about YouTube. And I remember he gave the guy , he said, okay, you got to, the copy's not bad, but you know, you have to have red in here because this is YouTube course you're selling and people are familiar with YouTube and use the red. So that's where I got that little tip because normally I don't use red in my sales pages.
00:13:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So dark blue gradient. I see that's a little darker than I want.
00:13:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So we're going to be like Superman colors than I was thinking. Oh yeah, I love that. Me too. I actually have a Superman t-shirt.
00:13:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love it. So Marvel or DC? I'm a Superman's DC, but are you more Marvel or DC?
00:13:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, I don't know the difference.
00:13:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just like the movies. What? Yeah, I assume all of those are Marvel, but Superman is easy Batman and DC Now, you know nerdy I am That's cool.
00:14:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think I watched really cool I think what I mean about a TED talk how Marvel licensed a lot of these brands and it was yeah, it was a cool business kind of TED talk.
00:14:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Oh, yeah for sure so I think something not quite as dark as this, but I was hoping that if I picked one it would give me more Ooh like this something like that Um, so with the youtube red like that will just compliment really well.
00:14:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let's see You know, you literally could just grab the hexacode from the Superman logo I don't know you wanted to go that brighter blue.
00:14:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I don't I well So I think about I strain when I okay And certain colors are easier on the eyes.
00:15:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
God, okay. Okay.
00:15:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, anyway, but I think something, something like that, and it almost feels kind of Superman esque. And you could put, let's if there's like a YouTube logo here, design elements.
00:15:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And obviously, obviously a yellow will go with a nice fat too.
00:15:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Let's see. Elements back. I mean, they just look good together, that looks powerful to me.
00:15:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:15:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
looks really good, actually. I like that's pretty cool. That's got a nice and well, there's darker versions.
00:15:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I wonder what the darker version What's funny is check out, I'm going to put it in the zoom chat. I just googled like color combinations for red and blue. And this particular pin on Pinterest is kind of identical to the colors you got on there just for just for yachts. Go ahead and click that link in the zoom chat.
00:16:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's hilarious, Maria. Yes. Are we not in sync? I love that. I love that. Oh, I like this. The colors are not quite the same, so we can edit to match.
00:16:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, I'm just going to grab my tea.
00:16:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK.
00:16:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
My tea.
00:16:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My green tea. tea. Mm, text. OK. Alrighty. I don't know. I am not a designer, but just just a little like idea. Something to start with. He's really great at stuff, but I like hobby. beginning of like let's use these kinds of colors um yeah i don't know but i mean i think it looks sharp i mean i will look that and go you or anything like that yeah no no i i love it i think it looks fantastic yeah yeah um just for the heck of do you want me to find that youtube sales page or that other guy for sure okay let me see let's we can use this as um just kind of gathering resources and then making a gangpline because you still have one call on deck for gaining information and then um but i would love to mass assimilate everything and if we're um you know we we weren't kind of opposite schedules but we don't need to be in meetings to be productive our rocks or chats are really productive i do screen captures i'm sure you do screen captures so like if we want to be aggressive about setting a deadline and putting something together like you can see i'm i'm willing to like we can create things together i can put things into membership areas like we can really roll this out quickly.
00:19:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. And I figured it'd be like go high level membership area because I know sistine.io has membership area but for like scaling it.
00:19:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes and um worst key scenario like one of them worst case scenario but like damn um he would be helpful especially if you threw him a bum by not charging him so much or something. Yeah sure yeah but like he's got his team is like really good at it and fast and they know lots of things they could help us with the chat bot um so there's a lot that we could do and however that works out like uh I could help you with whatever you're doing with him like I don't want to uneven the burden but in terms of like getting something done quickly, efficiently, expertly. Yeah we've got some some resources to go to. My girl has um been kind of quiet. she's a young mom with young kids and trying to figure out babysitting stuff lately.
00:20:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:20:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, anyway, so I think that that could be a good place to start and build a home kind of quickly. I say easily because we've got people and if people need to be paid, I'm willing to put money out to pay for it. However, you know what I mean? Like I am in whatever this takes because I know that you're going to bring amazing content.
00:20:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, it's hurting. Well, yeah, and what it'll be cool is like, here's what the Nirvana that I'm looking forward to. was going to say it because I know this is what you also will be good at. I'm sure and want to be in control of is like just all of the keeping to the plan, like the big rocks and
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and future plan and having like financial meetings like you'll go okay like whether you hire a VA or someone to actually monitor you know the the money's coming in and money's going out for this and then um just I just think that would be really cool to have like CFO dashboard type meetings once a week or something or maybe it's in our like yeah so so yeah uh shoots so we can start I always start rudimentary we'll call it um you know we'll just do that and so we can track um so expense description I'm um source paid Um, so like if it's Tina's account or Maria's account, whatever, yeah, then revenue. Um, we'll, we'll track, um, resource, date, received, um, um, paid to Maria, yeah, I'm out, paid to Tina, out, we'll just, this is rudimentary too.
00:22:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I don't know, I get it, yeah.
00:22:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow, and then oh, actually we'll go paid to Maria. Cause I have no idea how we're going to do it and organize, but I think that you were talking about like doing it US for reasons and so, yeah, you know, like because so many things are changing like now, even when I use, um, Upwork, they want to,
00:23:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
and Fiverr. They want to charge me GST. So if I hire someone for like 10 bucks to do an e-book cover, then all of sudden they're charging 13% on it. So when I pay the person their 10 bucks, I'm also paying the extra $1.30. And that'll add up over time, which is ridiculous because me, I don't know how they're doing it because it's against tax law because the only time you pay GST is if the service provider lives in Canada as well. So if someone lives in Pakistan, I'm still paying this goods and services tax and harmonized tax. It's like, whoa, so yeah, we would lose out so much if we had to do through my Canadian company, all the members, like all the revenues in, all the expenses. I'd rather have your US entity have all the revenues in expenses and all that jazz.
00:23:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, we will, we will, we can plan on that and then figure out how to, you know, because we're not great, but that definitely sounds like we're probably better than, than doing it that way. So, um, Yeah, okay, so we will, so let me share this with you.-hmm. Sure. Yeah. Um, what, it's self-explanatory. Sure, anyway. You know, nobody can't, okay. Um, oh, what was the YouTube sales page?
00:24:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, uh, yeah, I just set that to you in the Zoom chat.
00:24:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:24:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, there it is.
00:24:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was a nice time. It was a nice say it. Oh.
00:24:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Now his givers are high because he's a YouTube agency as well. That created a little ticket. So all of those testimonials are his one-on-one agency client. So I thought that was a little not cool, but it is what it is, I guess.
00:24:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yeah. So what is it about this that you do like and that you want to model?
00:24:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
what, oh, no, no, no, nothing to model off. It was just, it was just, that was the funnel. The guy was critiquing because he had an old. for colors. And then and Kurosh was like, okay, you're selling YouTube and you got to make these colors red and white and black.
00:25:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, got you.
00:25:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's all. That was just the point. Like, I have no idea how well it converts. I'm sure it's good. But obviously he's got a good back end because he does like high ticket AMC YouTube work for people. So yeah.
00:25:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:25:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But I mean, it's not much of a product. He's just giving out 100 done for your video. He's actually bought it. It's just a freaking like, of course, he has some videos about it, which is good. But it literally is just like beginnings, like the hooks for a video. It's ridiculous.
00:25:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I wonder what kind of YouTube PLR we could get to value stack.
00:25:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, I already bought one on Etsy. And if you pull in that Canva template that I gave to resell rights, the YouTube ultimate, the ultimate YouTube planner. And it was Pretty decent, actually.
00:26:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, what kind of did you give me?
00:26:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, yeah, I think I also sent you like in that email that I gave you a copy of. There's a link to the slide deck. Actually, I'm sorry.
00:26:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't like give you the Canva template on Friday and it's in the Trello board Friday night.
00:26:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, if you just click the Google Drive link, I can show you where the links are to the presentation as well, whichever is easiest.
00:26:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, well, let me get two profits for you and change this.
00:26:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, I don't know if I put it in that board, so I think I might put it in the list of YouTube profits under HQ, Business HQ, I think.
00:26:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, because that's where we decided we were going to do things. Yeah, so, um, there you go, draft presentations. Yeah. Yeah, I have bad the windows that you probably can't see that are in the way I got to move. Oh, OK. Out of the way in the chat, uh, sorry. Where am I going?
00:26:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Under YouTube profits for offer. Let's do the second one draft presentation. Oh, okay. I moved it up higher.
00:27:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you could see it higher Dang it open. I just want to open you.
00:27:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Thank you. There you go. Okay, cool Oh, look at this Yes Well, maybe I can See that way and if you go to page 12 Oh, I quoted you on the on the video on page 10 Uh, and then when I'm talking I say and this was from my friend Tina Marie that said this so good Do you want to live on youtube or do you want to live? I mean there now everything else I've made the don't be temple bundle research and google worship But the ultimate youtube planner camera template that's from master resale rights. It's actually pretty darn good I just changed the the the beginning of it um Yeah I just changed the cover page see how it's got pictured me there Gleeing against the graffiti wall.
00:27:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes Oh, I see.
00:28:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. I mean, it's pretty decent.
00:28:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And we could just change the branding like the style and the layout or did you already do that?
00:28:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, all I did is change the cover to put a picture of me in the background. I didn't really didn't teach by it. I said, look, if you're the type of person that needs a planner, here's this because the Google Google sheet is really the planner and the implementation thing, you know?
00:28:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Just the tiniest bit of like making everything white instead of cream and like maybe changing the font and apply all so that it looks slightly different. I agree. it doesn't look at an immediate man thing.
00:28:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I literally downloaded it Friday at 11 p.m.
00:28:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
with before this. Oh, yeah. No, I'm not saying you should have done it already. I was just saying we do this and I'd be happy to do it and all that. And you did so much.
00:28:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah, I was up to a minute on Friday preparing it.
00:28:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You are, you our rock star workhorse. It's so good.
00:29:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
The real man is for you to be making the money and like it not be for your clients or a husband or whatever. feel good that way and then Tina and honestly made me think because there's two other people that remember there was a few people pipeline. There's two other people still pretty serious about wanting to hire me and it makes me think like just to stick with this and this only you know and not even entertain. I'm just telling them hey look I'm fully booked till January February something. don't know but just because listen this pulled in I envisioned 30 sales I said 30 spots do you know that because remember when I talked there was 20 spots like 2k I think at five minutes to 12 before it closed and redirected to hey it's closed URL the 30th sale came in and I was and I was visioning 30 spots.
00:30:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ah, girl, that manifestor in you.
00:30:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes. Yeah. So I thought that was cool. Now I reopened it just today to close to work since I'm teaching again live tomorrow. So I'm just going to send a quick email to my list in case any stragglers because I've had a few messages. Hey, can I still get in? But yeah, anyways, just some thoughts about that.
00:30:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You've got the one guy at $5,000 every month and you said that covers your lights on costs, right?
00:30:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It really does. Like I do pay Sally some money out of it. Like I paid her 500 a few days ago to work on like the crap stuff that I like to do, like the formatting inside the funnel and his go-high level account and like putting together some.
00:30:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, go ahead. All right. Before I lose my train of thought because my pain, I lose my focus or easy. Yeah. One second. almost did it. Oh, so in terms of like now, this wouldn't be as much money. But first of all, right now, like your needs. are close to met, especially with the extra little bit of income, but would it not be more joyful for you even if you just did another let's say four more live webinars through the end of the year and sold that or we just like hustled out and knocked this out and made another two, five to 10k, who knows? the potential for 10k is pretty easy if we really work quick and but I think this would be so much more joyful. I don't to settle for anybody else's stuff. I think that this is a prime time for launching a product like this.
00:31:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And what did you sell up for? Oh, just I just said it's 97. It's normally two 97 early bird price. And I said, Hey, this also probably become a $1,000 course because I'm adding to right?
00:31:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think what if you kept selling it at 97 the end of the year. And on January, let's say fifth, right? So that people have time to get through the holidays and make a last minute decision. It's 97. But at that point, it goes to 147. And we don't tell them, we just tell them the price is increasing. Period. End of story, never to be this low again. And we can let it just, you know, microscopically kind of increase to 147. But if you already got that many sales at 97, and it was kind of by the seat of your pants, granted, your pants are brilliant marketer pants.
00:32:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
they're not average pants, right?
00:32:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
but the sales page is . going to admit that.
00:32:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
The delivery and the content is amazing. Like that's where I spent all my time. there's probably 12 hours and just two hours of And I both know the ugly converts and words probably were not should be on the page. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and I did have cell the screenshot, some of the people's zoom comments and she stuck it on the sales page, this more, a few of them.
00:33:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, not average pants, that's a long thing.
00:33:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I understand, yeah. And I did tell them that I'll be coming to them within seven days with a very small survey for their feedback, make this course even better, but also in little testimonial contests where they can win a $500 reward. So someone will win like a one hour with me. But I definitely want real testimonials, not just in a zoom comment, but like someone either emails me or leaves a comment on Facebook, on my post, or they send in a video testimonial.
00:33:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So here is a, obviously I've had no time to think this through, but what if, and I don't know how your, your viewer listed, but you're getting, you're getting, how many of the people that came to it, came through you too?
00:33:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
you know? Isn't that interesting? Yeah, you know, I tried do a little poll. I'm not like I did an official poll who has a YouTube channel who doesn't and 80 percent of people have a YouTube channel who came um but um I would say uh probably out of the 30 people I would say 10 I was really surprised that they came from YouTube first joined school I will say that so then the school could be at five bucks a month uh and then school and I didn't really again I would say a one out of ten effort um I just posted a couple of posts to join the YouTube class um and that's really it so so I think even more could have came from it so that might be an interesting funnel YouTube videos to a school low low price you know five bucks a month thing to that your other digital offer
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that could be something interesting, play it at work as well.
00:35:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Which, when you think about it, is what I think Hermosi is really teaching on school.
00:35:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could not care less about that guy, so I never even think about it. Oh, I know, I know, know. Funnel idea. And that might be wrong because maybe the better funnel idea is we stick with what we're talking about. We send them to a low ticket offer or a webinar. No, because it's already worked. Yeah, it does. Thank you. you. You, you, you, in less than two weeks of having this idea specifically, and this offer, as far as I know, you've only had this particular offer for teaching YouTube profits that you've been talking about for just two weeks. And that's correct.
00:35:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Two weeks. That's correct.
00:35:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you, you, for sure, there was Facebook traffic and there was YouTube traffic. And I think you need to banish the low ticket in terms of like less than $97. I don't think we have to go there. I think we want to go there later to spend it, but right now. how if we want to maximize eyeballs and profitability and also energy and the fact that you got 30 people to say yes at 97 in two weeks they have to warm up to the idea that's pretty powerful those are powerful signals so let's mimic what you already did so it's YouTube and Facebook to school to sales page to live webinar or ESL or other webinar drop it and turn into that what what
00:37:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes, what what what this for yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, we we could really capture the whole craziness about school right now. Um, know, there's so many people that are intrigued about school because of Alex Hermosi and I have to say it was easy.
00:37:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like even getting stuff up on system IO, there's still always pain in the butt, whereas I have to say for a lot of people delivering knowledge and coaching on school is probably one of the simplest software plays ever.
00:37:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Why instead of getting more complicated right now, why don't we just do the YouTube class and course on school?
00:37:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because you can unlock that like that can be its own paid thing. Hold on, let's go into school. Yep. Yeah, right now I a Black Friday toolkit that is locked.
00:38:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, everybody's already there.
00:38:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, I should because you put me as a admin.
00:38:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I did. You are an admin in mine. What if I change it to business accelerator? But I kept the make money with Maria online there for now because what you and I need to talk about is if we're going to probably start a new YouTube channel around this new brand of ours, I could record the setting up of that channel as part of the training material too.
00:38:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, why can't I? I should see it and make money online with Maria's doll. Yeah, okay, so classroom. Yeah, so the YouTube thing could be in here or we could create a whole new one for an extra $100 a month when that's one of the customers out of 30 you already sold. So like we can make that investment and it be worthwhile and and so and they'll see it and you can link to it Here if we have any other courses we can link to that. Why don't we just stick with school my Sorry, man my my brain just goes in and out when I get a rush of pain and heat Okay Got to catch my breath for a second Um So I like speed of implementation and I like minimum viability for new products. Yeah long term I would like to build out a robust system that does really good Nurturing and that's what I think high level is great for. Yeah, I have to take time here. I'm sorry. Hold on My body is going through it. Okay, um, do you just can come and just resurrect me right now.
00:39:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'll be okay with that Okay
00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, with that, Jeez. Come on. So, yeah, so minimal invincibility, it is an extra expense, it's, I mean, a go-high level is $300 a month anyway at an agency level. you know, we could put that at, like, 2, 2025, where, okay, now we've got a community, now we've got people, and we could just start, instead of migrating people over, we can offer them, say, hey, we're migrating, but basically, live in both areas until everybody dies off here, or we moved over and can incentivize them to move over, because you get lost when you try to move people to new building, right? already got subscriptions going, and that's not good. Yeah. So, anyway, we could do that, but in the meantime, this allows us to teach them quickly into fulfill what's been sold and to nurture them, and then high level would be part of the larger master Sound which is first of all kind of automating the teaching experience with the follow-up Hey, did you check out this you know module one? I noticed you didn't check it out. Here's what you should what you can do for blah blah blah which takes a lot of time to write that kind of Engagement nurturing sequence, but we'll get more people to consume the content More people to get results and really help us to make a bigger impact which also then creates more brand awareness We'll sort of mouth all that but in addition to it then we can start working on expanding the You know the marketing and the business growth and upgrading right so higher value higher price and But also now where you can you will have money that we will have earned from here like like let's set a goal hold on so if we're talking about the beginning of q2 in 2025 that we've made 80,000 through this by then. So 40,000 for you, 40,000 for me, but let's say we set aside 10,000 for each. So maybe like we set aside 20% for business growth includes marketing systems teams forever. And then we just put that in a kitty. And it's, it's, you know, but high visibility, you see it, I see it, we both can see it. you know, you know, we know exactly where the money is at, at all times. And we have weekly updates on finances and total transparency. And not because either of us have any concern, but because that's just a practice. don't allow apathy, we don't allow any kind of temptation or anything to create that. I'm not worried about it, but the thing this, as soon as you stop worrying about stuff like that, you know, the adversary is good at what he does.
00:42:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And he can, he can twist people.
00:42:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we just want to make sure that we avoid that opportunity and have total transparency on a weekly basis. Anyway, so you set aside. 8%. I think there's, for sure, I think we could do $80,000 by then. But even if we did half of that by then and have the whatever other income coming in and manage the resource as well, move it to high level, launch the bigger thing. We've got a following, we've got people who should automatically upgrade, even if it's 10% and even if it's 10% of let's say like 300 people and not, I think that that's conservative. Based off of the 30 you got into weeks.
00:43:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:43:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, let's just kind of write it down as like a. Let's see. So, would we start from scratch, a new school community, or what do you think? I think you do because then you get it branded. And you can really use branding power, give it a very specific name so that people who are curious. Let's just about and then they watch the sale. video that can be right there on that page.
00:44:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. And and and I think it's good too, because then we can keep it specific to the like people search now in school for stuff. And obviously, if they searched anything to do with YouTube, they wouldn't find me.
00:44:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But one guy did say he's sorry. I said right.
00:44:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. But one guy for the make money from me online, he did search digital offers, and that's how he found me. That's how he joined. So I thought that was cool to hear as well.
00:44:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. So my brain is going by myself. I'm just going to this is going to be all over place. Q two.
00:44:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's okay.
00:44:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Level. Whoa. Okay. Now. Okay. Hold on a second. Oh, yeah. That's how this works. So let's see. Road map. Whatever. It's different than that, but we'll see that. So Q4, new school group dedicated to 97 a month, YouTube, of course, price, goes back in January. What's the what's the first Monday after the first week of January? January 6th, or was I at trouble? This is it? January 6th, 2025 and we'll One, four, seven. Okay. Huge. Huge.
00:46:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And.
00:47:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, this is kind of capturing what we were talking about. So, we're talking EK by March, 20,% in growth accounts for those units. So, that's it. etc. Okay, so that captures what we're doing. So now, in the meantime, what what we need is to figure out what can we do and like what are you willing to do? What do you want to do? don't know how exhausting was to do that that life call. Do you want to do another one and do it like in two weeks from now so you have some more time to build it up and we just like build out a marketing campaign and devote some money to those, whether it be YouTube ads or just...
00:48:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I think we could because I still think 97 is a good price point to cool traffic. Yeah, and we just have to... Yeah, I mean, we'd have more testimonials too on sales patient. Pretty powerful. And literally, we have no upsells or downsells or order bumps so can imagine how much money... We could make. Um, yeah, I'm game for that.
00:49:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's plan that out too. Okay, so, um, um, um, plan. We'll let be another live webinar in two weeks. So, um, so do you want to do it two weeks from last Saturday?
00:49:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, yeah, we can do that.
00:49:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
we'll just check in this enough time. Oh, I mean, you did that crazy fast.
00:49:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, yeah, no, teaching is not a problem. It's more the ads for in the sales page. Because my thought processes, do we keep it in Sistine.io or do we move that to your high level account?
00:49:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, so what I think we do is keep the same thing while we're building out the back end and delivering the content, sell it the same way you sold it. So, we're not over complicating anything while putting out the long term strategy, but that allows us to just. been to making money now and kind of just refining the process.
00:50:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Got it. Okay.
00:50:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, so that was, that would be November 16th. And man, I'm kidding. Yeah.
00:50:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry, my brain just checks out. No, no, no. Um, and we can talk more about tomorrow because when I do paid traffic, I like, I'll cry if we don't have an old bump or an upsell.
00:50:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So let's, let's just kind of think about that real quick. And I think that, um, you could have that be, um, you know, it, maybe it is just an upgrade of another $100 a month, but then they get access to a higher level group and you'll answer personal questions, like we don't have to overcomplicate it, it could be critiquing, it could be like, you know, what are the typical upsells that? Oh, go ahead.
00:51:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I misunderstood. Um, I never liked selling anything recurring on a funnel, that type of traffic. So, well, except the $5 a month was a no-brainer for the school community, but so I was thinking that the current system, Iowa, um, pages for $97 one shot. So, so that one would have the order bump and the upsell because school doesn't allow order bumps.
00:51:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So what I'm saying is what, what could be offered as an order bump so that we're maximizing on that.
00:51:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, yeah, um, I gave away so much, unfortunately, in the original thing. So, um, and if we're gonna keep it at 97, I don't think I'd want to take anything away. So the natural thing for especially an upsell is anything that accelerates that. Um, so, Well, usually it's templates, but I really kind of give away the templates they need. I can't I think I need to think about it.
00:52:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, Yeah.
00:52:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, I mean, one thing I think that would be cool for them to have, but I don't want to deliver it is like once a week working sessions, like, you know, how you show me that one time for ADHD owners, but I don't want to deliver on that. don't want to, as an empath, that just kill me.
00:52:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I go through your templates and figure out what is still a good stack, but what can you separate? So that it doesn't have to be a big upsell and and also remember, you know, we're testing. This is what testing. So if we find that person's drop because you took something away, yeah, then, you know, we revamp it and we we learn. Um, but if if go ahead, I know a really good upsell.
00:52:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If we took out, because I don't know why much that sold on the sales page because I didn't really make it clear or talk about it a lot, but what would make a good upsell is something called the automated YouTube growth stack and it's us teaching them how to hire a VA, how to manage them. Here's the scripts. Yeah, like here's the SOP you give them, like the stuff that I was going to do in scribe anyway. That would be an amazing upsell one.
00:53:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Higher VA scripts you give them. Remind me something else.
00:53:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, a standard of frame seizures so that they literally can just give them, hey, here's the research and planning SOP. Go plan out four videos for me, you know, for this month. Here's the how to upload a YouTube video SOP, you know, go do this for me. Like it'd be systemized by the process.
00:53:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What about this also?
00:54:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes, yes. Yeah.
00:54:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, so you and I, like, you know, yeah, we could do that. We could knock that out pretty quickly and we could get it done in two weeks. Yep. Um, I'm the kind of person who will stay up all night in the middle of the night to meet a deadline. And, um, I would rather not do that, I 100% with, like, I'm, I won't promise something and not fulfill it. So, um, I can't.
00:54:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know, that's how I work.
00:54:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, that's how this YouTube thing got done.
00:54:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If I didn't have pre sales of it, it would still be.
00:54:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I should do this course. I know, but I want you to know that that's who I am too, because it hasn't yet yet. And, um, because we're talking about an aggressive timeline. And I know that you know that there are a lot of people be like, this is cool. Let's do this. And then crickets. Um, yeah, you're the one pulling the all nighter and doing that kind of stuff. So I want you to know that, like, I'm, I'm game for this. This is a sprint. And for me, you know, you kind of suffer for sprints a little bit and then you, you take break and so holidays are coming. That'll be a good break time and we will be able to coast through that off of the, the high of having served and delivered really well and we can spend, you know, a couple of weeks at the end of December, just really nurturing the group instead of creating anything or doing any webinars or anything, just spending whatever time that we are working, nurturing people, taking care of them, answering questions, letting them get to know us and the mama bears, like we are, um, and, and that can be where our personality and that part of the branding kind of comes through. And, uh, I think that that would be great. So, um, this. Yes. So. I don't want to. Oh, gosh. I got to go because I have to get ready for this call. So I think this was amazing. I don't want to laugh because it makes me cramp really bad.
00:56:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry. Okay.
00:56:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So if we meet tomorrow, even honestly, I don't even think that we have to meet tomorrow. We can just start working. Man, why am I losing my breath? my asthma is bugging me really bad right now too. So, so let's see planning. So if we figure out what has to happen to make these happen. Yeah. What, like, what would you create? So the Trello board, like, I can create something, but all needs. some stuff to plug into it so I can see like, you know, what are you thinking? then I'll be able to riff off of what you create. But right now, like, I, there's a blank canvas in my brain. And so I'll a I'll do a quick loom video for you, because honestly, just face off the checklist in the Google spreadsheet, because that is my process. So, yeah, um, at Maria, please get me a transcript. And so we can start with that also. And so that should tag you. And we are going to have more tasks come out once I get that. And once you start with the the SOPs. And then we're going to be busy. Let's see. I would love to see if, if, If we can get a good turnout for two weeks from now, I would love to do it one more time while we're thinking and maybe take that best recording and turn it into an auto webinar.
00:58:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh yeah, that'd be cool, yeah.
00:58:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or clip it and make VSL out of it or something like that. then we can script out and maybe make a better video and then talk about our own YouTube channel. But in the meantime, if we want to capitalize on making money, the fact that, you know, there's this end of the year buying, there's Black Friday, Cyber Monday, the new year, you, all these types of things, then rather than try to make it perfect right now, let's just show up, you know, two more times, which is easy for me to say because I'm not the one showing up to do the webinar, but I think that as long as you're not overwhelmed with the rest of the work, that's kind of like an area that you like doing and you've already done the research. So I build an support for you in in between those times, I think it wouldn't be too much. But let me know if I'm wrong.
00:59:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let's talk about it, you know, throughout the week, because I might. Yeah, because Sally started performing pretty good on on some of that funnel work for the other clients. So my time might be more freed up than I thought. So let's see.
00:59:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:59:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:59:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, in terms of like, would you be willing to do two for live webinars, one in two weeks and one four weeks later?
00:59:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, when you mean live webbers, you mean, itching the thing, like people.
00:59:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, what you just did.
00:59:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, absolutely.
00:59:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. if that is something you're willing to do, and we do all the rest of this stuff, I think that that the revenue will come through that vehicle without a lot of complicated stuff while we build the fulfillment mechanisms, then we can build the automated leverage sales mechanism where you don't we're not doing like. webinars. We're doing either auto webinars or VSLs or creating a separate YouTube channel that is a magnet for leads and to this funnel anyway.
01:00:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
01:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So simple and it's all because you did what you do naturally, just creating videos, doing research, discovered a system, wanted to teach it, and this blossomed out of Maria just being Maria.
01:00:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, and so the only next thing to talk about, mainly miners, how to manage my time because now that I'm doing more of this, I'm more visible, I'm getting a lot of messages in my Facebook messenger, hey, we should connect. what about this?
01:00:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
hey, I had a consult call few months ago, I'm thinking of in the most. should read that you can. So even if it's just audio voices and dumps, like these are the scenarios. These are the things that are coming up. I would like help with figuring out how to handle this. So right now I have a vague idea of what it is, but they claim I am on exactly what's happening. Okay. You know how to have some people, let's just do this, this, this, and this. We'll not available, blah, blah, blah. Yeah. And just to handle it, because you don't need to do anything other than this and take care of the one guy that you have.
01:01:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So that's what I'm thinking and also just I don't want to also ruin good karma because some of these people are potentially good people for next year if we want to have one high ticket client for quarter one on one, you know? Right.
01:01:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
then we use like, you know, I'm filled up until this time and this is what's coming on. Do you want to be at the top of the list? And if you do, it requires a deposit. And if you don't, No worries. I'm just reached out to me. if it's meant to be, it's meant to be. And I love it. And nobody gets offended by it. People do get offended by it. That automatically lets me know there were too much of a diva to work with anyway.
01:02:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And thank you very much. Yeah, yeah.
01:02:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Perfect.
01:02:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
you.
01:02:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I'm so glad that we were able to talk. I was totally looking forward to it. even though I'm in miserable pain, I got a shot of vitamin M.
01:02:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
it was good.
01:02:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yay.
01:02:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Awesome.
01:02:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I loved it.
01:02:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All right.
01:02:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Talk to you later. Have a few better. Cheers. Bye-bye.

## Quote 23

> 00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hello friends, how are you? still have sick child. Yeah, she has to go to her dad's for the weekend, so I didn't get to mama and take care of her and give her other biddies so she'd get better. How are you guys?
00:00:32 - Patrick Shahverdian
So good.
00:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:00:35 - Patrick Shahverdian
Mm hmm.
00:00:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, was new. It's good guys. Take me.
00:00:46 - Patrick Shahverdian
We're at 600 something K and settlements for the month so far.
00:00:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Put my chair. Good job. I mean, things are, you know, going as they, as they should, good, come with some more detail than that. Come on. You know how much Mark pays me to meet with you, but for today, it's a skin in the game. Let's go.
00:01:22 - Patrick Shahverdian
I mean, it's just things are going as it's supposed to be like treatment is being done, getting a lot of policy limits, so that means the clients are willing to get the treatment that they need, which requires, you know, case managers to sometimes push them to get that treatment or explaining why we want them to get that treatment, which is good. And then, you know, obviously we got one big case, but that doesn't I mean, that thing slowed down. So I made sure to tell the team, firstly, I just ignore that it even gets settled. just try to act like we don't have. So we don't rely on that big one for the month, but yeah, trying to get to a million, but I don't know if we'll go in there.
00:02:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's the 15th path. We can do it. I believe in you.
00:02:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
How are you doing, Lorenz? Pretty good. Not having as good of a month as Patrick, obviously. But I'm actually pretty excited because a lot of those big cases I've been working on for the last year are either demanded or we're drafting a demand, or they're going to be ready in the next few weeks here to demand. So I'm going to start hitting some big ones here soon. So I'm excited about that. Obviously, the extended vacations everyone is taking is requiring some organization skills. Thankfully, Mary took pity on me and sent me Karen, who is a, we just hired her, think a month ago or something, but she's an experienced case manager. spoke with her today. We're going to be using her for as long as Mary will let us have her. So she's going to be sliding in to whichever team has a missing member at an given point, but I can definitely use her.
00:03:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. So let me open. I have a setting up a meeting so We have a guy that's been helping us with Lidify reports. When I started working with Mark, every time I would ask, where do we get this? We're, I don't know, there'll be a pain in there to get, like, I don't care, do it anyway. Anyway, so we found somebody who can help get us the data that we want and organize it. And it is a pain because Lidify is not intuitive is much money as goes into that. And as many people have their business on it, you would think they would do a better job, but no. Not optimized offers, I don't think. Yeah. So, but we're, we found a guy and he does a really good job at things. But now the process of getting the reports is kind of convoluted. so I need to get on a call with him and with Mark, which we're working on scheduling. So that we can. Get all the reports that way that I want them, including one for you guys, just to go look at that. Has the data that you should be looking at. I haven't looked at this yet today because I have a second. My baby is almost 15. And my oldest is about to be 24. One of my looking for Tina to bring together. Tina girl. It's not so smart sometimes. tell me. Reports. It's free. As for it. There it is. It's because I minimized my thing. Do you manage my team? What I want? Look at some numbers. Oh, yeah. And. I think. Mark told me that all of this isn't accurate, but it was close. What am I looking at? For October, it was this month. Refresh. Yeah, because what I see for you, Patrick, yeah, this can't be right, is, well, gross attorney fees by team for you would be 65,000. That's not right, right?
00:06:36 - Patrick Shahverdian
It's like an average?
00:06:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, gross for October.
00:06:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, Mark posted higher numbers yesterday.
00:06:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so this report is definitely not correct.
00:06:51 - Patrick Shahverdian
Sometimes he'll put three six.
00:06:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, so that's Right then, 65, 1, 6, 6, I have 0.4, but in the rounds I have 69,000 gross attorney fees.
00:07:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Should be, well, I got another 20 last night, so it should be a little higher than that.
00:07:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Depending on when the report updates might not show up. So, like, if Salesforce is on East Coast time, then 9 o'clock last night would have been cut off for the report for today. Or yesterday. I don't know how it cuts off anyway. Anyway, okay. So, now your gross attorney fee, what is, is that target?
00:08:10 - Patrick Shahverdian
Exactly.
00:08:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Huh.
00:08:15 - Patrick Shahverdian
I think the gold a million.
00:08:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For the gross attorney fees for the month. Yeah. I know that number, but that's that's I don't even know how. Um, is that all together? Yeah. Oh, okay. Okay. makes more sense. It was like these numbers don't make sense with that. All right. Um. Yeah. The other thing is we've got leads have been dropping like crazy. We're.
00:08:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Thank you Mark yesterday in Arizona.
00:08:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Super slow right now. Oh, where's my Monday report? What day do go? The, the, I mean, California is super slow. We've only had four for California as a Monday, seven for Arizona, 11 for Washington, six for New Mexico. So Arizona is not slow compared to what else is happening right now. Washington is saving us. And at one point, and this is where knowing the numbers really comes in, Mark was just going to not do Washington at all. And then we went and crunch numbers in his way. And he was like, oh, that's not what I thought. So we get numbers for a reason and we track things for a reason. All right, so what I want to do today, the first thing I need is an update on reports. I need to know how you guys have been reviewing your cases for our conversation. Don't all speak up once now, calm down.
00:10:24 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, no, I mean, I started doing three review meetings a week, like we said. We're on pace, we haven't finished the full year since we switched to that, the full case list since we switched to that, but we're on pace to do two reviews per case every month.
00:10:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Two reviews per case every month?
00:10:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, that's every other week, we review each case every other week.
00:10:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so you will get through your entire case load twice a month.
00:11:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good job. All right. So I would like you. This is an assignment for both of you. I want you to keep a log. We can put it in a Google Doc, a shared Google Doc. And I want you to modify it. Let's just start it right now. File new document. All right. Week of, we'll say, 10, 14. I'm going to share my screen real quick. Shouldn't I open the Zoom now so I can do that? Levantage away.
00:12:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
She's okay. She's going to start doing a stereo interactions next week. I was her mindset and energy going through all that. She wasn't too on board that night. She spoke with a doctor and she's eager to get going.
00:12:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Keep her in the prayers. I'm going to update that tempo roll for you. Let's see. Okay, I, my brain just went out the door for a minute and it was with the birdies chirping. Okay, we're at 1014. So update on case to cover all cases. So this this is zoom gets in my way. I'll just tell you with all those little things here. What I'm thinking, what I would like you guys to do is just so with the increase case review and the increase effort on looking at your operations. I want you consciously in the morning, every day, be thinking about. In the way that you're looking, so there's doing your work and then there's looking at your work, right? And I know that you guys are looking at it and kind of evaluating it and figuring out like, Patrick, I know that one of your thoughts is, how do we get to higher numbers, right? How do I be top dog? So the answer to that is always going to be operations. It's good, right? So you're having those thoughts. What I want you guys to keep track of every week is let me know what you've noticed two parts, what you could and should be doing operationally to improve things and results that you notice from things that you have started doing. Because when you come to the call, I have to extract that and most of that extraction process takes up the majority of the call where. as if you're taking note of it real time as it happens as you see it, then our calls will become more effective and then we can take that information and use that strategically, which is tapping more into my power and which is a better use of Mark's investment in our time together. So I need you every day to just be looking at it, just every time you're looking at things. If something, if you notice it, I want you to go, you know what? I'm going to write that down so I can bring that back to Tina as a, that's a win or something we should work on or whatever, okay? Is this one o'clock meeting time just too close to after lunch? y'all just like...
00:15:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Now I think we're with both Patrick and I are introverts and so it's hard to get information out of us. We're just...
00:16:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, whatever. I'm just going to take it personally. Don't like me.
00:16:06 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So whatever.
00:16:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not fishing for compliments. I'm fishing for energy, but it's okay. Um, okay.
00:16:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
want to get a hard time getting things out of me.
00:16:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I am an ambiver. So like, I perk up when I'm around people that I like and I'm engaged with. But then afterwards, I don't want to talk to anybody for like hours at all. Like play my game or go to the gym or like do something that doesn't involve talking to people. I really love it, but also it drains the crap out of me. And so like I'll go to church and I'm all, no, whole time. And then people are like want to talk or call or something afterwards. And I will literally look at the phone and go go away. You never really like them. I'll be in the grocery store and somebody I really We love it there, and I'm like, oh, just like, no, bye. Anyway, okay, so when does that get it? Anyway, I have a job to do here, so I have to extract the things. So let's go to this, this is a little, I was wanting to work on, that's not the right one. Okay, so remember this that we was working on? Do, do, do, do, Yeah, we're breaking things down. So first, talk to me and let me know, we'll start with you Lorenz, has this popped into your head at all as to like these other things that have to happen and just talk to me about if any thoughts have come to you about the conversation we've had around this. And if it hasn't, that's okay. Yeah. it has.
00:18:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. Yeah, you know, a couple of things have come to mind, especially, you know, it's always stressful when the CM takes a couple of weeks off, because we have to reshuffle the teens, but it also provides an opportunity to see what's falling through the cracks and what, where our blind spots are. And so, taking on some of Jessica's case load, I've noticed there's a couple of things that are not getting done. And so, I'm actually, I had a brainstorm session with Mike today, and we're looking at maybe having a sort of flowchart based on this spreadsheet right here, and have maybe as simplified the process to where, you know, it's like a decision tree or something.
00:19:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If he doesn't have a very high rating, sorry, carry on.
00:19:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Another thing we noticed is that we review cases and assign tasks, but it seems like those tasks get lost into the ether. I write them down in the file review section of the case, but unless I know which we talked about last time, sometimes those tasks fall through the cracks. And so John and Viri and I have been experimenting with the task workflow on Slack to see what we can do. We're still tinkering with it, but I'm thinking about rolling it out, team-wide. And that would keep the tasks alive, so to speak. They wouldn't be just tucked away into the case file.
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that workloads are very good. There's this, and then I wonder if there's a slack workflow integration. So slack has a new thing. Do you use, like they have notes and almost like a project management kind of built into it? you have you seen that?
00:20:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Is it? No, I haven't played around. I've been, since last week, I've been working really heavily on the $6 million demand. so I haven't had a ton of time to work with slack and the ideas that I've had. haven't had a ton of time to implement them, but that's the demand was sent last night. So I'm going to start tinkering around with it. Is that have you played around with it?
00:20:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, so I don't use it a ton. I mostly use it. check things out at a workflow. Create a workflow. I have not used workflows on any of that work. Choose an event. So, like, you could go through the whole list of things that we have. Now, keep in mind that when you're innovating, generally, you're going to have rework. You're to do it again and again. Almost always, when you're creating a new system, it's not going to be great out of the gate. Sometimes it will create more problems than it solves. So, you want to fix that as quickly as possible. The best system is the one that gets used.
00:21:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, right, I want to be kind of, you know, idiot-proof. I'm not, you know, I'm using the expression, not calling my team idiots.
00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But, Oh, yeah. Well, also, we've talked about mental load before, right? So the system should reduce mental load. Basically, sometimes all you might need to start with would be a flow chart, because what can help with the mental load is the visual of this is the checklist, or even just this. There's a checklist. So creating something that's just kind of literally like boxes right here, right? Where check it, is it done for this case? I don't know how you structure and organize everything and how you have it and letify. And that's the problem, is that there isn't that kind of function built into Linify. And like Mark, so many different clients were like there, they try to get away from using spreadsheet. But because it feels like we work, right? We've already got all the data and solidify, but it's not when you can do certain types of functions and those functions reduce human error and things falling through the cracks. So there are also, and these are things that as we're thinking about it, because I've never had this thought before, so I'm glad that you brought that to the table, things like Zapier, which is, it's an automation integration with workflows and it's almost an if this, then that kind of thing. So let's say we get a new case and the case comes in and so then Zapier could go say, okay, mail it to whoever and then check and automatically follow up every two days. Did you do this? Did you do this? this? And so it creates a reporting system, never thought.
00:24:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I was looking when I first got hired here. was looking for something similar to that.
00:24:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I couldn't find any free service. It's not free.
00:24:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'm not compared for it.
00:24:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
00:24:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:24:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, and he loves automation actually, and he loves smarter stuff, and it's not expensive. And what we potentially might get into is hip butt or just like privacy and compliance type issues. So that's a conversation. But it's a meeting with him and Chona tomorrow night. I have a habit of forgetting things. I'm just going to. Email. You know what, I'm going email him. just told him I might need to go talk about this. And I want to talk to you about the questions for an idea about the runtime. This is just so I don't forget. I had to remember which words had already come out of my brain and into the message. That's how special it might be. Okay, so I like where you're going with that. I think the first step would definitely be just having the team have something like this look at it. So you can copy this. And this is shared with you, right?
00:25:52 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:25:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's good. You copy this and just show them, hey, this is in modify, you know, anything you want them, don't want them.
00:26:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
see whatever and just go like okay so you how do tasks get delegated does it just come in and people know and they grab it or do you use make assignments yeah so a couple of ways either through your case I say okay this needs to get done this needs to get done who's doing this who's doing that and they usually you know say okay I will do this and I say okay can we get this done within the next three days and then I write in the file review okay you say then though like is it a specific person or you just put it to the team like if I'm talking to Mike and Jess and a case we need some hospital records. We need to follow up on hospital records. Usually that'll be Mike's department. And so I'll say, you know, hey, Mike, can you get this done for the next three days? And I'll put on the file review, needs hospital records, Mike, by this day, and then I'll initial and date it.
00:27:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me see if this is the right one or if it's a list. feel like it might be a list. But, um, well, I don't want to do it in here because she is in there. I'm just creating a new channel. Hi, Canvas. For templates. You Okay, ours might work. Let's do okay ours and see what we get here. I mean, you could completely rework this or create one from scratch, but they have, I like these also, the lists, you should explore this. So these are just basically tasks, follow up with whatever case, lot, whatever, and then assign a person to it, open item, you can put the status, you can put the date that it's due. And I imagine the workflows could kind of work like this, but If that is something that we could explore, I'm trying to figure out the best way to go about this because I love that you have this idea, how interested would you be in going Canvas and workflows? Do you enjoy that stuff at all?
00:29:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, depending on the length, I don't want to sit through a 45 minute video. No.
00:29:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
somebody can't explain it in five minutes, I bounce anyway.
00:29:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:29:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just to get an overall concept where you're like, okay, I can see a little bit about how to do this. I mean, if you're good at finding somebody, um, good at a chat GPT. Hey, my guy.
00:30:10 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
They have pretty good, you know, solution driven, uh, response. I don't love them for drafting, like, things, but as far as the technical solutions.
00:30:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, with two case managers and a, and a little assistance, we get approximately, we have approximately, how many cases do have?
00:30:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Uh, two, thirty-ish.
00:30:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We get approximately how many new ones a month, like six, no, ten, how many.
00:31:02 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'll you in a second, I'll just look at September, I'll look at September.
00:31:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The last Now, because this month we only got five so far. That's our do you ever use chat GPT?
00:34:06 - Patrick Shahverdian
I've never used it before.
00:34:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, we will break it down right now. Good question. Okay. Task assignment. How are tasks currently assigned to your team members? there specific categories of tasks you'd like to automate? Currently they are assigned manually through. I should say tasks specifically because. Are there specific categories of tasks that you'd like to automate? do you have a standard set of tasks that can be templated?
00:34:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Not yet.
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What we have this right I'm actually so I'm gonna do this one and drag it down No dummy Why did you be too? Whoa, it just happened Copy and pasting from Excel can be You Let's see, due dates, prior shows, do you have an existing system for setting up due dates, due date, systems, non-existent, really, just effectively, we don't have a super structured, you check, you look kind of thing.
00:36:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I'm the structure system.
00:36:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Prioritization, how flexible are these deadlines? Okay, so I do have target timelines for how long tasks should take as well. As as order. of past dependencies, and minimum contacts from, will say, maximum, um, and between contacting clients, and then if you don't talk to them, when else, Patrick? If you've gone or you just dipped up on your video, because you should be paying attention to this also, I mean, if we don't talk to them with, I see a chap or something, sorry, need to take this call, okay cool. If we don't talk to them within a certain amount of time, we need to follow up with them. Okay. Tracking a reminder, if you prefer Slack to handle reminders, or do notifications automatically, would you like to manually set custom reminders for each task or their specific intervals? It wants to set the reminder, timeline frequency, parameters, and then have it be automatic via Slack there. What key performance indicators would you like to see in the reports? Keep the eyes. On track back. That's about it. How many days over. do would also be good. Want to improve the overall speed. Closing cases, Instagrams with other tools, no other tools integrated. Actually, we use a program called Lidify. Right? She's a sales force. I want to track clients. Automation scope. Do you want to automate the creation of recording tasks? I want to use as much automation. As is prudent to accomplish my goals without over complicating the process or creating too much dependency on tech. The goal is save mental workload and time. And improve speed of case resolution. We have answered all the questions.
00:40:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Good thing for a minute.
00:40:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You hope.
00:40:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I hope I hope the reason he has to take that call is because he's getting that 500,000. I'll see.
00:40:51 - Patrick Shahverdian
Now. State Farm being a B.
00:40:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
State Farm being state farm.
00:40:58 - Patrick Shahverdian
Now that adjusters. running from you know They used to call me every day when I wasn't ready to like present the case and now that I'm ready.
00:41:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They don't answer the phone Task on it it deals very art of warish. You'd be like, have you ever every day Every single day Did it get it? Okay Task templates we can set up reusable templates for each of the 20 main tasks you had on the case This will allow you to quickly assign tasks for team members with predefined due dates and reminders Task dependencies Incorporate task dependencies to ensure certain because like you've got and I'm sure you know what task dependencies are But some of these can't be done until other ones are done. That's the task dependency So just just a rule in the same page Setting up automated reminders to find standard timelines for each task category or to police report two days prepare demand letter Look at this. I already like using our step and put in and in here, KPIs because we already did this, this is the thing about compounding how step builds upon things, right? So having clear definition and putting the tasks with accurate language in there has led to you having that brainstorm and us doing this. Everything that you do feeds the next thing that you do. Like one of these days we're going to get to the point where Mark's going to be like, holy crap, what just happened to the scene? Watch me. Watch, watch you. Watch y'all. Let's go. Okay. Define standard timelines. already did that right. So KPI monitoring reporting, basic reports, which is all I expected. Use Slack integrations or other reporting tools to show the status and trust tasks on track, off track. Overdo monitoring, automate alerts, that's to do that integration with notify tracks, key client case, and see if it can connect with Slack. don't know. We should have known that already. So if it doesn't know, it has some plates. Would you want these templates to include pre-set due dates based on typical case timelines? Oh, we're going to refresh this because it broke. I'm good for breaking chat due to day two.
00:43:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Do you have a paid version or the free version?
00:43:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Boy, please, do I look like the free person? Whatever is available, I'm getting it when it comes to technology, because, yeah, my guy, though, he's so funny. He knows I love tech, so I was, I don't remember where I think I was in Vegas, and I went there and he rented a car for me, and I don't even remember what it was, but it was super high tech. And he's like, yeah, because I know you love technology, yeah, do you understand learning curves? I'm like, I don't know how to use this car. It's cool. But I just want to get where I'm supposed to go right now, like, you're like, yeah, anyway, you can just like. I don't want to take on a person. I mean, you can't even give me time to play. Okay, create task templates, develop reusable, a more of direct, blah, blah, Automation triggers. Yeah. Okay. And wait, oh, you're asking me questions. Why? That's too much work. Um, so I don't want to answer any more questions. Um, what can you do to give me something I can do to slack, to get going right now. This is how Tina operates. What's the shortcut, homie? I need it.
00:44:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
This is the workflow builder. Click create. Set a trigger to the triggers.
00:44:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have anybody? Do either of you have anybody that's nerdy that would like to, like, play with this and set this up?
00:44:58 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah, Isaac.
00:44:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Isaac. Isn't Isaac like on paternity leads?
00:45:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, is he already?
00:45:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know.
00:45:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I know he's going on paternity leads. Are we gonna get a set?
00:45:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think part two. Yeah. I don't. I don't. That's not the easiest role to fill. Mark still calls him Noren sometimes and Noren was the dude before Isaac. So I'm like, stop that.
00:45:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's so rude. It's a such a nice guy too.
00:45:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have to tell Mark to behave himself multiple times a day. So he's like, no, I'm like, did your last name is sweet? Just try it. No. All right. Um, it's good thing he tolerates me. Go to work. I don't want to do that. Yeah. So we need somebody. So explore Zapier and Salesforce integration tools. So I don't think that exists. Just starting with Slack, using the workflows as and the reminders should be a really, really good start. So showing your teams, okay, really keep in mind and frame this with your teams, look. And I love to start with a question. Do like, and everybody gets paid differently and their incentivize differently, but like, you would ask them like, how do you feel about our monthly goals? That's very open-ended. And they'd be like, what do you mean? How do you feel about our monthly goals? It's okay. They can be uncomfortable. You can just sit there and stare at them until they give you an answer. Be okay with that. It's okay. Don't leave the question, just let them. And they'd be like, you know, they don't say anything. So then the next question can be, do you want to help the team hit the monthly goals? How important is that to you? Now watch them. Be honest. video call or be in the office with them because their face will tell you the real answer. If they are like, you know, make that little micro expression of just like confusion if they're level dot, like they don't immediately say, obviously I want to do it, right? Then they're like, man, you need to know that. You need to know that. Okay, because if that's not incentivizing them, but then you need to come at it from another angle, like, knowing that hitting our goals is a requirement for all of us to have job security. How interested are you in hitting our goals in order to not have to worry about having another job? Now, frame that the way you need to by the person that you're talking to, okay, don't use my language. But
00:48:01 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That sounds very threatening, like inspired.
00:48:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, okay, that's what I'm telling you. Look, I don't have the time to think pretty. know you guys can do better. Don't talk like me or people will hate you and be scared about your jobs. They're jobs. Okay, so don't do that. Yeah, anyway, I'll ask GPT before I have please reward my my this sentence so that people don't feel threatened with their jobs, but Here's the thing though, they're grown-ups and you have to realize that your metrics matter and your ability to hit the goals matter. They're not random goals. There are profit margins involved in the business. The goals are set based on the profit margins. Okay, a lot of money is spent on marketing and a lot of money and excessive amount of money is spent on incentive program. It is not super- for profitable this model that's here. these goals are very important. Now, the goals, if everybody is rowing in the same direction in the boat, we get there faster and better, right? Yeah. So you, I'm giving you the overall conversation that needs to happen. You have to finesse it with your people. Don't be like, Tina said to do this and I'm like, everybody wants to quit and they're scared blah, I'm not, no, I have a recording. I did not say just go, don't do it. But you want to read them. You want to have a conversation and read them and know how interested they are in hitting the goals and making things work well. Now, if that angle doesn't work, the other angle is, you know, how much would you like to see things go smoother without really having to put more effort into it? How would you like to kind of just reduce them, the mental load of the... the job but still get things done and it's a little bit easier. Most of people would say yes. The reason that's important is because in the beginning this is going to seem like more like a pain in the butt. Systems and organization take setup and they take getting used to. Old dogs, new tricks, that kind of thing. People just tend to not want to do it. So you want to frame it with ultimately this is going to make less work, less stress, easier to get to the goal line without sitting there going wait what should I be doing. You'll know exactly what you should be doing when and why and how you're doing. But also when somebody is sick and when somebody is not there, everything's already assigned. You've also got historical data about what's been done and how much has been done. It will help you with reviewing your team in a good way. It's saying like, man, you've been doing awesome. All these tasks, because I've been done on time. And then you'll also be able to look at, because you can go and alitify and see, you know, what's the average days to close, or resolution, and give them that and go look at that. This is improving. Patrick, you're still new, but, you know, you'll be able to look at that and just know what your targets are from the beginning once you start separating and having your own cases, not any mixed with Mark, whatever. Like, your day is kind of dirty in the beginning, but it'll be really good. So, but in order to get people to not be negative and go, you know, talk, and also the other thing that you should tell them, like if you've got problems with the issue, you need to bring it to me, but what's not okay is to go murmuring around and being negative about these things. So. So yes, it's new. The point of it is to make the job easier, easier as for to cover each other when somebody's out, and less like trying to keep track of everything in our head and just kind of see how we're doing. Like unless you're the kind of person that just like, hope somebody's looking at your work, then you're probably in the wrong firm because that's not how many things here. So anyway, I think you guys should have that conversation and then we should find somebody and it could be one of you guys, it shouldn't be that hard. Or we can set our next conversation next Tuesday and we can go into Slack and walk through this and do it together, set it up in one account. then if we can duplicate it to another one, like maybe create, I don't know, new channels. I don't know how it would have to go. We'll figure that out as we do it. But worst case scenario, if you don't have anybody that you can deputize, you'd be interested in doing doing this. And Isaac, if Isaac is around and he would like to do it, that'd be awesome. Especially because he can, he can share that with Mark and go back and forth there. But this is a great idea. This is a perfect follow up with this conversation that we had. And really could lead to really, like I said, reduce mental load. Because you're visually going, this is where everything stands. And automatic reminders and follow-ups. You don't have to sit there and follow up with your team constantly. Slack is doing it for you. And then you get to see, well, are they doing what they're supposed to? Are they checking it? Now, the other thing that will happen is Slack notifications are going to increase. So that can overwhelm some people.
00:53:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That is the one thing I want to be careful with because we did have let-ify notifications. When I first came in, every time we open the case, let-ify- And I think it was like 22 different emails for tasks that needed to be done for case opening. And so every single case was 22 emails.
00:54:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so eventually, no one even looked down. Right. So you can modify how the notifications work so that either they can disable notifications on there and just manually go in and check their stuff. You can do it so that it's push notifications, but not email notifications email notifications, but not push notifications. There's all kinds of different ways you can set it up and on the on the company level, but as well as like in the way that you structure the reminders and the alerts as well as the way that your people have it. So how they get notified is totally up to them as long as the job. gets done. If they're not getting the job done, then it's an issue, right? And also, all of these tasks already exist, like mentally, these notifications should be happening anyway, like, hey, you got to do this, hey, you got to do this. This is the nature of the job. There is a lot to do, a lot of cases, a lot of clients, a lot of tasks within it. So the reality is this already exists. If their preference is, I don't want to see it because it's too much, you know, that's a problem because this is the job. So that's another way to look at it. Now, you can have it set so that maybe you only get pinged if something's overdue or maybe you only get pinged one time per case or whatever. I don't know how it works. Again, we'll have to modify it and you can let people know that. Meantime, if they're getting overwhelmed, they can snooze their notifications with Slack, and they can just go in and check under their little red alert tab, right? they've got going on. This will be, so the goal is to work through the system as quickly as possible. So all the feedback that you get, like having them, I give you actual real feedback, not complaints, right? like, not this sucks. Okay, this sucks. What's a better alternative that you can think of? You bring a problem to the table, always also bring a potential solution. Okay, you can bring all the problems you want to, as long as you also bring a potential solution. Otherwise, it's just complaining, and anybody got time for that? Yeah, I told you all this one of them about that already. Yeah, anyway, you ain't trying to solve the problem. You just the problem, and I ain't got time for problems. Now you got to go. I just spent some time in the ghetto every now and And then it comes out, and my girls like to tell me about it. They don't even know how much I hold back. Like legit, get it. Like I go on to English class, and my friends are like, yo, check this out. He's got a nine millimeter right here. I'm like.
00:57:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
What?
00:57:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that was my life. Like I had a friend, as soon as I moved out of there, she got shot in the head by some gangsters because they were just out hanging around. And these guys from Houston, they were bad news. And then a few weeks later, another one of my friends, who was like, he was a star people, basketball, phenom, and like on a role student. And he's in prison for life because these guys shot somebody and said, you're going to take the blame for it. And if you tell anybody, we'll kill your whole family. So nobody ever said anything. That was a fun couple of years.
00:57:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:57:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, so if you see some crazy, crazy. Come out. It's real.
00:58:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You're not coming out.
00:58:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
God put me where I needed to be so I could understand what I need to understand. And whatever. That's all it is. But every now and it comes out. So yeah. Anyway, um, this is great. Uh, Patrick, um, really do need you to calm down like I can't handle energy. What are you really impressed with this GBT thing? Well, that's what I was going to ask you like, what do you what do you think about this? Like, what's I know you're always thinking and I know you're engaged, but I would love to know just kind of your thoughts about today's conversation.
00:58:45 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah, um, I do know like, let's say we have like these, I don't know, 15 things that need to happen throughout a case. Like, it's like a kind of seesaw like this part of it starts to fall off and we remind the team.
00:59:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and make sure we need to do this and then that that's being done like perfectly and then the other side like the basic stuff starts to like get missed so it's like I don't know if it's something about you know being able to see it in order for them to not forget but it will help it will help a lot so one of the things that I think that whoa actually meeting myself um that we might do and again please frame this with your team and let them know that this is a work in progress that there is this is going to be probably really clunky in the beginning and maybe more of a pain than it seems like it's worth but if they will stick with it we will make a system that works well for everybody and it makes at least some improvement for everybody and from everybody's perspective if we're wrong about that you got a person that probably ought to go because really it should be something that everyone can get benefit from. The only reason that wouldn't be is one if they're just that negative or two, they don't contribute to developing the system. Meaning they've made suggestions, they've explained with some kind of articulate eloquence why something doesn't work, so we can figure out a workaround. But at the end of the day, things are falling through the cracks and not getting done the most efficiently possible. The goal is not perfection, the goal is progress, but progress doesn't continue to come without being intentional about it. You can't just show up and be like, hey, you know, I'm going to do what I do. Progress comes from strategically planning how to improve doing what you do, right? So that's what this is about. So to that point, Patrick, one of the. things that theoretically, because I've not used Slack like this, I have used lots of other project management suites. But I don't want to create a new application that you guys have to log into. So I love the Slack idea, Lauren, by the way, good job. And I love you, Brad, chat to me too. I was like, I just know you got to do that. I'm such a nerdy girl. literally be talking to chat to you in the middle like, okay, how do you write this? How do you figure out this? I had an hour session with my 14 year old daughter trying to plan her career because she's like, what's a good place that they have lots of pets, but not a lot of vets, because she wants to be vet. So we talked to chat TBT and it's like Aurora, Colorado, and then we were off to the races for like an hour. Anyway, hang on, Lauren, real quick. So, Patrick, what we should be able to get is notice a pattern like, like you just said, right? If we start doing this, then this dips off. We start doing this and this dips off. What you'll probably find is that just paying attention to things, so just thinking about how different operations have been for you guys just because you thought about it differently. We had conversations, it stuck in your head, it popped into your head throughout the week, you're like, oh, you know what? I'm going to go do this. That's what will happen with your team too. They're like, there's just something changes as soon as you create awareness. So there's the level of awareness of just, oh yeah, like that's a lot of stuff that has to happen in the case, and it has to happen with every case. And there's kind of like a timeline that has to happen, and then when you add in the fact that you're looking at your cases and Lorenz you're like, or either one of you like, hey, it's been three weeks, nobody's checked in to see and make sure, you know, client didn't die. Everything's okay. We've still got a number. that works. All, you know what I mean? Like, once a week, at least are hearing from us, Hey, we're just checking on you, letting you know where we're at. You know, nothing has really changed, but wanted you to know we're here, we're working for you. That kind of thing. You're doing that. Your whole team needs to do that. So the more visuals we have here, right, the more structure that they're looking at, if they can see the tasks and slack, if they can see the outline of these or all the things that have to happen, instead of trying to keep it in their head every day going, wait, what do we need to do? Like, did somebody leave me the correct notes about what I need to do next? Do I already know what I need to do next instead of sitting there for two or three minutes ago? Oh, yeah. The next thing is, out of those two or three minutes over a week, over each person, over a month, over a year, we're talking tens of hours at the very least that we're saving doing this. And that's on your best day. Sometimes people going to show up with a migraine, you got women sometimes are going be cramping. Sometimes and somebody's gonna be hurting, depressed, whatever, all kinds of things, right? The mental lag time multiplies at times like that. So this mitigates some of just the humanness and the weakness that we have. And but also really helps everyone to see how is the whole case flow doing, even if I'm not the one doing it. And again, if somebody's like all of a sudden, I'm gonna be out for two months. Well, what has Mike been handling? What's been Mike been on top of? like, look at all those mics. I got to give that to somebody else. Holy crap, know, like Lauren's you're going through this stuff right now. So it's a process, you get some insight with the insight comes some improvement. And also with the insight comes more burden to an extent because now you have a new awareness that, oh, we're actually to not doing so great on this. But overall, it creates lifts, it creates traction. And as you've seen, Patrick, now with chat GBT, you'll notice one of the things that we improve a lot is just the mental effort. We're reducing the mental load and leveraging the mental effort. Chat GBT, if we can use Slack, so you're not having to manually remind everybody, chat GBT, helping us strategically plan it. It's not real AI. It's just logic. If this, then not. It's got a database of questions to ask, but for the most part, the output is equivalent to the input. So if we ask it really good questions and logic, it's not going to come up with anything we couldn't have done ourselves most of the time, but it will get there much faster so that we can process the next question, the next step, and so on. And so, anyway. But At the end of it comes, your cases get done faster. More reliably, we should be seeing better incentive pay. also within, so timeline, roughly 90 days. It's going to be a pain in the butt for roughly 90 days. The first 90 days are lots of growing pains. It takes about 90 days to work out and create the first iteration of a sick, the first successful iteration of a project management system with a small team. I'd say 45 to 90 days. Okay, so bear that in mind. Think about whatever is important to your team, especially that this is going to help us a lot when somebody's not available or the team changes or you're just having a rough day and we can't keep track of everything. thing. The goal of this is not micromanagement. The goal of this is not to create more work. So ask them to have a little faith and try to be part of the team making the process better. Okay.
01:07:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Sounds good.
01:07:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good luck with those conversations. And then the notes. didn't share this with you. I need to share this with you. Where did it go? Which, which, I don't know where I put it, where the crap. That was on it. Oh, was it here? Yes. Okay. Share. What are you guys going to do? What's that?

## Quote 24

> 00:00:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Hey, how are you doing?
00:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Apparently too eager to meet me because I got here to meet.
00:00:11 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, yeah, I to double check. Double check myself.
00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
not going to meet you early then too late, but I woke up and I got immediately had missionary meetings to go to and anyway, I was just been like, oh, I'm on to my next meeting and yeah, anyway, so I gotcha.
00:00:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. When you said I woke up, I finished the sentence in my head as soon as when you said I woke up, I was like, I woke up and I chose violence.
00:00:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I, I don't know why I just feel like, well, I eat, so how do you feel about Tina? Well. The vibe she gives off is she chews this balance. I can't be like that. really wrong. I'm coming down in my old age. feel like this mission is probably really good for my attitude. Anyway, so I put notes on your last... Oh wait, okay, so just the invoice thing just to keep up with it. because I put them on, what think go automatically every month? And then when we started back, it was the first of whatever month it was like April. And so there's another one automatically going to come in a few days.
00:01:40 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Is there...
00:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that right?
00:01:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Is there anything wrong? No, there's nothing wrong. I guess I just got off in my... I probably was late on one of the earlier ones.
00:01:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and then... So there's a remind function that I can use, and I just wanted to make sure, you know, because in the beginning, like I think your finances have straightened out and whatever, but I just want to make sure everything's okay. And then if it, we need to adjust it, let's adjust it.
00:02:18 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, I mean, yeah, it's finances. The third month in my cycle of billing with titans and everything. I consistently get to that third month and it's like, oh, this is going to be, this is going to be tight. I've got, you know, I've got nine grand in my account right now. And that's for the rest of August and September. And I'll have mean, a little bit from VA and BAM. I have some money coming from Tim, which he, I'm talking with him. He wants to renegotiate, so I'm talking with him about that now to do a profit partner deal with him, so he wants to scale back to, he asked me to scale back to 3K a month, and so I talked with him, got on the Zoom last week and was like, you know, obviously like I can't, if we, if we do two things. So one, we ran that one promotion, you know, you, you, you did a little over 40k, one person signed up for your mastermind, and he, and he was, you know, that, and I think he's got some, some um, uh, some amex debt that he's dealing with, because I heard him mention he's paying like 2,500 a day on it.
00:04:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
00:04:12 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So I think he's got, yeah, a day. Wow. I think he's got some, uh, I think the money just comes in and it goes, but he's got a big event that I'll be at next month in Chicago and I've been really not installing it.
00:04:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, sorry. I'm just like, so anxious right now because I'm so upset and I'm trying to hold my mouth.
00:04:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay. Keep going. Sorry. Yeah. And so I, um, you know, I've been promoting that event, uh, for him because that's really when he wanted to focus on and because that's where he sells people into his mastermind and we've got more people attending this event than any of the past five. um, know, he converted 25% of the room last year. if he does that this year, you know, that's like a little over 700 grand to him. So he may feel different post event. But I told him that we got to reduce the scope. If we're doing 3k, I said a way around that. And this is why I proposed to him. And he said, he'd give me a half, a half yes on this because he likes, he just wants to think about it. So I said him the proposal. And I went ahead and I invoiced him for 3k because I need that money. I need some of that 5k coming in this month. But it would be 5% of gross sales that I bring in, including evergreen funnels that I build. And so in my goal would be you know, make up that extra, you know, 2K a month, but also it's like, well, he, the other thing in my mind is like, well, I probably, I probably need to go ahead and get working on another client as well that can pay me the 5K. And, you know, I do, I do like working with him and his team, you know, there's something to be said for that. He paid me, he's paid me 20 grand so far. So, I, as I did in Moison for the 3, and I got that and then, and his whole thing, he said, it's not that you, like, is nothing that you're, you're doing, like, he, he, like, likes to work and he just isn't able, I guess isn't able to afford 5k. So I feel like there's something to be said for, you know, he's not breathing them my neck. Like I have pretty much full autonomy. So there's some pros and cons there. So I'm trying to be flexible and also stand up for myself too. so if he were to say, you know, I'm not going to do the 5% of growth of what you sell, I'll probably just eke out another month or to a 3k and find some how to replace it. But also I said the near-road scope would be like I'm just going to focus on creating and running promotions. under this new deal and you know because they'll ping me like for I mean just random stuff and it doesn't take me that long but but that kind of stuff I would just you know back away from and not not do any more you're updating existing sales page copy that I'm not really involved in or anything like that or that we don't have a promotion for so so that kind of stuff would would go away and I would just focus on activities that bring me in that I can earn them and so I think it's a really good deal for him and so I think he'll say yes I I send it to him I sent it to him on Friday, yes, sent him Friday, and I know he's looked at it, he hasn't replied. I'll follow up with him before the gross summit next week just to confirm that he saw it and say let's connect after gross summit because I think that he'll be in a happier place once he has that influx of new members, and I've helped him with the order form that he's going to pass out at gross summit and a little bit with his presentation of how he's going to pitch our encircle. So, mean, I think that like today, he got an email deliverability warning from Keep because the spam complaints are getting a little high and he asked me if I could take a look look and you know that that's one of those things is like that's that's definitely out of scope but i but i know that he's using email smart which is Adriene sappages software okay and and so i did send a talk about sending email to the because i know those guys really well because they we have brian so i just an email see if they can advise or consult with him but i'm not going to work on his email deliverability um so well we're seeing that that leads but i yeah there they're kind of two things floating in my mind is like man i'm tired of getting to that third month and and just feeling the crunch and and i did have a couple of expenses that i didn't anticipate one was paying my EPA that I thought I'd already pay back in in tax season, but we did an extension that we're filing now. And I guess he built me now. So that was like 1,700 bucks that I wasn't expecting. And then there were, there were some kid expenses on the personal side, but can I dig into this a little bit real quick?
00:11:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. So first of all, let's cut my bill in half because you don't talk to me at all other than our meetings. So like, you know, extra effort, and it's old prices and we'll just, you're just grandfathered and keep what I charged hourly basically. So we'll cut that in half. That's not a huge out, but it's something and it let us keep working together. Because that's really important to me. Yeah, me too.
00:11:59 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
If you like it. I do.
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so we'll start that next invoice. If you see it and I haven't fixed it yet, because I can forget between now and two minutes that I need to do that, just pee me back and say, Hey, don't forget. And then I'll fix it. Okay. It would just be an oversight. It wouldn't be. I changed my mind. know. And then if you end up being a little bit late, because you're in a crunch or whatever, however, don't about it. It'll just need to take care of it when you take care of it. Yep.
00:12:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's one thing.
00:12:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. This guy.
00:12:35 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
What's his face? Top home?
00:12:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tim. Tim, Tim. So, um, he's, he's feeling the pain of his mismanagement and his errors and a lot of times people will displace that responsibility or just make really dumb choices because they're not in a good way. one of the things. things that you can do is the math, because the numbers tell the truth, right? So what you do is you put in a spreadsheet and you compare the price that he's paid you and the money that you know you've helped him earn. And the no brainer math that says, uh, we've our, I've already earned that. Okay. But in addition to that, that there's the unquantifiable kind of help that I've given you that hasn't been measured, such as this kind of advice, this kind of consulting and, and peer support really. Um, and, and so, you know, so it's, and, and you are not in the business of charity. And I would, I would really say these things in your way, but I think that this, this is one of those things that you write up or you do like in a video, so that you have a chance to really kind of script it out in your head. And so that you don't get interrupted and shift your energy. So he doesn't like argue and persuade or anything because sometimes people like that, especially when they're desperate, they really try to control the conversation. Yeah. And you need to make sure that his ego doesn't get in the way. So if it's if it's a long text or video, he can't argue with those things as much. He might end his brain, but he gets a little bit of space where nobody's listening to him and watching him and where he can manage his ego if he chooses to. So it gives him a better chance to be able to deal with his ego if you handle it that way. And I would imagine he might want to, because if we don't manage our egos, then, you know, we sabotage. But so you give him the math and show him, like, obviously, I've already earned my cape and I want to do more. This lights me up. I enjoy it. I understand the financial problems that you're in. I've been there. for myself. However, here's what I know. Getting rid of the golden egg, the golden goose kind of thing, or getting rid of the money producers out of a scarcity mindset is absolutely the wrong thing to do. And I'm going to put my time somewhere that is going to come back to me. You know, that's just business. But also in this economy, everybody's got to manage their resources. Well, I only have so much time and so much mental effort to apply to a project. So I'm not going to put it where I constantly feel like I have to prove myself or somebody doesn't understand the value. So I'd like you to take some time to contemplate this, look at the numbers and reevaluate. And you know, you could just read, read, restate that. That's why this offer is good, because I see your value. I know what you could earn. I know that there's a good potential for me and I'm willing to have some skin in the game by instead of requiring this 5,000 that I'm going give you my minimum. What do I call that?
00:16:10 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Retainer, base retainer, base retainer.
00:16:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Man, it's been so long since I've used the base retainer. I forgot what it's called. This base retainer, which basically ensures that I am not a victim of your poor money management. And of course, you're going to probably want to tweak that, but that's the truth of it is sometimes people manage their money bad in case in point 2,500 day on an AMEX. Something went wrong there. So it's just a matter of being bold but so respectful using the numbers and then forcing accountability. Make a decision, but just know that if your decision is to devalue me, I don't have that issue.
00:16:56 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I'll move on.
00:16:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's the The one thing about that. So cut my bill in half, my suggestion for how you handle that. I do think you should take another client because I feel like we're right now at that. know, we we felt a recession was going to come and then it was artificially inflated. that's the great vine and you listen to the conversations that are happening. There's a lot of people that are not having money, a lot of coaches, a lot of whatever in the industry. It's definitely not hurting the labor industry. It's so crazy. You still can't get laborers for anything skilled laborers, whether they're fixing cars and mechanics or HVAC or doing nail technicians and hair. Like people are still spending all that money. But in the education world and the coaching world, that's changed. anyway, so that and then I would love to dig into T, what you're doing with Ryan. Oh yeah, the one question I wanted to ask you with. Tom was, have you ever tracked your time and kind of come up with an effective hourly rate for you? And what I would like you to do is if you do that three thousand dollars, if you can create it so that you're spending less time and that you maintain a similar effective hourly rate to what you were doing at five thousand, because you modified your scope, then you should be able to be okay with that too, because three thousand is nothing to sneeze at, if you work well together, then that could grow. And if you're not, if it's not costing you more time, like if you're, you know what I mean, if you're correlating that correctly, then then there's no reason to not do it.
00:18:50 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, that kind of, I haven't done effective hourly rate, but I have, I did just look at like, all right, what is, Because I had to, you know, my days are kind of tasks, their tasks are driven. so my mornings are most productive. so I was giving, you know, a couple hours dedicated in the morning to thinking and working on Tim's stuff. And then I was becoming more, I was keeping more of an eye on the Discord chat. I even got, I put it on my phone and I was getting notifications on my phone. And then I took that off after this 3K because I was like, well, I'm not going to have those dinging me anymore to take up just more of my brain space. But I was kind of thinking that, like, yeah, I could give it 3K. And if I'm earning on what I sell, then then I kind of feel like, you know, a couple hours dedicated in the morning for really four days a week because Fridays I treat little bit differently. But for Monday through Thursday, I have started, I'll spend like no more than 90 minutes on either Saturday or Sunday, sometimes both in the morning after coffee, just, I don't really do coffee work, but I do more like planning and organizing and thinking about the week ahead. So, which I don't mind. doing that. So sometimes Tim is, Tim is definitely in that thinking. But so is Brian and everybody else fits. So I mean, that cadence has been, has been good for me. But that's kind of what I've been thinking is like I'm going to limit it to, you know, like two hours a day. For I have a Monday meeting with him and the team. That's an hour. And then I do a 30 minute call with this girl Amanda, Amanda Dake. don't know if you've ever lost pass with her, but she's another consultant. She's effectively, I guess, his fractional CMO. And she's great. I really like working with her. So that's really like, I'm trying to limit my time and the week for Tim, if the 3K ends up being what sticks, and especially if he, I don't think he's going to balk at the Refshare thing.
00:22:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But... I'm sorry, I only have one, don't know, there's two amount of days I have mutual friends. D-A-K-E. Oh, D-A-K-E?
00:22:28 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, D-A-K-E. She's got a girl in here.
00:22:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've seen her face, maybe he's just with the Titan stuff, but we're not connected.
00:22:38 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Anyway, sorry. Okay. She's really more project management, and she's handling the, like all the hotel stuff for his growth summit, all the negotiations, food, menu, that kind of stuff. But she's got a marketing brain, she's got good ideas too. you.
00:23:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how much time, because I was listening and I feel like you said like 90 minutes a day for him?
00:23:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Two hours a day.
00:23:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Two hours a day for 10. So like 10 hours a week.
00:23:19 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
And that was before? Before I was doing more than that, like I would do my creative output for a couple hours a day. And then I was a little more active in the Discord. And I get one off request for help with preexisting copy and that kind of thing. Or if I'm like I would sometimes write scripts for his, it's really his assistant. she's she's the one handling the like the direct messaging in the in the Facebook group. And this is not her not told him that like this is not her skill set. She doesn't. She's not a cell. She's an appointment setter. She's not a sales person like that's that's who he's using. Instead I was writing to help her be more successful which would help ultimately help me be more successful. I was writing scripts for her and I probably still do that on a specific promotion that I was running because I would see that as you know that like her her follow-up matters um when we're we're in a week where we're making an offer.
00:24:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Doing a quick EHR. affected hourly rate calculation. So we can just, then I'm going to, sorry, bring it only due to things at once. Let me screen share, because this is safe for you as a value calculator that we created to create some like offer calculations. We don't really use it, but can you see? Yeah. And so what do you think you worked before? Like how many hours a week? were talking about it, but I didn't hear it specific.
00:25:38 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I probably gave him three to four hours a day.
00:25:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A day? So we'll say 3.5 times five days a week, right? safe for some. Okay, three point five times five, so we'll say seventeen point five Well, I gotta bring this down five That's crazy First of all that it's not very much We really should do this for everything And I really think you need to do this because You know, you're more valuable than that. Yeah, way more valuable than that And let's do one more thing earned for The name And So we're gonna call that Yes. Um, Tom, let's do this for a Titan. Let's do this for tea. And let's set a baseline of, well, for sure, you don't make less than that.
00:27:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
But then let's start doing these calculations and make sure that that numbers start growing to a minimum of $250 an hour.
00:27:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Because, I mean, when we go do this, when we go start plugging in these numbers. And so let's, we'll do this drag up. Man, you need to use this for your profit partners modified a little bit. I'll put it in my, my stuff that I'm teaching, um, because everybody needs to do this. so you just take it. You could say, you could say you got it from Tina, that'd be nice, you know, but you don't have to. But But give this if you teach people this. Okay, because they need no so so we'll call this a month Jan 2024 and I'll just I don't think it's gonna let me drop. Yeah, okay, so If I did a few of this Let's do this oh I Think if you do if I do it a couple times hold on hold on. I I want to I want to do it myself Chris Let's do 24 and then 03 24 if you if you highlight this three and then go it'll finish it You know sometimes you have to train it with a few things because it doesn't have enough, but anyway, okay, so I um and then obviously we don't need these to be so big and no you want to there okay hold on oh tina don't don't watch me don't look at me and i really shouldn't even be doing this yet until i populated this video i want it to be but anyway we drag this out you can put this and anything new and if you go populate this and then do some math um i think that you'll figure out what your target EHR should be and um also kind of your return on investment by the hour for them let's really start digging into what you're earning people versus what you're getting compensated because you have a kind of ambiguous value in your head and their head. And we want to make that crystal clear. So your ambiguous version is you know that you're worth way more. Their ambiguous version is probably the same, but they struck themselves and let them believe that you know that they're justified in this until you do the math. And then you can take yourself off the table and be like at some point, right? Obviously you can't right now, but there's going to come a point. But I can tell you when I did this exercise for the first time, everything changed. I'm like I am making people millions. The first time I did it, I went bankrupt making people millions and that just made me mad. then, you know, still making people millions and getting Trump change for it. And I'm like, I got to change this. And when I, the value that when I really understood my value differently, I held myself differently, I conducted myself differently. And it was off putting to the types of people that would take advantage of me because they just recognized I wasn't the one they were going to be able to manipulate. Because there's lots, most people have really no idea. They have an ambiguous right. But they don't have a crystal clear like, I am 100% worth this. So then what happened is I started attracting people who are like, I want to pay Tina, I want to pay her. Like she's valuable. I want to pay her. You're one of those. And it doesn't even if they can't there's a difference between can't and won't. Yeah, you know, and so you want to be in the trenches for the people that can't but would. I want to be in the trenches with you.
00:32:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I worked for free for a while, right?
00:32:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a whole different level of engagement and even relationship and concern and mutual respect and honor. And people get to prove it by how they show up not what they say to you.
00:32:20 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:32:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, let's you take some time. However long it takes you, I mean, we're not going to talk for a month, but I would love you to fill this out for everything that you're working on. Even do it retroactively for it was Tim that you worked for before, right, for a few months, or maybe that was time. This is Tim now. This is Tim now. Oh, my bad. Okay. These people with their similar names. Okay. Anyway, um, yes. So I think you should go back retroactively to anybody that you consulted with and do. You know, it's not going to be perfect because you don't have a crystal clear memory of what you did, but fall part of the best you can. And and and compare so that when you do future client work and profit partner alignments, you have a real idea of what you've been compensated before and also what you've earned. You're just going to feel different like it's going to be eyes wide open and it may actually create some resentment if this didn't already. But the good news is that is a springboard to the place where you're really happy regardless of how this market is and how many people are suffering. Plenty of people are doing really well and it's because of the people they aligned with. I just did. It was crazy. Biggest deal I've ever done. And it was the easiest thing, really, he had to take, I don't know, two or three weeks to really think about it, but it was $100,000 deal. I've never done that before. And it is almost no work. And but it's because I made him millions. it's a law firm. It's not I am. So that's a big difference. I'm working for like my, the next client was a doctor. And it's like a no brainer for him. And in one session, I got him enough traction and taught him something that I have to do the math. What's 15 times? How much was Yeah, so he's definitely got himself paid for because there was something he he was doing and it stressed him out and he hated doing it, so he just didn't do it, so I showed him how to use AI to take the friction out of it, but also because he's nerdy, it made him excited to kind of game the system. Instead of defeating him, he gained it and I was like, I don't have to work so hard. don't to stress so hard. And he enjoyed teaching the AI model how to work for him. So each one of the reports that he wasn't doing because they were tedious as a doctor. Now, he still has to prove it, right? So it's by copy-teeping versus copy-writing scenario all over again, right? So I got him out of the copy-writing and just into copy-teeping effectively with his reporting. And his manager is so happy because he always drags his feet on this. So in one week, that's how much money he was able to get. at $180,000 that he was dragging his feet on and potentially risking losing that attorney referral source because he drags his feet on it. So I potentially stay 10 just that relationship also, which we can't be quantified right now. It can be, I don't have the data for it, but it's going to be worth millions to him. Easily, it's going to be worth, because that was one month, $180,000. He keeps getting referrals, and they all need more doctors. All the attorneys need more doctors, and they need good, reliable doctors. And he's good and reliable just slow, because he hates doing it. So now, not only does he not have to deal with the stress and the friction of doing it, but he's also not going to deal with the delayed payment, and he's also not going to risk that relationship. my value, and I pointed it out to him, my bill's paid for over and over again, copy work that you did, he gets to use that copy again and again. or versions of it, right? go ahead. So that's the thing. Changing who I worked with because of it and knowing my worth and then just doing the math in front of people and making sure that they pay attention to it. So I don't and you know this because we've been doing it repeatedly. I don't assume my people are doing my math, you know, for themselves. So I make sure they do it and go, okay, you wouldn't have had this if we weren't working together. You wouldn't have had this if we weren't working together. You wouldn't have had that. It isn't about ego stroking, but it's like, we do need to know what it does that makes a difference, like tracking macros. When do you figure out that if you eat more protein, you're not hungry anymore or you sleep better or you don't crash as much? It's not until you really look at the data, but nobody's going to make you look at the data if you don't do it yourself.
00:38:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
kind of thing.
00:38:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So do this for yourself, get really clear on it and then do it with your people and say, look, this is where we're at. So just so you know, this is what I'm going for. I'm going to take us there. If I'm not compensated appropriately, when we get there, we're going to have a different conversation. I've done that and I've terminated relationships even when I had no other money coming in, Chris. And every time they try to come back and double what they would pay me and I refuse it. No, you had your chance to appreciate it. I'm going somewhere else. So these are hard conversations, but I'll tell you what, when the economy is the way it is, you've got more leverage than you think, if you're willing to pay the price of being bold. But the leverage point is having all the other conversations and potentially taking on more work than you really want to do for a little while, knowing that the deck is shifting. And that's going to be what allows you to walk away from other things and the only new things that you take on be highly leveraged.
00:39:27 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, for sure. mean, I think I've got a moment of, I haven't heard anything back from that conservative group that said they were going to be hard to email copywriters and she's been on vacation, I think she goes back today. I was going to email and check in with them, just see what was going on and then my, I had The CPA I mentioned earlier, I met him through Brian's mastermind and he was in Nashville, took me up to dinner a couple weeks ago. He's a little awkward guy and he does all of his clients are on he just does a subscription with a monthly subscription. I think he's got two different office locations like he's got a house of wine and Las Vegas and he was in for his clients he bought the the white label version of go-high level and he just gave it to them. for free is part of their subscription to him. And I said, were you selling any kind of services or build outs to your clients and go high level? And he said, no, we're just making it available as a bonus. And he said, that something you would want to do? And at dinner that night, I said, well, yeah, that interesting. And we kind of left it at that. And I didn't really pursue it because I'm like, I don't know. This guy, he's I don't know. There's just something a little strange about him, like.
00:41:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, thanks, I said, you're good, always.
00:41:49 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. But but I was thinking I was contemplating today is like, we should have reached out to him and see because I mean, it wouldn't and offer like that, like. It wouldn't be at all. As clients, it'd have to be like a specific, you know, nitched client or something that could be replicated, you know, folks in sort of the same industry. So I haven't done anything with that. It's percolating in my head, but you know, like in September, I think I want to do another be a boot camp and in that all, you know, the last one was giving me a 10 grand and we did that one.
00:42:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can I hate interrupting, but sometimes I feel like it's probably more effective to do that because I have an intuitive thoughts with the experience and the experience that you have had. I know that your intuition is very good, very, very good. Within the parameters, sometimes the intuition is just a don't do anything and sometimes we can use that just to make a very narrow scope of support contract that serves us and it's temporary. So you don't look at it as any kind of long-term potential but also there are always going to be things that you need to run through the good better best filter. You have X amount of time and high level brain energy to use each month. So to the point of if you say yes to anything this scope needs to be clearly defined, narrow and highly lucrative and highly leveraged and you can make the pitch of here's the offer take it or leave it basically. Now your energy is take it or leave it. The words are not, obviously, but you want to be very clear energetically in your heart that like, you're not attached to it. You don't care if they say yes or no. You don't think about, but I need this money because if you do that, it comes out in your energy. You need to trust that the money will come and you already have your, you've been improving the leverage and efficacy of your efforts in tight. Regardless of the fact that you should be getting more, it's still improving, not very quickly, but it is improving and your attitude and energy about it is making that leverage increase. We have been refining this process more and more and though it is small and not enough, 100%, it's a measurable increase in leverage, which is really important because It's also an increase in the compounding effect, meaning you're spending less time spinning your wheels and reactively responding to what's there in the Titan's world, do you agree with that? Yeah, for sure. so we have to trust that continuing to massage and leverage and refine what is happening there is to your best interest and that that simply takes a matter of time has to, but that we know that it has a return that it continues to improve for you because we've got other resources, other people, I mean, like where we are this year is night and day from where we were last year trying like at this time last year was when we were getting operational help and conversations. got Brian and Carla on to meetings, and you got a couple of different people helping as a result of that work, that, you know what I mean, you were so stressed out about all the emails that were happening and having to do the development work just night and day difference in a year, not night and day difference in the last six months, right? But in the year, which is why I like that as a look back, very significant and it only happened because of you. That would not have happened without you driving. You drove it, you obtained those results. So we got to take that into account. So now, I don't know how much time you have, but I don't have a hard stop.
00:46:49 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Do you have a hard stop? Yeah, I got to go pick up Madeline at 2.30.
00:46:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:46:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So I can catch up on the fee.
00:46:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. But also, you If you want to have another conversation and I won't change the fact that I'll cut the invoice in hot to really kind of refine what's happening on Titans and help you just get a little bit more clear on what you're doing. I've promised you before and I mean it now, oh, give you more time. I know that you're very capable about doing some things by yourself, but I do also think that the experience that we've had is that I really can help you figure out a way to better leverage your time and I think that it's time sensitive that we have a deeper conversation about what's on the table for you right now so that the next time that three month comes around, it's not so stressful for you. Especially because that's coming around winter, holiday, time, know, I would really like you to be better prepared for that. So, if you want to have another conversation, not next week because it's the first week of school for my girls, but the week after. I would like to have an extra call.
00:48:04 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Would you be okay with that? Yeah, yeah, that would be great.
00:48:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. All right. So yeah, let's dive into tea and then we will come back in a couple of weeks and please do feel free to use voice messages or whatever as you're contemplating things. But really, let's set the intention that the next three months, you're not stressed out like this. Let's let's meet that happen. Okay.
00:48:28 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay, Mullen. Yeah, so the, I mean, the tea is steadily moving forward. just been, it's just so slow. Like, and I know that if I was doing this, like, it'd be done and up and running and I think the, well, I'm Today, I'm supposed to get an update from their developer who is connecting ClickBank to ConvertKit. I gave him everything he needed on Friday or Monday of this week, but easy connection. mean, easy for me to say, but I feel like it's easy connection to make. So that buyer is using ConvertKit for the tea company, and so he's like, I'll have an update for you on Wednesday. so sort of my way to see if I can update today. And if I don't, then my message tomorrow is like, let's get on a call. Let's figure out like, why does that It's taken so long. And to figure out what the roadblocks are, hopefully there are no roadblocks I don't know about, that would be not great. And because the product has already been approved, in ClickBank, the sales pages are up. They're just not, it's not live on ClickBank yet. I've got all the initial email. Like everything's sitting there ready to go. And John, I think it's yesterday, John texted me, he's the elder, he's the dad. And I was just apologetic, but it was taken so long. And. So I just, I just don't know why it's taking so long.
00:51:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And this is not still the server issue?
00:51:15 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
This is not still the server issue. This is like just the crossing teas, dotting eyes, getting all the back and stuff to connect and that's probably not there. I don't know. Let's say it's not their forte. They've got this developer bin who they hand all this tech stuff off to. And so maybe it's just, and I don't know, been under a minimum. And so maybe he's just the hold up and they're not pushing him or he's not the kind of person I would hire or I don't know what it is. But yeah, it's just feeling like this. it's just taking way too long to get this offer up. But it's funny when I think about, then I spent this morning, because I wasn't feeling great this morning, and I had a headache, so I was sitting there thinking and I started making a list of what are my client options and then my brain then goes to, I start thinking about the tea, like, the thing I like about that is it's product-based, it's something that we can build, at the heart, it's really a nutrition company in the health space, which gets me excited about that. And where that can grow, we all have the, we're all thinking, eventually this is something we want to build so that we can sell it. So, but I brought that up because I was like, part of my mind today was like, well, I just started like going down these rabbit trails and Google keyword, was like, what are people searching? And then, like, the quilting niche and what are people searching for and, you know, dog training. I was just like, because I started thinking like, maybe, because I hadn't really, anyway, I was like, maybe I should be open and just kind of spend some time thinking about this and I was like, well, that's kind of what attracts me to the tea. So, I don't really have like an end point in that, it's just where my mind's been today, like I've been looking at that. these different niches and thinking that, well, I did kind of lean on one, you know, the fastest path I need some cash is probably doing some kind of client work, but anyway, I've been kind of, I've been kind of all over the place this morning. Yes, I've been off my game, well, I guess, whatever.
00:54:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, here's what I think. I think there's two things. First of all, I think we have probably about two years, because I think that we finally hit the, what happened in 2006 to 2009. I think that we're, I think we're right around the 2007 kind of numbers. it really tanked in 2008.
00:55:02 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I don't think we've hit bottom.
00:55:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't think we're at 2008 now, but it started in 2006. People really have focused on 2008, but it started happening in 2006. If I recall correctly, going through all of that, it was shifting then. Anyway, so always be thinking leveraged, and the most leveraged thing that I think that you can do is be a high-paid consultant. Now, why that's leveraged is how much time you spend doing it. You have enough connections, but here's the other thing is, you're in a situation where almost everybody is not highly leveraged, and that's the issue. don't have the kind of money to make you a highly paid consultant. So the way that you could be leveraged is having somebody that you can actually use, who is not as smart as you, might be very good and should be very skilled, but not as smart as you and aware as you in terms of being leveraged. So a lot of the contractors are not making, probably not going to be making the money that they were, because the people they were working for are losing money kind of a fist because they don't manage their business as well, and they don't manage their money well. There is going to be a shortage of client work for those middle level people who are really good at what they do, but who don't have a marketing engine to get them new clients and who are losing clients because their clients can't be. So what I think that, and this is going to be like we've talked about rolling up your sleeves, and you've been there for a while, but It feels different when you have somebody else to riff with and to work with. I think what you should be figuring out is, and to me, I think Chris, one of your most powerful and valuable skills is offer creation. The hook and the offer is high level strategy, but then most people don't have the fulfillment team to write that copy, write the email, write the sales pages, write the follow-up sequences, and that actually is not as valuable, but it is necessary to offer creation. Most people don't have the brain for the offer creation that can write copy pretty well. Okay, and they don't have the co-honies to say, hey, this is what you should be doing, and here's why, and they won't do to do the math, but they can write the persuasive copy. So what I think that you should do, and this will take a little bit of time because you gotta find the right person, but I think that you should focus on a consulting gig that makes you a minimum of $100 to $150 per hour, effective hourly rate based off your number, and that might change after you go plug everything in. And then what you do is you price it accordingly, and then you go hire a copywriter to help create your vision that you copy chief, again, trying to focus on that effective hourly rate, being an increase of what you've already been doing. So that way mentally you're like, yes, I'm working more, but I have raised my value and I can see it. So that level of satisfaction, and basically what you're doing is removing that friction and that resistance that's been stressing you out of I could be doing better. because now you know you are doing better. Does that make sense? Yeah. So I know you got to go, but what I want you to do, and let's revisit this. Again, we don't have to wait until we meet. can have these conversations, okay? Look for some consulting jobs where they need help with offer creation and leveraging their business so that they're not bleeding money and they're getting the most out of what they already have, right? Repurposing things, improving their offers, their leverage. Nobody's talking about leverage, really, you know that. But that's the saving grace for us in these hard times, is leverage. So create leverage, and then you go leverage somebody else's writing skills and ability, or even chat GPT and train it well, but focus on leverage because that's the thing that's going to keep you, especially in this third month. people from stressing out. We need to talk more. You've got a lot on your plate. Use me. This is my genius zone and I want to use it for you. I don't want the third month to be stressful for you. There's no need for it. You've got too much value and too much that you bring to the table to ever feel that again, no matter what the economy is. Okay.
01:00:26 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
All right.
01:00:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I fixed the invoice. don't know if you saw a screen share. I didn't realize I was in paper. I adjusted it. I sent a schedule for it to me in two weeks. Please talk to me more. Let's make sure we get you through and then ready so that the stress month doesn't ever come again. There's no reason for it, Chris. You're very good at what you do. You make money. There is still money out there. We just need to get you correctly aligned and leverage. bridging other people.
01:01:03 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, that makes sense. I'm bored with that.
01:01:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's all there. You've done we've talked about the community and your network for a long time. You are primed for this. We're just going to need there's going to be one other talent person that we need to figure out. So ponder on that. And we'll we'll find it. But but you're in a good spot. Still, we just need to use it better.
01:01:30 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's all. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I mean, it's a it's a better third month than the last third month.
01:01:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But definitely the next one's going to be better. That's what we're going do. We're going to make the lows higher and the highs higher. That's the improvement. Awesome. Okay, it's always good to talk to you. Let's keep talking.

Hi, this is going to say good morning, it's not morning, though. How are you?
00:00:17 - Lorenz Schuerch
Pretty good. How are you?
00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. Got you Patrick in here.
00:00:27 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Hello.
00:00:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have your chicken breast for lunch today?
00:00:33 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I did eat the chicken first today.
00:00:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's the whole thing.
00:00:38 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
wasn't. It's a bar, so it helps.
00:00:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're Lauren's one of the meetings that was just me and Patrick were talking about having to do one of the exercises that I recommend. And I was like, is there any habit that you have that you do just because you know it's good for you? you really hate it and he's like yeah eating chicken breast and I was like yeah I get that.
00:01:07 - Lorenz Schuerch
There's only so many ways you can make chicken breast look taste good and none of them are healthy so.
00:01:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right and then you defeat the purpose of having chicken breast and you're like but spices man learning how to use spices will change the game and the type of cooking that you I've learned that. I also don't have the energy for that so I can't be bothered. All right let's see let me get open my notes. So I have this combined. I do need to have a separate one for you guys. I got way too many times going on. How's your guys this week Ben?
00:01:59 - Lorenz Schuerch
Very good. Yeah. Pretty busy.
00:02:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, um, have we had any contemplation about schedule and organization and goals and since we last spoke?
00:02:19 - Lorenz Schuerch
I mean, yeah, I kind of know I want to organize the teams when I have those absences coming up, come up. But yeah, having one less team member every month, you know, that stresses everyone out. So there's things that are that could have a potential for falling through the cracks. So that's a little stressful, but we're making it happen.
00:02:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. so trying to think, oh, you sent me. Let me go open your email. Last week it was just you and me, right, Lawrence?
00:03:09 - Lorenz Schuerch
Not as you, Patrick.
00:03:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Me and Patrick, okay. I'm just going to tell you right now. I'm still dealing with this early morning seminary and it is not working for me. The opposite is happening. It's not that I just can't get up. I'm waking up at three o'clock in the morning randomly and can't go back to sleep with the crap. I can't. Hey, sorry.
00:03:32 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, my kids go to school on the other side of town. So I have to get up at 5.30, so I feel your pain.
00:03:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Oh my gosh. Wait, this is ridiculous. Okay, open this. So intake. I'm gonna. Dang it. You guys in this Microsoft stuff. Friends, can you please copy the document that you sent me? Anatomy of the case and just put it into an email. And I can. And copy and paste it and put it into a spreadsheet. Because I don't want to deal with trying to log into Microsoft. Actually, I probably can do this. I don't And that was finished with the last time.
00:04:14 - Lorenz Schuerch
So you should have next couple of seconds here.
00:04:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. And where's the one that I was working with Patrick? I have so many sweet ones for the cheese. Surveys. Oh my gosh, I forgot to put the door and those birds are going bonkers. Can you hear that?
00:04:47 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yes.
00:04:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My child has got these two parakeets and they're quiet except for when she's gone. They're like, yeah, we're going to fight. So it's nobody here to tell us to behave. right, waiting for that to come back through again. There we go. All right. the heck did I put the one that you and I were working on? Patrick. I'm going to move over this here. Oh, I forgot how that pastes. We spent the whole time doing that last time through our progress budget. Patrick team tasks. That's what it was. I'm going to paste Lorenz's stuff on a new tab. Actually, let me go look and let it fire real quick. I did it. I have to set a reminder because we have one person that creates these reports for us. I figured out what I can get for you guys as a report that you can look at, but it has to be created. I All right. All right. We'll get everybody set real quick. Okay. Those are so quiet.
00:06:45 - Lorenz Schuerch
We're the literally the two quietest guys in the hole for.
00:06:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You were with the light chatty is chatter box ever and then you're just quiet and Mike. I like talking, but I don't. only talking to myself or necessarily listening to myself. I'm just like, feel like I'm monologuing over here. I am monologuing over here. Do you need another teens? Okay, let's take a look at this. What? 30 days, refreshed. I'm 24. So somebody has already looked at this today. Um, dropouts and subouts by team. How many cases do you have right now, Patrick? Because you've got a lot moved over.
00:07:42 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
165.
00:07:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, it's about same as I was last week, I think. Um, record count. Let's see. Drop down, set down, total list. I want to look at it by let's see, I know what I'm not supposed to show and that is not in this room.
00:08:28 - Lorenz Schuerch
Why are you not supposed to That's not in your business.
00:08:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, what is it? it to you, why are you asking me? Don't play me like nice stupid geez. You're gonna get one by me. I don't think so! How you met Ronan?
00:08:50 - Lorenz Schuerch
The dog? dog? well I've seen him on camera.
00:08:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's so cute. I randomly get Ronan pictures sometimes. It's just probably awesome. Let's see. Where's the report report? That was after that. Now I'm Okay, this is good. I can do this. I can share screen. Okay, so this is just the last 30 days, which we know is a terrible type of snapshot. That's longer. So we're gonna go look at the last 90 days. That would be We. And also, Patrick is still new and it doesn't even have an average case load, normal case load. Okay, average resolution speed by team over the last 90 days, that gap is closing pretty good. So it's a roughly a 15-day gap between you and Samantha Lorenz. I know how Tyler's is faster. I guess he's better than I think that he is. I don't know.
00:10:30 - Lorenz Schuerch
I have to work him up as much.
00:10:32 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, is that necessarily a good thing if it's that?
00:10:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm not trying to stir the pop because I just all like things sometimes, but I'm not that good at thinking about things. just blurt.
00:10:49 - Lorenz Schuerch
No, but I do agree that faster is one thing if you're getting full policy limits on them, but let's look at that.
00:10:58 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I think closing that on a week.
00:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, he's pretty high on that too, but this average fee per attorney, that is much lower and not an issue. Nate doesn't count because he's litigation. Yeah, and then cases closed while again we're going with speed rather than quality. This is really probably the bigger indicator. I mean, this is pretty big getting. I wonder how that even happens if that's just look at the draw, but I don't. This doesn't seem like an accurate correlation. I need to. Let's think, you know, I don't know where my snuffing notes are. I'll just send her an email. The blue is less than 40%, right?
00:12:13 - Lorenz Schuerch
My blue is 40%.
00:12:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh! I have the brain. You're right. Good job. Good call. eyes. Good looking out. Okay. Way better. So he's less than that. Okay. That seems more right. Do you guys know how hard it is to find attorneys to hire? It's hard. This is a very long time. Just something to put under your cap. Should you ever need that information that you didn't hear from me?
00:12:52 - Lorenz Schuerch
Okay.
00:12:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got a problem on people's. Okay. So anyway. Um. Okay. Um. We will get a version of the report that for sure you can look at and it really should have all of these things just that some things are connected to other things. And, uh, you know, it's an entire business and running a business has different level of responsibility and that information is important. So to the point of like, what is it? Don't worry about it. You want that responsibility. You can open your own practice. It's a lot. It's a lot to run the business. I'll tell you. All right, I'll put some subouts by team. So I wish that this was separated. I really need dropout and subouts because they're very different, right?
00:13:45 - Lorenz Schuerch
Right. don't want to hang on to cases for too long, right? If they're not, if you find out that they're not viable.
00:13:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so drop out and then subout means to be separated. And then also validate, you know, it's probably the right correlation for the twice between. Oh, actually, I want, let's see. I need a number. For. Below. 3% and. Above 40% or 4% higher. Save. Okay. Okay.
00:14:52 - Lorenz Schuerch
What's other.
00:14:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know. That's what I need. Wait, where's the other. Oh. Oh. Okay, I don't, I don't know, um, dropouts. And so dropouts, as you got rid of the case, right? You just like, I referred it out, referred out, right?
00:15:17 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah.
00:15:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And stuff out is they went somewhere else. So maybe other is like, it shouldn't have been a retainer in the first place, because they already had an attorney, or the case was closed and it already been settled, and they came in and they were trying to like, do it again to see if they could get better results, because I've heard that that happens, or that they know, because that would be, yeah, is so if they had waited too long, didn't have any insurance, Like, are there different qualifications where you wouldn't refer it out, you just need to go, this is not a viable case?
00:16:07 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, that's when we drop it, you know, like there's no insurance to go after, or there's...
00:16:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, then maybe other is referred out.
00:16:15 - Lorenz Schuerch
Okay.
00:16:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that those are the three categories, either it's just, it's not a viable case. They went somewhere out, or we referred them out. And we want to track them, because referred out is still some source of revenue, dropped things. wasted time and we wasted money. And so we need to track that, because that's potentially an intake issue. So anyway, which is something that we're also working on. Intake is really, it's a whole different process. And I've been working really hard to try to get more attention onto the intake. Process, because it's not super effective. And I'm saying that because... As you can tell, all of us have work to do. All of us could do things better. We could all be more optimized, like we show up and we get a job done. But the job can always be done better without necessarily like brow beating and trying to be a perfectionist. all the things that we're doing are not really perfectionism type stuff, right? It's not about never make this mistake, never do that, never do this. It's more about sorting the tasks and using the time better and paying attention to specific types of things, prioritizing, valuing, things like that, versus always do this, never do that, blah, that type of thing. So anyway, but if we can improve the intake process, and a good portion of that is the way people show up on the calls, like the clients themselves. So some of them are liars. I don't know a portion of them, some of them liars, but most of them have never been in a car accident before. Don't what to do. So this is a new experience. They don't know you. They don't trust you necessarily, right? And they don't know what they need to communicate to you. So if the questions aren't asked at all, or if they're not asked clearly, you know, there's, there's so much nuance to that. And we've talked about call control, even on the attorney level, when you're dealing with the clients, trying to figure out how to keep a person who's not good at communicating, or not articulate, not focused, not willing. Like your people have to be able to extract specific types of information from people who it may be just really difficult to extract from them because they lack the vocabulary, lack the coherence, they lack the the interest, all of these types of things. So it's not as simple as here's a script, follow this script, and it's going to be perfect every time, because you're like, have you, I mean, I know you have Lorenz, but has anybody ever tried to put clothes on, baby?
00:19:21 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, it's really hard.
00:19:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's really hard. The baby will do what the baby wants to do. It's not just like, hey, get dressed. let me put your arm in here, put your legs in here. like, no, I don't want to do that. Yeah, it's, it can be like that probably talking to clients like, look, I'm just trying to help you. And they're like, oh, no, don't want to do that. Anyway, yeah. So that's what we're dealing with is we don't have this perfect hygienic, hygienic, what's the word, like, pristine, there's a goal. Yes, something like that, you know. like like Intel has this it's pristine like but that's not the word I'm looking for environment where they make the um the processors but anyway that's just like this this perfect environment that is that works the same every single time so you get the same kind of output every single time that's not what you're dealing with you're dealing with people people at every point a different person at the insurance agency a different doctor a different um client a different person on intake who took the report like there are so many different things that and that can affect how it goes and like you guys we're different people every day so um you've experienced many different versions of Tina so far it's like tired cranky hungry wait that's me all the time maybe I'm gonna say anyway um but but if people are run down if their brains aren't working and optimized there's all kinds of different things go into here. So it doesn't make any sense to say, this is the way to do it every single time, just do this, and you'll get perfect results. you have to do, first of all, is teach everybody to be able to think critically, who you're talking to, what are you dealing with, what do you recognize about the situation that you've come into contact with before, what are the treatments that you can apply, so like if you've got somebody who is hesitant, resistant to share information with you, then one of the things that you want to do is remind them why they're calling in the first place, why you're talking to them in the first place. They've been in a car accident, there's been some injury, and they want to get the help and they don't want to pay for it. The only way they're going to get that outcome is to be able to work with you, and the only way that you can be successful in helping them accomplish that outcome is by telling you what you need to know. But I guarantee you most of the time that conversation isn't had so explicitly. So those are the types of things that we want to be aware of is what are the different ways that we can communicate and operate to get us the best outcome no matter who we're talking to and what the situation is. And in order for you all to learn how to do that and for your teams to learn how to do that through you, you have to be able to learn to evaluate all these moving parts because all of these moving parts have an impact in the overall outcome, which is what your client is interested in, right? So anyway, so now we're looking at these types of things. Let's go ahead and get to zoom on my way. I think it's, it is not that one, it's this one. Okay, so we're on I'm going to show you what Patrick and I were done before we get to your stuff that you shared with me. So, you know what I forgot to do is get a drink. There's nobody in my house to go fetch it for me, food, whatever. Okay, so these are the breakdowns of the types of tasks that Patrick could identify in the case process, which will go and compare to yours. And then I asked him to tell me who does it, and then what we did was we looked at the different stages that these things are in and which things can be done simultaneously, meaning not necessarily like one person doing it, but you don't it's not contingent upon another thing to be accomplished. So, if we're waiting for one thing, we can be working on the other thing. So the introduction call confirming the coverages and liability, liability that over there. Order initial documents such as police reports, hospital records, health insurance liens, sending defendant insurance inquiries, requests for D&B insurance search requests, order policy limits. I'm just going to keep going. Oh, I got to move that. Continuing client medical referrals, whatever, can read the rest of it. So what we found here, so obviously introduction call happens first, right? There's a chronological order to some of these things and a dependency upon previous tasks in some of these. So you can't have this stage, right, until you've had the introduction call. You can't order the initial documents, you're not going to do that until you've confirmed the coverages and liability. And then sending And the defendant, the insurance inquiry request DMV, obviously there's there's some dependencies here. So now what we have here and down here set up for treatment is this whole group of activities that can be done without having to just wait for this to happen or wait for that to happen. So that's good to know because when we're looking at the timeline and we're reviewing the cases and looking at what can be moved forward. Let's say this isn't done or this is done and this is done and this is done, but this isn't. We can be working on these things. So what Patrick and I did last week also is we went into Lidify and looked at just all of the cases that he had open. Now, we only got like two cases in and there was one that hadn't been touched for. Three months and one that hadn't been touched for two months. And so one of them was clearly that person was in treatment and the other one was probably that, but there was a little, there was a question mark about it. But here's the thing, even if we know that they're in treatment, you've got, and this is something I explained to Patrick, you've got a person on the other end who their experience, and this is going to come out in their reviews, and this is going to also impact how they feel when you get to do the distributions conversation. You've got this person depending upon their attorney, and they want to feel like they're cared about, that they're known, that they're remembered, and that they matter, that they're not just a paycheck. So if I don't hear from somebody for six months, three months, you know, I'm like, what's going on with my case? Even if they told me that these are all the things that have to happen, there's something that clicks if somebody's just like, hey, just want to check in on you, want to make sure that your treatments are going well, see if you have any questions, and just let you know just a reminder this is where we're at with the case. There's nothing that we can do until you treatment. And so there's really no need for you to do anything, but just want to let you know that and just want to make sure that everything's okay. Can you imagine what that feels like when your attorney's office calls you like that. Now imagine you're like a lonely old lady that got in a car wreck or a cranky old dude and nobody's cared about you because you grew up hard and there's you know what I mean? Like there's a there's a lot to be said for nurture and concern, and you're already in the habit of talking to people very frequently. That's not a lot of time, especially. If you don't really actually have to ask them anything you and you could pick somebody on your team who's really good at this both of you have people that well I don't know about you so much Patrick I don't but I would assume so have people that your clients like talking to we don't want to spend too much time with this but you do you know like you could you can kind of deputize somebody on the team to do these follow ups that really aren't only just to let them know we haven't forgotten you. So I don't think anybody should go longer than a month without being followed up with even if we're in treatment and we know that the treatment is going to take six months because there's this whole long thing of they're supposed to go to 20 chiropractors visits and it's going to take however long you know what I mean. Even if you do the math and you know there's no way they're going to be done in a month. Checking on them within a month just let them know hey we're going to follow up with you check on you see how you're doing and then actually do it. There's this whole psychological thing. that happens with people. That's like, first of all, you set an expectation. Second of all, you met that expectation. I'm going to feel like when you tell me you're going to do something, I can count on that. And also, when we get to the distributions conversation, I'm like, I feel a little bit differently because you reached out to me, you checked on me. And honestly, like, I felt like I was just kind of going through this alone. I'm stuck in the middle of this. My back is hurting. My neck is hurting. I'm not going to get paid for a while. I have to go through this stuff and nobody cares. But my turn is called and checked on me. That was like, I was good. I needed that. Not even a tiny little thing. So the other thing that we talked about Lorenz is doing a top to bottom file review once a week, all of your cases. But I'm not talking about going into every type of detail that you guys do. I think as a team, all we did was open up the cases. Um, just looked at the conversation and the notes to see how long it had been since anybody had contacted them. And if there was a very apparent somebody should have said something either because of the time that had gone by it exceeded, you know, a month or something like that, or there was a lack of clarity in the update in the notes and the conversation, right? Somebody said, I'm going to do this, but there's no clear evidence that it was done or that it's being done or that there's any issue or any success, you know what I mean? So it would take you, you know, with the amount of cases, you have how many open cases do you have, you know, uh, two, forty, three, I think. Yeah. So you probably have about a hundred and more. Wait, what did you tell me Patrick? I have I know your volume changed.
00:31:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
165. Yeah, so that's my total. don't know what's open.
00:31:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, wait a minute. Total meaning all the cases you've ever done or ever currently have on my list, but I think open means like not settled, I think. Oh, okay.
00:31:23 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, I consider a settled cases until they're closed to be active because there's still work to be done on me.
00:31:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:31:32 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Me too. So it could be done.
00:31:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
have some 165. Yeah. So to me, uh, yeah, when I stay open, that's what I mean is that it hasn't been, you haven't received payment. Basically when you receive payment, it's that's done, but I might be incorrect on the verbiage.
00:31:51 - Lorenz Schuerch
So I'm down to 230 now.
00:31:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:31:57 - Lorenz Schuerch
Isn't it? the two, Hank.
00:31:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, Probably some of it, but also leads have dropped tremendously this month. It has slowed way down. We are about 65% of volume from last month, so there's that. But there have been some cases gone to Hank, but not. I mean, I actually know. I don't even think he's in this report. So yeah, yes. Those only resolutions. I'd have to go on, I don't know if I need to share, I'm sure. guess that would probably be okay. But just because I don't know what the report will show up, I will look at that later and see how many he's got. Anyway, was I up?
00:32:58 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Going through the file reviews.
00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, yeah, thank you for being a teacher, Patrick, good job. So anyway, Lorenz, what I was asking Patrick to do and I would like you to do this as well is just that. Just take and it will go much faster as you do it every week. But just open them and see when was the last time that that client has heard from somebody from Sweetlaw and unless you get distracted and turn it into something else, it shouldn't take probably more than a couple of hours. And once you do it the next week, there will be some of them and maybe you have a way of marking them where you can just go, I sure don't need to check that because number one, I know they're in treatment and number two, it's only been a week since somebody checked on them so I don't have to look at that. But is that something that you would be willing to do?
00:33:55 - Lorenz Schuerch
Well, yeah, I thought it was something that I thought the... Can you click on your matters that already voted that last call? Yeah.
00:34:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if you click on that, um, can you, could you share your screen and show me what you look at?
00:34:24 - Lorenz Schuerch
Okay, go. can you see my cursor?
00:34:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
00:34:40 - Lorenz Schuerch
Right here.
00:34:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh. Okay. Now, let's see how many cases you let's, let's just go scroll all the way through, but okay. So, okay, let's pause. All right, so, what I want you to do is validate this, can we just pick a couple of cases randomly, two, whatever, and look at that and make sure that that is correct?
00:35:22 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, so this one's supposed be 9-3 for the last so I'm to mute this last one, September 3, like that, we love the call, the client, by the client list, we all
00:36:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hold on, so was there anything that was supposed to happen after that? So here's what I want to know. Because we're trying to improve the overall length of time to resolve a case, right? if you ask a person to do something, statistically, how often are people going to do most of those things? Most people going to do those things quickly.
00:36:35 - Lorenz Schuerch
That's your experience? Oh, I don't know, Tina, couple of months I've had people gone for two weeks at a time, so it's everyone's been a little bit swamped. I kind of get, I have to use my dad voice with John this morning for letting a few things fall through the cracks, but honestly, he's been handling the caseload without Barry for three weeks now.
00:37:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So now I was just trying to imagine Lawrence's dad voice to apply the model. So most people, I think, if you ask them to do something, unless it's urgent for them, they're not necessarily going to do that quickly.
00:37:31 - Lorenz Schuerch
So So how often do you follow up with them without like being this type of thing?
00:37:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If it's a move something forward, I'd do it weekly. And I would just do a quick text message. You're like, Hey, just wanted to check and make sure that you did that. And how's it going? Or were there any issues, whatever, you get a response back and they're like, Oh, just be like, okay, just wanted to check. Because we definitely want to get that check to you, know, something like that, or you're just kind of nudging matter of fact. There's a great book. That's right. I don't remember who I thought I can do for a minute. It's called nudge. Um, but it's basically that we all need nudges. We all need nudges for different reasons, but a lot of times it's simply because something isn't top of mind. But not being top of mind doesn't mean not important and not a priority. It just means it's not top of mind, especially these days with all of the different things that we have going. And here's what I want you to think about. And we're going back to just kind of when we get down to distributions. Distributions are going to be impacted by how I feel about you. I don't know there's different people, right? Not everybody is going to feel this way, but a lot of people. There's this there's this law of reciprocity that is if you take care of me. I don't want to do bad things to you, right? So if you were helpful to me, I am not going to get upset about you earning your fee. There are different ways that we can improve the perception of our value in service towards us. Most of it is going to have to do with their sense of feeling about how we care, as well as efficiency. And there are a few little things that we can do that don't take a lot of time and requirements and energy from us, but require us to be consistent in doing that. One of them is a nudge. It's hate, just a reminder. know you're busy. You probably just want to make sure that you've got this done and that everything's going OK and see if you need any help. Now, what they don't know is that the whole reason that you're doing it is that I don't know what percentage of the case is slowed down by. clients not doing their part, but it's going to be significant. You can only control how fast you can go. You cannot control how fast the insurance company goes, but you can influence it to a degree by your tenacity and follow-up, right? You'll have even a greater impact at improving the and influencing the pace of the client doing their steps to move through it with little nudges, just wanted to check, make sure everything's okay, and then when we get down to the case, and they're kind of reviewing in the back of their mind how this experience went, man, they were always there like helping me get through the process, making sure I didn't forget anything, seeing if I was okay. You don't have to increase a lot of your time and effort to do that because most of and do you guys happen to? to mark or signify and type away when your client has a preference between text and calls.
00:41:12 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
We usually just write it on that left side.
00:41:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so you, it is something that you guys consider.
00:41:20 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I've only had like two that are like, call me, don't text me.
00:41:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. That doesn't necessarily answer my question.
00:41:30 - Lorenz Schuerch
So your question is, is there a system? Does a system have a way to differentiate between contact through text or contact through calling?
00:41:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not only does system in terms of litify, but does system in terms of your team and your operations style?
00:41:53 - Lorenz Schuerch
Well, I think Mark's made it pretty clear that he prefers texts.
00:41:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I did not know that.
00:42:00 - Lorenz Schuerch
it's good. And the problem is my experience in Arizona, clients definitely do not prefer text. There's a heavy lean towards phone calls, especially for Hispanic clients and our older population, which is a lot of Arizona rises.
00:42:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. So that's something I want to work on a little bit. But let's just assume that we can accomplish most of these nudges through text. So I'll give you the promise of the book. And it's basically a lot of the books are... Anecdotes reports stories that support the claim and basically it's that psychologically most of us need nudges. There comes up some type of resistance for different reasons and it could just be number one it's not on my mind and that happens frequently because we have so many things distracting us. Number two it could be I'm not in the mood for that. Number three it could be I don't have that number available to me at this particular moment. All kinds of different things. So a nudge could be number one it serves as a reminder. Number two the energy of the nudge right the reminder message could be such that it's encouraging and hey just wanted to check on you all they care about me out. I want to do my part I want to make sure that this case gets done I'm gonna go do it again it's not gonna work like that with everybody but The point of all the things that we're doing isn't to perfect everything, it's to improve what can be improved, right? And then to get the compounding effect of those improvements. So coming into something like this, if you look at your case and the last note that was there was, I asked the client to do something three weeks ago and there's no update. Does it matter, do we want to know that they've even gotten into a body shop and a repair we do? Because like in my area, so I got the wreck because the lady just ran it to me, sorry Jesus, it took six weeks, my car was in the shop for six weeks. And I wasn't even being neglected, I live in a small town, I was a dude from high school, you
00:45:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
who's giving any text messages and updates.
00:45:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We just don't have enough people to get the jobs done quickly and efficiently. So if we spend three weeks waiting, I'm going wait for Patrick for a minute.
00:45:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. I haven't met Mary yet.
00:45:45 - Lorenz Schuerch
Sorry.
00:45:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
haven't never met Mary yet. Anyway, okay, so. Or is that okay so if it takes like I was saying from. my car took six weeks for them to get done in the body shop. If we're waiting three weeks for them just to even make that phone call and choose a shop, you know, three weeks there, then six weeks, like we can't wrap this case up. That's a big bottleneck. So we want to at least every week be trying to make sure, hey, did you remember to call that and get between drivability? They maybe hesitant to get that done, but you are held to metrics and stats, right? Sweet law doesn't get paid until the case gets closed. It is on you to get the case closed. So to me, there's no reason if something is in the hands of someone else, for you to not be nudging it ever week going, can we move this along? Obviously not with that tone. Like, hey, just want to do. Remind you can't remove this a lot. You know, that's what's really happening. Anyway, so this is what I would like you guys to be doing and you can deputize people on your team. You can use your resources, but at the end of the day, do not do not abdicate this. So it's your job to make sure it's getting done. If you want to assign somebody to check on it and make sure that everything is being touched, do that, but then you come in and you do an audit. So you you check, you know, maybe 20% of your cases and make sure that everything that you look at is falling under the expectations that you have set, which is nobody is not getting responded to within a month. So if you know they're in treatment, there is nothing else that can be accomplished other than them completing treatment. We're just checking them once a month just so that they know we haven't forgotten them. We want to make sure everything's okay. Anything else, if we're waiting for anybody to be doing anything, we're not doing it whether it's the clients or the insurance company or whatever to make sure that that's getting done no less than once a week. Which means like because Lorenz you had gotten to a thorough file review but it took you about three weeks to get through all of your files. What I'm telling you that is that if you this process alone and you should have enough understanding of the base off of the improvement that you got when you changed your file review process. If you go through everything at the bottom once a week, not necessarily quite as thoroughly as you have been doing right with all the team but just looking at it and making sure that the movement is happening, I pretty much guarantee you that your days to close is going to decrease. Significantly and fairly quickly meaning if we go look at it weeks like a month from now There should be a few days shaved off of Maybe it's not quite that fast. I don't know because you are still impacted by other people's timing outside of your team And you can only manage your team But for sure, there's going to be an improvement so that's what I would like you guys both to do and I just want to keep having these conversations as you come back and say What did you notice like what is the frequency? How many cases did you come across and I would love you to take a little note so that we can look at how it is now and Then maybe look at it 90 days from now and go Okay, I'm coming across a lot less that weren't actually getting touched and it seems like things are going faster I'd also be very interested to know and I would love for you guys to kind of note this too Does there seem to be any type of feeling change in your team? And in their experience with Pete as they turn into somebody who's not just, okay, I've got a case to close, but a person who now nudges, and nudges a gentle work, right? It's not a push and shove and coerce. It's a, you know, you think of nudging, nudging is kind of a close, intimate thing. Like I could shove somebody, I don't like, I don't have to get, like that contact is different. You nudge somebody, you don't, you don't nudge somebody you don't like, you like, or don't know, generally. You're nudging somebody you know a little bit, you're close to like, hey, just want to get you going where you got to go, right?
00:50:42 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yes, no. You're alive, I love you. I'm just trying to picture in my head how, because I'm a, I can nudge, but sometimes I'm not that gentle, so I'm trying to.
00:50:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are you to? you even know? I know you, I understand that. So, it takes practice. I mean, I got Portuguese, I got African, I got all kinds of angry people in me that like to drink alcohol and fight, and I'm a Virgo, and I'm a firstborn girl. They'd soccer for 11 years, coached it for five years. I'm telling you, I understand these things. But, you can learn how, and it really is a great thing to learn how to do, to nudge. So, the way to do it is to know what matters to the person you're trying to nudge. What is their value? And that's the conversation we've had, right? Their value is, I want to be done with this. I don't want to hurt anymore. You can't control that, that you can help them, make sure they get a provider, and they are getting taken care of, and that their insurance policy is covering it. So, you can help with that. And, they want to get, make sure that the payment comes through, so that stuff is taken care of. They don't have to worry about the financial burden and they probably don't want to spend any of their time doing this, which means as soon as the case gets closer, sooner they can stop thinking about it. So rather than it being about, we need to get this done and I want you to get this done, it's just a reminder. I know you want this case done, of course they do, right, even if they didn't tell you. I know you don't want to be dealing with this. I know you've got better things to do and I know that you want to make sure that you get as much help as you can and that's what your insurance is for, right? So I'm here for that. So the best way to make this happen is to keep it going and keep the momentum as much as we can. So here's what I need you to do. Now, that feels like a lot of words. There's a reason I talk as much as I do. Well, there's a couple of them, number one, I'm just that way. But too, is that I've actually learns and it's one of the reasons I talk fast because nobody wants to hear all of it, but they need to. I can, I know what people need to hear and so I make sure they hear it quickly in and out. This is what you need to know to do the thing that you need to do. You will understand it like if you think about it, the majority of our conversation is why you should do what you need to do. This much of it is here's what you need to do and this much of it is how you need to do what you do. Most of it is spent on why you need to do what you need to do and the reason is if people are not bought into that recommendation, right? They don't do it. You're not, they're hand holding you're they're watching them. They're not going to do it. Even if they called you because they've got this case to solve in the first place. For example, how many people know that in order to feel better, they need to eat better and they need to exercise. Everybody knows that, right? How many people want to feel better? Everybody, probably. How many people do the thing that they could do right there in their own house to feel better? Make that much, maybe? That's my point. So you got to remember that you're talking to people who know what they need to do and probably aren't going to do it in a timely manner. On your team, the clients, the insurance companies, and that is in your way of your goals all the time. What you want to show them is how it's in the way of their own goals. Also, does that make sense? So, first you increase their awareness. You continue to keep them aware nudges and then you just support them and encourage them and direct them and small little steps. Okay. This is this is your one job. Go call the auto body shop. I'll check in with you next week. By the way, that's another thing that you can do set an expectation. I'm going to check in with you next week. Guess what you just did. I don't want to talk to this dude again. I better get it done. There are a lot of people who are just trained because the institutions of school and work create us to be this way that if somebody tells us to do something and they telling us that they're going to check up on us, I'm going to do the thing. That is most people. Most people are the institutional people. So you can tap into that knowledge and that psychology by setting the expectation. to know here's what we're going to do. I need you to buy in right? This is you want to get this case done. Okay, so now you're accountable to me and to you because I'm going to follow up with you next week. And now I've implied that I'm going to spend more time on you making sure that this is getting done and thanks to I guess the institution. We expect them to comply into the job. So there's a benefit to understanding a little bit about psychology and and using it to your benefit. Now it does increase I don't think it actually increases the workload. I'll tell you why. I think that when you realize that, okay, so there's there's different types of work that we have to do, right? There's mental work, there's energetic work, there's physical work. Um, and all of those are loads on us. So let's say I talk talk to a really terrible person for two minutes, physically, time-wise, that's not a heavy load. Energetically, that could mess me up for the whole day, right? Now, let's say I talk to a really nice person, but they yap my ear off for an hour. That's a lot of time that has an impact energetically as well, because at some point I'm going, I'm not able to get to the rest of my work. A really nice person still impacted me in a negative way, because I didn't manage the time well, and you know what I mean? So there's all kinds of different ways that this can happen. So what you want to do is look at all the potential friction points and bottlenecks that can keep you from getting to your goal and understand how to prevent them by a particular type of handling or massaging in this situation. So one of them is frequent touches, which means, for example, let's say I don't talk to somebody for six weeks and the place that I left them was they're supposed to get a hold of the body shop. Well, six weeks later I found out they've called three or six different body shops in town. Nobody can get to them for like six months and really what they needed to hear was making an appointment anyway because now you're six weeks down the road and you're still six weeks further. You're 12 weeks away from getting it done because you didn't get the job done because you were annoyed by the fact that you have to wait longer than you want to wait and all they needed was somebody to remind them like it's futile just do the thing. Like have you ever just been in a situation where you needed somebody to tell you it's not going to get better just do it? I do. I know it. I know there are things that I just know and I just want it to be a different way because it's so stupid and then somebody's like just do it because you can't process. This is leadership, you know, it's it's stewardship, it's understanding the nuance of everything in the job, including the psychology, like the mental processes of your clients, of your team, potentially even of the insurance companies that you're dealing with, although those people are just like brick wall sometimes brick wall robots are like, this is our proudest thing. This is what we have to do. I'm not annoyed by people. But sometimes you can crack a hole and those like hard people. You can just talk in the depth, guess how I know that. Yeah, okay, still the runs. Did I? I want to share this with you because I'm going to make it you do this. Hi. Share, share, share, um, with, and, and, okay, so what I want you to do around, and I'm gonna, yes, and hold on, share anyway, let me show my screen, do, I know we're over time, sorry. Okay, so what I would like you to do is kind of format your data into something like what I did over here. This wasn't what Patrick did, this is what I set up, and I think Patrick, I gave you an assignment, but I didn't share this with you, so you couldn't have accomplished it, which is see if you can fill this section out, phases and time estimated to complete. Now, a range, this is gonna be a range of time, obviously, right, um, there, there's not gonna be a set. This should definitely be done in this amount of time, but, but give us a range to the best of ability and Lorenz, I want you to so I'm thinking that you Should really have similar stuff.
01:02:17 - Lorenz Schuerch
You do not need to change your language, but ultimately we want to have kind of Patricks Yeah, if that works for you, you totally can I mean I It seems like it would save a lot of time. I can just edit As I see fit, but I can just use Patrick as a base and change the names and Yeah, so you can um, I'm gonna make this pad right Seems like it's pretty similar to what I came up with So I'm gonna do this.
01:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it does seem very similar. I'm gonna Don't don't whoa. What the heck that is not how that works It's so weird, you know what, if I go like this, let's try that one more time. If you go crazy on me, okay, so we'll call this Lorenz. And then that out, you can, we're gonna take this off, you can go look at a reference. I would like this info on your team too. And then, so both of you, so Patrick, fill out these things the best that you can feel free to collaborate with each other. will do that anyway as we work together. And then, let's see, if there is, let's see, if there's an action to be performed, the case should be the client, I guess, will be contacted less. that once a week, okay? Thoughts, comments, concerns? Annoyances, completes?
01:04:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Well, Lorenzo, if there's like extra stuff that you added, try and keep it in because I also want to see, or maybe I could just look at what you said there.
01:04:24 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, and notice you have more, you're more detailed on the case opening stuff. I might have added more items like...
01:04:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is what Lorenzo had, information gathering, get RA, get signed RA intake, attorney intro, like there are some more nuance to what you shared.
01:04:51 - Lorenz Schuerch
I'll be doing a treatment of that too.
01:04:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so and you guys can work on that together, we can do that on our next call. So next... next week as a you and me Lorenz case that time. Or if you guys do you guys want it to be both of you every week?
01:05:09 - Lorenz Schuerch
I don't mind. If the Patrick's cool with that.
01:05:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
don't mind either. I don't know if you have a certain like if you were supposed to do certain normal ones, but I don't.
01:05:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm a boss and I can do whatever I want to get in trouble with the market. Have we met? I look like the subservient tied to you? I got into this business so I could be the boss all the time. Okay. Anyway, no. I mean it's whatever works best and I feel like so I wasn't sure I felt like someone one time might be better, but actually I feel like there's there's enough similarities and I think we probably have more productive calls with the two of you together. But I want to leave room if there was, I wanted to, and I don't think that there is any need for it, leave room in case there was anything that was maybe of a sensitive nature on the team, or you didn't want to talk about it in front of anybody else, but it doesn't seem like there's any of that, you guys are both pretty open, your teams, you know, you can talk about them a little bit, and the individual. It's not like we're talking very personally or anything, so that shouldn't be an issue, but I wanted to make sure that there was space in case that did work better, but I do think that we would have the best conversations if we did it all together every time.
01:06:38 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, I think so too.
01:06:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so it's slightly, it's one more call a month for you guys, and if there's a need to reschedule, we can do that.
01:06:50 - Lorenz Schuerch
It's nice to be able to have like the same time every week as much as possible, but some things, sometimes something will come up, so just there might be, so Two weeks, my wife and I is anniversary is this weekend, but we have a soccer tournament. So it's not happening. So in two weeks, I'm going to try to take her camping and it might fall on Tuesday.
01:07:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So if that's the case, then Patrick will just have to deal with me by himself, or we can reschedule. We can do either one, depending on how much time that you're gone.
01:07:24 - Lorenz Schuerch
Okay.
01:07:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So sorry, Patrick, but all right, you guys, I will let you go. I feel like I feel like it's going good. I do know how this organizational stuff ends up and it generally just it creates a level of peace and certainty because things are so structured. You just know what you're doing. You know why you're doing it. Your team knows what they're doing. They know why that they're doing it. And so what we're doing is removing a lot of the mental. friction. And that is what can create a lot of drag throughout the day. And over time, it's like, okay, I'll give you this analogy, then we'll go. Do you remember what it was like when you first learned how to drive?
01:08:15 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah.
01:08:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you remember like being at an intersection for the first time and you're trying to process all this stuff about your blinker and the light and do they go or do you go put gas and like break and like all of the, and especially if you're driving stick, that's a whole another amount of calculations that you're putting in there. learned a mistake. So you have to mentally process every single thing that happens simultaneously. And if you're wrong, you die. No pressure. But eat and listen to the music and have a conversation. And then I'm not stressed out and driving is peaceful. Like, when did that happen? I don't know when that happened. But somewhere along the line, this thing that I have to process and just almost shut me down every time turned into something I enjoy in a super easy. That's what this does. We take the complicated things and turn it into a process that we practice over and over again to where you just show up and you do it. not only is it easy, but you're good at it. You're not one of those drivers that's running people off the road. You're one of those ones that's like, I see you crazy person. I'm going to give you a little bit more space, so we're not going to have a wreck. I don't carry out my merry little way. So that's what this does. That's how it kind of brings the pieces that you just get super clear on what needs to happen, and why it needs to happen. you can make multiple kind of difficult decisions without really thinking. about it because you understand the nuance of all of it and how to anticipate and how to react instantaneously. Make sense? Yeah. All right. Y'all need to calm down. Just lay off the caffeine, the coke, whatever it is that you're doing. That's keeping you so hyper. Just chill out. Have a good day.
01:10:23 - Lorenz Schuerch
crazy.

Yeah. She lost a lot of blood after the delivery. And it was really tough for them to control it. So she lost almost half half for over half of her blood. you. So she had to take a transfusion because she was like, every day her blood was going down like this. And she getting weaker and weaker and her heart was like changing so really well so yeah.
00:01:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good job for modern medicine if it wasn't for that then I would be dead many times over especially when it came to childbirth but even along before that so you know it's um as you know statistically we do really really well but childbirth is still traumatic.
00:01:29 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah it took them over an hour to find where she was bleeding they had to get like a special tool and they couldn't find because she just kept trickling and trickling and trickling and trickling and they're like is this the uterus and then they found it was actually just terror just way up inside and uh god I was just like how do people at home birthing centers do this like it's crazy to me but they don't make it work I guess.
00:01:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well they have backup doctors and hospitals for emergencies that's how. That's probably true. They know it for sure.
00:02:01 - Michael Fujinaka
That's true.
00:02:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's I mean, almost every place. That's what you have to do is you have to have a backup plan and and every midwife has a doctor that they work with those that if there's an emergency, they've got established networks, just like you guys do with attorneys and things like that for what you have to do so that they're not having their patients go to somebody they don't know anything about I see back backup plans for everything we don't we don't do babies haphazardly yeah I'm gonna say okay so you sent a lot I've got this hair that just keeps poking me in the eye and it's itchy me and driving me nuts and anyway so I'm just gonna scratch my face.
00:02:45 - Michael Fujinaka
time we're having a face to face it's I'll tell you it's much more and not intense but I'm like oh I really gotta be honest we can do we can do just audio and I like it. I like the face-to-face. I think it all it I feel I feel it more, you know, that accountability though You were wanting so if you could see that teena expression That's what I'm getting us in on.
00:03:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you My face doesn't lie It may tell you I'm holding something back, but it'll tell you a lot unfortunately it gets me in trouble So All right, so I've got my notes Um, let me just scan them again because I prepped them last night and see where I want to start with.
00:03:39 - Michael Fujinaka
Oh, okay. Thank for postponing our monday's call. Sorry.
00:03:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
notified he's so late, but thank you This we are real people And as parents, this is one of the reasons I love working with parents or At least people that prioritize family is that um, you know flexibility matters. I'm very much a punctuality and respect time kind of person, but respect the person first and the time second, right?
00:04:12 - Michael Fujinaka
So thank you.
00:04:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Really, just good communication, if it's last second, it's not going to matter. But I would expect the same from you if I'm like last second on my daughter's having an issue, I need to go do this. So, but that is part of the things that I learned to do in business too, is make sure that the people that I work with on a regular basis, so like customers or patients wouldn't necessarily be the same thing, partners and anybody that you have like a consistent kind of energy exchange, you want to have at least compatible values. They don't have to be the same, but they have to be compatible so that the things that are important to you, you never feel like you have to apologize for. And likewise, that's a gift that you get to give to somebody else that reciprocity, right? that they know that they're safe with you and comfortable with you and I was one of the most liberating things that I ever did was change that in my practice and let's see how long has it been? I would say probably nine years and I've been doing this for 22 years, um really more aggressively. I mean honestly I fired, I fired my main client that I'd had for nine years last year so it's uh everything is iterative line-up online kind of kind of type of thing where you you we grow in degrees I guess it would be an even better way like you think about the way that the sun comes up and the illumination of the earth it is um by degrees literally degrees right? It comes up and you know that it's coming up and you can tell that it's coming up and you can at more light and you can feel that warmth like all of those things that the sun gives increases just slowly and so we grow the same way and it's important to keep that in mind because you can't rush the sun we can't really rush our growth either you can't skip a step it can't go from here to here it has to do the whole gamut so anyway uh these things okay so long version of glad we could be scheduled welcome to adac right anyway so i did review your sleep journal and um and your journal journal which my writing is pretty bad so i'm not judging but it was a little difficult i was like let's just say and i think i deciphered most of it but um let me move this over here so i can see i've written the journal like the same way i mean i started writing a journal when i was about six six or seven years old when i
00:07:00 - Michael Fujinaka
All the way through college, I in college, continued it a little bit in med school, then stopped, continued it a little bit after I graduated when I was like 32, then I stopped. But yeah, I've written like my journal entries back when I was six years old, look almost exactly the same, like the content looks the same and it looks the same, it's really funny.
00:07:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's awesome.
00:07:26 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, it's always been just a very narrative of like what I did, because if I remember what I did, I remember how I was feeling generally. I never really needed to put feelings in because that's how I remembered it, but yeah, so anyway, the content of it is almost the same as what I first started.
00:07:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, that tells you though how consistent you are. And I wouldn't say that you're not changing, but because that's a kind of core internal practice. that that shows your steadfastness, which I think is a very good quality, personally. So, let me go to my notes.
00:08:14 - Michael Fujinaka
I did cut out, I used to be obsessive about time stamping everything. I used to put like the time my mom would take me to school, what time my mom picked me up, what time we'd arrive home from school, what time I would start eating dinner, like it used to be crazy. Like with time stamp. So, you know, over the years, I've gotten better at like letting that part go.
00:08:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
yeah. Do you have a tendency towards OCD type stuff or just? No. Just in that.
00:08:41 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, just in the journal, I wanted to be super detailed about my life. No, and no other part of my that OCD.
00:08:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah. So, to acquire that practice at age six, what was that modeled for you?
00:08:56 - Michael Fujinaka
No, I was, I think when I was five or six, I started. to fear death a lot. And I started to go to my dad and mom and I was like, don't want to die. And I was you talking about? And I was like, well, at the end of this life, you know, my experience, I'm going to get shut off like a TV. And, you know, I'm going to maybe I'll go to heaven or some spiritual place. My mom's Christian, my dad's Buddhist.
00:09:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, well, I'm going go somewhere.
00:09:22 - Michael Fujinaka
Right. I like, I like this. I like, you know, I like this experience. I like this life. And I'm sad. I'm going to be sad when I leave it. And then, you know, we had the talks about live one dies and, you know, you go to a better place. And I was like, I want to remember this life. And I think when I was five or six, I started the journal as a way to feel like I, I had a good life or something.
00:09:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It makes perfect sense.
00:09:50 - Michael Fujinaka
I don't know the exact like reasoning, but I was like, yeah, I might go somewhere better. Heaven or, you know, the Buddhist Nirvana or whatever. But I want to, I like, I like this. I like my family now. like everything about this. So, yeah, that's, that's kind of why I started to feel like my life was, was a life that I remember. And that's why I started writing.
00:10:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're kind of special foodie.
00:10:17 - Michael Fujinaka
I don't know.
00:10:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You are. You are. kid. And any time we talk to Mark, it's only been a few times. he would tell me how smart and amazing Esther is too. So. Just a whole bunch of awesome foodies. Okay, so Look at this. Okay, so what I what I would like for me, you know, specifically, and I can, where did I write it down and the notes. Oh, and I realized I had sent you a a message. I thought it. I sent it got to my desk today and was like, oh, it's in my draft. So it's the big rocks video that I watched it.
00:11:07 - Michael Fujinaka
was funny watching that lady getting tortured.
00:11:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She was like, I can't fit these rocks in. And you're really like about four minutes. Yeah.
00:11:16 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, so I watched it and it was good. But we talked about it last the first visit, the first time I talked, I think we talked.
00:11:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. And that visual, though, just is kind of different because she was really aggressively trying to move things around and pack it in there. And it was not possible. And that's why I just thought it was such a powerful visual is that, because he told her what it was and what those things represented. And she's like, I have to get that in there. And then just couldn't make it happen because it had already been filled up with the little things, AKA the minutiae, right? So that's real life. I mean, he came up with that analogy and that visualization because. is that is what people do. And so the reason I love, even though we had discussed it, that visual will be in your mind forever more. And it may come up as something that you can teach and give to somebody else. But I love when we can, first of all, just draw a picture in our minds. But also when we can translate that picture to someone else because that is what we remember. When we're little, that's how we think. Anyway, we don't have words. We just have kind of pictures. anyway, glad that you watched that.
00:12:38 - Michael Fujinaka
It's funny, like last night, I texted Mark super late. I woke up and something you said, you were pointing out things you asked in the email. Do you have a personal chef? Do you have a personal housekeeper, do you have a personal assistant? And then I responded to that. But then I texted Mark, was like, you know, I know I need to learn better. I've had two personal assistants. One for a year, the other one for, yeah, another one for about a year and a half. And like we gave it a go to get me to let go of the minutiae and to trust the personal assistant to take care of things like scheduling, booking, and through both of those, those personal assistants, I just have the hardest time letting, like still, first of all, I didn't give them enough tasks or enough things to do because I wasn't letting go. And so I texted Mark last night, was like, you know, that I've read that from Tina, like I gotta learn how to use a personal assistant, like I see people that I respect using personal assistants, I see the benefits, like, and then you sent me this video this morning, I was like, oh my God, and you know, like I gotta learn how to do this. So I'm gonna talk to my wife and Esther and, you know, see if we can go ahead and do the personal assistant thing again because, I know, I mean, I see the visual, I know, you know, important it is to learn to let go of the minutiae, let someone else handle it, and I've just straight up failed a lot. I think I got better, like with the second one, I started to let her plan more things, she started to, you know, help me with, when I was taking Uber, she helped me figure out the times and, you know, just little things that made it easier for me, but I think there's a lot more I can offload.
00:14:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so, let me combine a few things real quick. First of all, did I have you read Switch?
00:14:36 - Michael Fujinaka
Did you read it? Yeah, I'm listening to on an audiobook, so I'm about into about chapter seven now.
00:14:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Have you gotten to the experiment of the where they have the baked goods?
00:14:49 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, the cookies one. Fine, will power.
00:14:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Fine, will power. Okay. Remember, though, that the difference was. So I was, I was tying the willpower specifically to cognitive function and the ability to process or basically just make decisions. Now if you're having to now, okay, so now imagine all decisions are the rocks and you've got the pebble decisions and you've got the big rock decisions. If you were the one that has to make all the pebble decisions, what does that mean about the big rock decisions?
00:15:32 - Michael Fujinaka
Targeted.
00:15:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so are you familiar with the Pareto principle, the 80-20 rule?
00:15:39 - Michael Fujinaka
Yes.
00:15:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so this is part of how I've been able to let go of things myself because I'm a Virgo perfectionist with all these things, right? Firstborn daughter, I have the odds stacked against me, if you will, for being a control freak. definitely have that tendency. But, and this is how I've also been able to talk other clients and to let you go. When you think about everything that has to get done, if 80% of the results come from 20% of what we do, if my if that 20% is optimized and leveraged, and I'm functioning at the highest level, then that 20% that somebody else does, or that even that 80% that somebody else does, isn't that big of a deal? And maybe, maybe they do it 5% less than me, less well. Maybe they do it 15% less than me, less well than me. But because my power moves, because I'm freed up to make more of them mentally, energetically, because I'm more optimized, mentally, energetically, physically, Unfortunately, all of these different nuance of our personalities that go into how effective in each of our actions are, all of that is going to be better. And so whatever may suffer, the end result is that more is benefited. And the things that matter most, let's go back to the big rocks, right? Those things are there and they're the best versions of themselves as well. So they didn't just make it into the bowl. They made it into the bowl, refined and polished. That makes sense? But it depends on what kind of things you're doing and also who you hire. There's a lot to that too. So a personal assistant needs to be again, compatible values, compatible energy. And if they were interacting with you unestra, then it needs to be compatible with your entire family. So that automatically discounts many, many people. Hiring is especially this type of person. This is the kind of thing you wanna get really good at. And so it actually might be your hiring process. That was a bigger issue rather than your ability to let go. So a lot of times when somebody gets to this point, they just want it off their plates. Yay, yay, work, let's go, right? And then the other thing is not spending enough time on the front end, teaching, empowering, communicating, making sure that we're on the same page. And so just here's a list of things, do the best you can, kind of sink or swim, or here's a list of things. Here's some training, but not necessarily that I need you to communicate like this. I need you to understand that these are my values. So that you understand how to prioritize. by filtering through my values because you are the extension of me. So if you are not using my values to make the decisions on my behalf, which I have now deputized you to do.
00:19:17 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, that's true.
00:19:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I'm doing essentially, right? Exactly. Exactly. So the first thing is you have to start with what are your values. Now, fortunately, we've been already doing groundwork for that, right? Because you have a whole document of family values. You can have the same type of document when it comes to your time and your work. Like, this is how I communicate with people. I need it to be succinct, but I need it to be thorough. So don't give me half sentence answers and don't give me 10 paragraph answers, right? Three paragraphs, very clear.
00:19:54 - Michael Fujinaka
Always wants the 10 paragraph. always want like the three sentence.
00:19:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. So. Oh, this is how you, you, you call them that, right, but, but what you do. So let's say that's text, right? So when I, one of the things I teach people to do because I'm a with my ADHD, of all trades, I study everything for way too long. But, and as going through, so Perry menopause and brain fog with women and ADHD, it's like, I've had to work much harder to maintain in my cognitive function and my ability to focus. So I want thorough communication because I want to have the conversation once, have all the information I need and be empowered to go and get to work. Because I like to work, I like to build, I like to create, I want all my Legos together, I want to know what color, what parts, I want to know everything's there, and then don't talk to me I got building to do, you know. So, so I want the 10 page thing as well, but I want you to. to bold bullet points use formatting so that my brain can skim it first, see where the important things are so that when I come back to it, I don't have to go like this. Where was that one thing one detailing? Where's that one Lego that I wanted to put on top of this thing over here? I think I keep showing my nerdiness. But anyway, Legos.
00:21:26 - Michael Fujinaka
Anyway, last night with Emmy.
00:21:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome.
00:21:31 - Michael Fujinaka
Were they make a block spell? Yeah, we have the bigger ones for her. Yeah, I don't know what size they're the bigger sizes.
00:21:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:21:40 - Michael Fujinaka
So you blow.
00:21:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's called a deep blow. Oh, yeah. Okay. So that's the thing. You want to train them to and also you want to know, look, are you looking for this long term? Because honestly, it makes more sense to hire somebody who wants to be doing this long term. So they get better and better at
00:22:00 - Michael Fujinaka
their job. And the last two that I've had, you know, we knew that like the first one we had, we knew she had about five to 10 year work life. then obviously it didn't work after a year and a half. And then the second one, she was more of a, she was definitely closer to like three to five years because she knew that she wanted to go back to school and three to five. So we were only expecting three to five out of her. But yeah, that one didn't work after about a year and a half.
00:22:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Also, that's okay. So like even three to five years, because if they're good enough, then you let them know you're going to hire and train your replacement.
00:22:33 - Michael Fujinaka
That's right. Yeah. So they both said, okay. And then we just never got up to that. But I think yeah, that what you just brought up. I mean, we actually bought a training course, how to work with a PA and it says all like what you said. But I think now hearing it again, I'm like, yeah, we probably didn't get the hire right first of all. And then we didn't lay, we thought we laid groundwork. mean, you should see the documents we have. yeah, I think starting at values, you know, we didn't have the Size quite enough and yeah, you're right. think laying the groundwork would work a lot better if we try and also So a personal assistant is a doer. They may not be a reader so much. They might not like to read long training documents So if you're hiring somebody and you didn't ask them how do you learn best?
00:23:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, I didn't do that Do I need to demonstrate things for you?
00:23:23 - Michael Fujinaka
Do I know your love language when you're trying to date someone or something, right?
00:23:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because it is a human being that you're hiring With the personality and as much as they might want to do the job exactly the way you want to Their brain works the way their brain works their energy works.
00:23:38 - Michael Fujinaka
I believe they they wanted to help me but I like yeah, I couldn't Yeah, okay. Yeah, I think this is something and the other thing is they're both virtual And when I straight right talk, you know, there's a lot of things that we need unloaded and I think you saw that in the documents That it would be really helpful to have a local Yes, not even like someone here, but just somewhat in our area. So yeah, I'll talk to Esther and I think we should revisit this personal system.
00:24:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would be happy to answer any questions. have any chance with you and Esther. Anyway, you would like to use me. Let me know because I'm here to support you and to the point of front-ending, front-loading, which basically means just there's a lot more work in the beginning and then you kind of smooth sailing down the road. When it comes to training a personal assistant, that's how I train, how I kind of approach coaching too. Like in the beginning, there's a lot more work to do. And then it's not so much maintenance because we continue to grow and evolve, but we've gotten the groundwork in. So like anything I'm doing with Mark now, there was so much data to acquire, especially with his firm. then the program that we used to track everything was not built intelligently by any means. And so the first year we spent trying to find replacements that didn't work, there is no such thing. Then there's, you know, do we build it or do we work with what we got? And then finally came to the decision, we're going to have to do the best with what we have. But that was a whole long process, like a year and a half. And so then, well, if we have to work with what we have, I'm not doing it. Are you doing it? I'm not doing it. Are you doing it? Okay, let's go find the person who wants to do it and who enjoys doing it and who's good at doing it. And that took almost three years to find from the time that we started. But again, that's the sun rising.
00:25:51 - Michael Fujinaka
takes progress.
00:25:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is. But in the meantime, we doubled, almost tripled, Everything doubled, we're almost tripled the revenue that's coming in. Now we haven't improved the profit margins that much, but again, you can do all the things it wants. You get this thing and then you get it to a maintenance level where it's now up here and then you get this thing and you bring it up here and now it's all working together and then you get the compounding effect, especially financially, here after a year. So that's where we're at right now. So if you want any, either additional calls or we use our weekly call and I help you with some personal assistance stuff, we can do more emails back and forth. There's all kinds of different things. So basically use me because this is a huge lever and an assistant.
00:26:53 - Michael Fujinaka
I think we're alluding to that and the family goals that, you know, the comments. And I think. You know, that comment you made about, do you have a personal chef, do you have a housekeeper? I mean, those are the things that me and Esther have been like, yeah, if we had one of those two things or both, that would just make a huge difference.
00:27:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so I- life-changing for me. And when I first hired somebody to clean for me, I couldn't afford it. But what happened was, and it was a lesson that has stuck with me repeatedly and is ingrained into my brain, and it was that 80, 20 rule kind of thing. was two things. There was the energy saved in doing the work. And then there was the energy boost from having it done really well and done consistently. Yeah. I never even had to think about it.
00:27:48 - Michael Fujinaka
But I also- We have a housekeeper every other week. So it's that, oh, that what you just said, like Esther and I, like that boost, we're so happy when the house is clean, and like we're not spending our life life force cleaning like we've had it for like a help. We've had a housekeeper now where a house cleaner for about two years now. But I feel you on that.
00:28:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
feel you. But I would I felt guilty at first because I will you know I was poor growing up but that wasn't really the issue. It's the the sense of humility and so like I had money issues too and I think I said this in the beginning I felt like money was bad because you know that's the thing that poor people tell themselves to make themselves feel better about being where they're at is that people with money are evil and or that they think they're too good for them and I also lived in gang and violence areas and one of the things that people use crabs in a pot you know pulling each other down to keep somebody from going up is calling them a cell which was like the worst thing that you could be is you you you sold out to somebody else. else and you left your people. And I got to a point where my friends changed. And that was really difficult for me, but it wasn't because I thought that I was better than anybody else. And I wasn't ashamed of where I came from. I wasn't ashamed with who I knew. What it was was that I had to craft my environment to be conducive to the goals that I had. So, if my environment and that meant the people in it, the things that I see, the messages that I get subconsciously but visually, audibly, every single day, the things that I see here smell think. Every day are either going to support or hinder my goals. And so, making those modifications, having the clean house, and then also learning how to evaluate better. So, having a clean house is very valuable, but who doesn't? doesn't really doesn't make an impact at the end of the day.
00:30:03 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah. And I'm not totally on the same page as you she I didn't grow up that like that but Esther did and that it was a struggle when we first did it but yeah now oh yeah we're like we're all about it that's why like when you called that out on the on our goals like we could see like if we can get someone in here more of a permanent housekeeper instead of every other every other week we can imagine like how much that would help us and we can imagine how much having someone cleaning our dishes just cleaning our dishes let alone cooking the meals we can do two things right there and also as like because I was all I wanted to be Fuji was a mom that was it but to be a mom is cooking clean and nurture and soft and always present and when I got to the point where I didn't enjoy
00:31:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it cooking and cleaning anymore, but it wasn't because I don't actually enjoy that or doing that for my family. It's because I really enjoy using my brain. I really enjoy the higher level ways that I serve my kids. I love learning. I was in Honors in AP English when I was in high school and I got to, I think my first Honors class and my teacher was like, okay, we're reading Jane error. I was like, I already read it. Do I have to read it again? He's like, when did you read it? I said this summer. He's like, you read it on your own time and it wasn't assigned to you. And I said, yeah, he's just like, that's weird, but okay, whatever. So my point is that like, I've always been a little bit weird too. I like deeper things and being able to do that and balance out the other or aspects of my personality, you know, and know that one isn't better or worse than the other or more important or anything like that. So frequency, definitely. The other thing is, so go to 80-20 rule, about your energy, think about how much money it costs, and then the other thing sometimes is just even having somebody present in the home when you've got kids, so you definitely want somebody who fits in kind of well and doesn't make you feel like I wish they would hurry up and get done and get out of the house. Okay, because you don't want to be like, well, I don't want the housekeeper to come today because you know, like, I just don't want to deal with her here or that type of thing. So really kind of having a conversation about the personality, so back to hiring this type of person as well. Somebody that likes kids, somebody that is energetically aware, like, oh, you need me to not chat with you today and just get to work. Or if they're having a bad day, they know to check their problems at the door.
00:33:14 - Michael Fujinaka
That's a really good point.
00:33:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So you want somebody that but the benefit of that too is that because that person is not going to take energy away from you while you maintain them, they're only going to either balance it, right? Because if you deal with a lot of people, they're now, they might have clean the kitchen and giving you that energy, but dealing with them was so tense that you're like, I would have rather do this with myself, right?
00:33:43 - Michael Fujinaka
So we're trying to figure out like, should we combine, should we try to find a combined housekeeper and cook, or should we hire two separate people? Two separate people.
00:33:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I'll tell you why. First of all, if that person The person's not feeling good, on vacation, whatever. You've got two people down and out, two functions. So you don't want to do that because that's too much of an impact to you energetically. not only do you have to do the cooking, but you also have to do the cleaning, which we can go like, oh, big deal, I got a cook and I clean. It is a big deal when you have a system and you have a routine. And those things, just a mental load of trying to figure out how you fit it into the day and what are you going to eat for dinner? How long is it going to take to cook it? What do you have the ingredients? All of these things, when you're a person that makes decisions constantly, there's a thing called decision fatigue. And moms have it constantly because we are always thinking about all the things. We don't compartmentalize as well as men do the way that they think. So we're always making decisions. Sometimes ones we really. don't even have to make. We're having hypothetical conversations in our heads about conversations, making hypothetical decisions all day long and wearing ourselves out with stuff that's not even real. But we're ready in a second if it does come real because we already thought about it a hundred different ways.
00:35:19 - Michael Fujinaka
That's a good explanation of what Esther does.
00:35:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not just Esther. It's women and then if she happens to also have ADHD, times like a hundred.
00:35:32 - Michael Fujinaka
I don't know if she does. I don't think she has ADHD. I think I have it more than her, but I don't.
00:35:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It shows up different in women, by the way. A lot of women have been undiagnosed because it shows up so different. And the reason it shows up differently in women is because we're not allowed to behave the way men do. That's true. And it's changing, but we're still roomed differently. Esther's have a generation where that would still apply. behavior I was not as tolerated as in young women as it is in young men. They'll be like, boys will be boys. They will be like girls will be girls. No, no girl. You better get that going around to fix it. Right? So, um, yeah.
00:36:16 - Michael Fujinaka
really, really, really go ahead. I think that's great. think, uh, I think that's kind of the confirmation I needed. We, we had me after we did the family goals. I did start looking for a personal chef, just kind of laying the ground work on thumbtack and then, uh, I guess the thing that worries us about the housekeeper is we are, we don't tend to have that much in our house. Like, you know, we were thinking, well, maybe we do the housekeeper once a week instead of every other week and then make us feel better. when we looked at like the daily house, because I was thinking, well, let's get a daily housekeeper and a daily chef. I don't think you need that.
00:36:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh. Small.
00:37:00 - Michael Fujinaka
Okay.
00:37:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And grow as you need to grow.
00:37:05 - Michael Fujinaka
Okay.
00:37:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I see. Because what you'll find is that, because it isn't intrusive to have somebody come in your home. Yeah. And if they're doing something for you, it's disruptive at the very least. Because they're not part of the family, they won't permanently be part of the family. It is a blip in the dynamic throughout the day.
00:37:25 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah.
00:37:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what we're working. So what you're looking for is, again, back to the 80-20 role. How much is your 20-80 that you really need to be looking at?
00:37:36 - Michael Fujinaka
So just going to once a week may actually be all the impact that you want. Okay. Yeah. And that wouldn't be too hard to adjust from the current. Our housekeeper has been begging to come every week. She's like, you know, if I came every week, you know, I'd be faster.
00:37:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Everything would be better.
00:37:52 - Michael Fujinaka
Yes.
00:37:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because now she gets to maintain instead of having to be clean every other week.
00:37:59 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah. She said to be cheap. for visit. And I was like, how is that possible? then, okay, I see it's maintaining and catching up or yep. All right. No, I think that's great. I think that's really simple. Thank you.
00:38:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that's really simple. We can implement that quickly. See how it feels. Exactly.
00:38:15 - Michael Fujinaka
Okay, great. Thanks.
00:38:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so now for the cooking cooking, I can tell you that one of my favorite things that I did was get a meal service. I use hungry root, but I've tried my kids are picky. I'm kind of picky with the foods that I have, but I wanted it to taste good. And I want variety. I don't think any of them have a ton of variety. So you may even like go with one week and a different one a different week. And that's not how most people do it, because they think, Oh, no, I have a service. No, you can control the frequency that you get things you can control how much you get. they'll have menus and you can get things that are pretty much pre made. All you do is to heat it up either in the pan oven or microwave.
00:39:03 - Michael Fujinaka
tried several. We tried, mean, we probably tried six.
00:39:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like we tried the purple one. We tried HelloFresh.
00:39:10 - Michael Fujinaka
More in the boxes like you're talking about. we've moved to Go Methodology and there's a couple, another one we use. But yeah, we have that already. Esther, we, Esther prefers cooked, like cooked here.
00:39:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:39:27 - Michael Fujinaka
Okay. So yeah, what we have, we have two mail services like you're talking about.
00:39:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you can also, there are some people that will like, they'll cook at their house and then bring it to you fresh. Yeah, she wants it.
00:39:43 - Michael Fujinaka
Made here. Yeah. So that's, and that's, that was the big thing about like, because Go Methodology is like fantastic. very little sodium, fresh ingredients, hits all the boxes for us, very, you know. But yeah, she, she wants it. She prefer, well, the other thing is too, the cleanup. Even with go methodology, like it comes in its own packaging and stuff.
00:40:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:40:05 - Michael Fujinaka
You it out of there, but she wants it on a plate, right? So we end up with plates. I think that energy of cleaning the kitchen and making it spotless, that's the part where we think if we have a personal chef, we'd expect them to do that. And so that was another reason to here. And then you clean up after yourself, you know, or something.
00:40:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what if you had one three or four times a week?
00:40:29 - Michael Fujinaka
Okay.
00:40:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
To start with what I'm saying is just play with this schedule. don't have to go seven days a week. Maybe you do five, but you can. There's nothing wrong with it. What I'm saying is allow yourselves to explore. Okay. And be okay with it. And when you hire somebody, let them know, you know, like, like a 30-day connoisseurial period to see how it goes. But be really clear about what your needs are, what your goals are, and be really clear. about asking them what theirs are, because you don't want them to just say yes, so they get the job. Just tell them, I'd rather have hired the right person the first time and keep them around, but that means that you need to be wanting this job for a long time and wanting to work together for a long time, but because I'm in an exploratory kind of phase, I need to know if you're open to that.
00:41:31 - Michael Fujinaka
I see, okay, I rarely do that, and I think that's really the higher finding out their values and then see.
00:41:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're coming into your home, you definitely want to know a little bit about this.
00:41:44 - Michael Fujinaka
Right, yeah, everything you say makes sense.
00:41:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Fuji, you have so many things to think about all the time anyway. That's the thing. Also, I'm a lot older than you, or at least a good amount older. but you probably like 15, I don't know, how old are you?
00:42:04 - Michael Fujinaka
Probably 29.
00:42:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
39, okay, so I'm not as much older than you, I thought. I'm 47, but still, I'm telling you those roughly 10 years, that's a huge amount of growth difference, especially after most of my children are grown, half of them are grown, ones about to be, so I'm getting there. But there is so much learning that happens in these next 10 years, and it probably continues to go like that. I guess it just depends on how much you're trying to accomplish in life. But there's a lot to it, and we're not trained on how to manage all of these things. So, you know, there's no, I mean, think about, did you just know how to be a doctor? No, and nobody just knows how to be a mom or dad. Like, you don't. Anything worth knowing or doing, and anything that... great and exceptional. We find mentors for or we really earn our stripes and do it the hard way. I prefer the mentor program.
00:43:10 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, I mean, when Mark told me about this, you know, I obviously never had a coach. But then I started to think back to the times I did have coaches, you know, sports.
00:43:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's where I always had coaches.
00:43:23 - Michael Fujinaka
And I was like, oh, yeah, and I told you at the first one, I always thought, you know, if someone was going to coach me, they would have to be like, Mark, right? I see that their revenue is ridiculous. They're operations specialist like I want to be. And I always had that like, oh, that had to be my coach. But then I thought that my best coach is, you know, high school, they weren't necessarily better than me. You know, they weren't necessarily a world champion. But they knew how to get it out of me. then that's what I mean to all you. I was like, oh, yeah, that makes sense. If she can make me, if she could bring that out of me, that's all I want.
00:43:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have a professional extract.
00:44:01 - Michael Fujinaka
It I in the right course with the spreadsheet because you were kind of saying, hey, let's dump a dump a lot of your tasks and I didn't really go that deep into it. But is am I on the right track about how I'm doing it?
00:44:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I hadn't left it this yet.
00:44:22 - Michael Fujinaka
Okay. It was just it was the profit driver.
00:44:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. The timesheet. Yeah, this is this is really powerful when we do it. Um, let's see.
00:44:32 - Michael Fujinaka
I just populated like one or two in each thing, but if I'm doing it right, I'm going to go deeper, but it just. Yes. Let me make sure I'm doing it right.
00:44:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:44:44 - Michael Fujinaka
This is right.
00:44:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. right. Um, so the things to eliminate. Let's see. Well, because this is 12 years old, I have, but I'm kind of revisiting it and wanting to change it. You do, but don't love and they don't add value to life, I should not get any value. So daily YouTube though, the thing that I'm wondering is, does it really not add any value to your life? Do you go there intentionally or do you just kind of scroll and do you learn anything because everybody does YouTube differently?
00:45:39 - Michael Fujinaka
I like the dopamine hit, I don't know what you call it, but it's like I like that little satisfaction is seeing exactly something that's interesting to me. So a lot of times I go to look at jujitsu, right, like I put in here, jujitsu is all over this spreadsheet, but like I see it. So I go there to, I go to YouTube and I like look at the latest, like usually there's like a fight once a week or, you know, there's a big match or tournament. So I go to watch the fights and then after the fights, I like, I go down a rabbit hole of like the moves that I saw that I want to emulate next time I go into Jiu Jitsu.
00:46:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So do you really think that that's something to eliminate, that that's not valuable to you? But I don't talk about values, how valuable and how much do you value Jiu Jitsu?
00:46:29 - Michael Fujinaka
I value it a lot, but the YouTube and the watching doesn't really give me anything. I purchase instructional and I have like hours of instructional that I'm working through.
00:46:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So like that's what I'm focusing on.
00:46:43 - Michael Fujinaka
The YouTube pieces are literally just for dopamine. see a cool thing and I'm like, oh, I want to try that next time, but I already have like what I'm working on to get better on through my instructional that I bought. So I know that the YouTube is just for like pleasure.
00:46:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's purely Just like, okay, but is there no value and pleasure?
00:47:07 - Michael Fujinaka
No, I mean, I think I think we all have to have fun and stuff to look forward to. It's not.
00:47:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where I'm getting it.
00:47:15 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah.
00:47:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a lot of things that we get from that. That's it could be ideas, could be energy, could be motivation. It could just be pleasure and it could just be dopamine. But we need dopamine. It serves a function. It's there for a reason. Now, not being a master of that dopamine process, acquiring process, that's an issue. Then you're an addict, right?
00:47:45 - Michael Fujinaka
Then it controls you. don't control it.
00:47:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you can give yourself 10 minutes day. When 10 minutes is up, even if the video isn't over, you can save the video for the next 10 minutes if you want to, but you cut it off. And now you're in control. serve you, you don't serve it. That's all that needs to happen. Everything should be in service to us. We are not in service to it. People we can serve, but things serve us.
00:48:14 - Michael Fujinaka
Interesting. Okay. Yeah, I can make that switch. think I wouldn't mind doing 20 minutes a day. don't think that's terrible for me and I believe that I should have little bit. But yeah, I think maybe setting a little limit is what I'm hearing, like decide on an amount and then give myself that and not feel bad about it. Because I do feel bad when I do it, but I still do it for like, but yeah, I think if I had a time that I allocated, okay, that would probably feel good.
00:48:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yes. And what happens when we feel good with that's energy, right? That's energy. what do we do with the energy?
00:48:52 - Michael Fujinaka
Whatever we want to.
00:48:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But if we're purposely creating good energy.
00:48:56 - Michael Fujinaka
like, I think last week, we talked a little bit about energy sandwiches just for a second. Yeah, yeah.
00:49:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Something that you really like, especially if you don't get to have it as much as you want to, creates a lift and energy when you finally do get to have it. Now you get dopamine and probably little oxytocin, because you're like, I finally get it. Either way, that's something that you can use strategically to place it as a reward, because that's what dopamine is, that's the reward center of the brain, right? For having accomplished something, you didn't want to do what had to do. So instead of just having it there and doing it whenever you feel like, or doing it because it's the end of the day, put it in a place in your day where you want and need a lift and energy. And now you still get it. But again, you're using it and powerfully, it's not using
00:50:00 - Michael Fujinaka
Well, that's interesting to like actually schedule a time when I know there's like intense work for an hour Yeah, that is like my sandwich Let's go Okay, that's great, I'll have to look at these notes. I heard a lot of really cool things like yeah the incremental Change in our housekeeper very simple to do looking for maybe a meat like a personal chef That's not like seven days a week, but maybe just three days a week or two days a week even like an incremental improvement I really like that and then for both for fall especially the new hire for the chef is really about digging into the values Of them making sure they align with what we expect. I like I will spend more time on that. love that Yeah Because the house is probably primarily more Esther's domain
00:51:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And make sure that she's very active in driving that her happiness, speaking of feeding energy in that domain and that space is probably going to be more impactful than you being happy with it. Not to say that your happiness doesn't matter, but if you're not home as much, and it depends on if you're always home for dinner, then it's going to be as impactful for you too. You know what I mean, but she's the one around the preppy, and she's going to be the one around. Yeah. see what you're saying there.
00:51:35 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah. Okay. That's good.
00:51:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So, and also, I bring in my AI note taker to these so I can always give you summaries, has action items that has just kind of the main highlight points.
00:51:52 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah. I saw it last time and it's like, oh, that's good.
00:51:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Cool. Can share that with you. So, yes, please continue to do this. And then all Also step two, um, I don't know if you saw the second tab.
00:52:06 - Michael Fujinaka
So interesting.
00:52:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:52:09 - Michael Fujinaka
Oh, now there's a score.
00:52:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I see. Mm-hmm.
00:52:12 - Michael Fujinaka
All right. Yeah, I'll start working on this. Oh boy. Yeah, this is uh, okay. Let's get into it.
00:52:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You guys are doing doing it.
00:52:22 - Michael Fujinaka
That's what we'll So you want me to finish step one and step two by next, uh, but okay.
00:52:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, great. could do that. I think I gave you, if I didn't give you a due date, I do have one, um, next Friday. Oh, yeah. Okay. let me share these notes with you Fuji. Oui Fuji. All right. So these are my call notes, um, and, uh, let me, let me see how I want to, you know what, don't worry about it. You, you can read my notes. but really it's going to be you need to worry about what's in AI notes.
00:53:04 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, I don't need to see your notes, okay. AI notes is fine. I saw them last time the AI notes were great.
00:53:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They helped me. So I wanted to have the time sheet homework done by actually not so 726. That's next Friday, right? Yeah, by 3 p.m. because I don't want it cutting into your weekends.
00:53:25 - Michael Fujinaka
Sure.
00:53:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I'm serious and time stay up like you have to be like I'm done. Or else what happens?
00:53:34 - Michael Fujinaka
$90.
00:53:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where are we? I'm at a massage cost. Yeah. Yep, that's right. Okay, so we're almost out of time. But this is good. Again, think about the sun rising, you know, like it just has to follow its path and all of these things are important. I really do want you to log food. Do you use like my fitness power or anything like that? I would really like you to do that. I really want to see how where your macros are at. I want to see where your proteins at, where your fat fat, what type of fats you're having. we're getting into sleep, these things matter. Okay. If we want to optimize sleep. because looking at your journal, your sleep journal, you had a few nights that were substantially different than the rest. Yeah. And I didn't see enough in your journal to figure out if there's anything in there, but for three nights to send out the way that they did. And what was it? was deep sleep was different.
00:54:49 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, that next day was awful. After the deep sleep, it was awful. No, there was, I think it was like July. Friday, Friday night was just I think hospital.
00:55:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's the hospital that night is just terrible. Yeah.
00:55:08 - Michael Fujinaka
So okay, that was just the format. Okay, just real quickly. That's how I did it. I did the iPhone sleep app on top. And then I did my or ring on the bottom.
00:55:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, what I would like. Are you using your iPhone or your watch? Okay, I would love you to get the app called sleep watch. And then we'll compare the two data.
00:55:35 - Michael Fujinaka
The problem with that one is I had to turn it on when I go to sleep. I thought, is that not right?
00:55:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know. No, you have to sleep with your watch, but it automatically. Oh, okay, auto sleep. So there's two apps. I forgot that they work together. So auto sleep.
00:55:53 - Michael Fujinaka
Oh, a kid track. Oh, I'm sorry. Okay, because I have the app. Oh, it does have. Okay. It does have. So it has been tracking.
00:56:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, we just green shot in text to me real quick.
00:56:04 - Michael Fujinaka
Yep.
00:56:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to see that.
00:56:08 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, so, okay, so it has been checking. So do you want me to replace the iPhone one with this one?
00:56:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, please.
00:56:20 - Michael Fujinaka
Okay, so don't, so you want to see the aura because we want to compare aura. Yes. The apples native. Sleep app used sleep watch data.
00:56:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you I actually want to see the bottom like it gets cut off and I want to see the bottom part there.
00:56:39 - Michael Fujinaka
Okay, the pattern.
00:56:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So like how much rust will sleep and.
00:56:47 - Michael Fujinaka
Oh, where's that? Oh, that part.
00:56:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So you want to screen shot like this. Yes. Yes.
00:56:54 - Michael Fujinaka
Okay.
00:56:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
want to see what your heart rate dip is.
00:57:00 - Michael Fujinaka
want to see. see where heart rate is. Oh, wait, that's lower down.
00:57:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You want that part? Yeah, I want to see everything.
00:57:06 - Michael Fujinaka
Oh, OK, so how do I can I?
00:57:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, so just a screenshot. Um, so if you let me let me go look at mine real quick. Really what I want to.
00:57:22 - Michael Fujinaka
Here's I sent you a third one. And the third one that's coming is their compilation. Is that what you want?
00:57:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's exactly what you're talking about. You're% dip is good. 57% rest will sleep is OK. Your heart rate. Wow. And your respiratory rate. That's good.
00:57:46 - Michael Fujinaka
Oh, this was this was not good. This was a this was yes. This is what two nights ago or no. This is Wednesday.
00:57:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can't tell I'll play around with this more now that I know that it's tracking.
00:57:57 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah. OK, but I think this is that was when we were in the house. but when she was two nights ago, or I guess it was last night.
00:58:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
15 recovering well, everybody's recovering well.
00:58:08 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, she's good now, and I'm just here to support her when she's done. You want me to get that picture into the Google sleep journal? Yes, please, that'd be then in addition, use the aura so we can prepare ordering.
00:58:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yes. Excuse me, thank you. One thing I want to know, and you don't have to answer this now, but ideally, when do you think work should be done each day, so ponder this, it will be in the AI notes. What constitutes a work window, meaning if you're on your phone and nobody's around and you're in the kitchen, can you send off an email? Can you check some stats, can you do whatever? and what constitutes it not violating family time, right? For example, maybe it's bath time, Esther's like, I don't need you, I don't want you, babies are taken care of. For the most part with two kids you'll probably be useful, but that's something to consider. constitutes a work window in the evening and what constitutes violating or not violating family time? And also my experience as a business owner and as a mom and the one who's doing all the things, my brain doesn't get to shut off because it's 5 p.m. And if I have to wait until the next day to get some of this stuff out of my head, I get frustrated. So I need a little tiny work window to get things out of my brain. But what I would like you to consider is that if you have a work window in the evening that it is very strategic only, it cannot be reactive. So there's two times of the day I don't want you to be in a reactive state which means no email, no reading email. You can originate an email, you can start an email, you can schedule an email and I don't and I only would want you to schedule if it's at night to go out the next day so it doesn't appear like you're available to talk and somebody hits you back and be like oh I we don't want it you know that's your time. So but evening time could be a good time for planning out big rocks for the next day for just kind of prioritizing so that you get or even just kind of creating problem solving, making list of things you want to research specifically. Speaking of research you should not be doing keyword research and SEO you should be hiring somebody for that. You can do that really inexpensively we can talk about that leader. you know, hiring somebody to do that 15 years ago would have been very different, but now the skill and the opportunities to hire somebody inexpensively, that really should not be what you're doing. So there are way more powerful things that that brain could be working on than keyword research. So that's part of also the time sheet homework and why I need you to do that. So I don't even remember all the things that we've said. Those are the assignments we'll give you. I know so we can gather more from there, but do consider what the evening should look like. When is the work cut-off period? Is there just a window cut-off period and then you get to work for another 30 minutes to an hour? I would not do more than an hour, 30-45 minutes of just strategic planning is probably going to help your brain to be able to just kind of unload and to get into your own world and space for a little bit maybe. well before bedtime so that it's it's got time to have a buffer and your brain can slow down so you can sleep but yeah so much to do so much to work on it takes time can't rush it can't do all the things at once so just keep at it and you're gonna look back a year from now with your two beautiful babies and just go this is good feeling better more peaceful lots more help around the house hopefully yeah let me know um you know if you guys have questions i don't know when you'll get to hiring because there's a lot of stuff going on with the baby and just recovering but feel free to use me and and i'm here to help you

Hello.

Hello. Kind of quiet.
00:00:18 - Seth Ellsworth
Almost be my hair pods.
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're nice and loud now. Okay. Well, I am struggling with energy. I'm super allergic to where I live. And yesterday I had an asthma attack. I wasn't sure I was going to survive. And I'm just kind of sleeping. Yeah, it was pretty scary. But also I've been through stuff like that. But anyway, my brain is just not, well, I don't know, my energy, I think my brain is fine. I just, and I feel tired. So hopefully it'll pick up. I've done all the things. It either will or I won't. But yeah, just letting you know how to time if you're like, what's up?

I'm used to it. Just got to let people know because my energy swings so much because of health. That sometimes people are like, what, like, is it me? Did I do something? So I just got to let them know at a time that I'm like, no, I'm fine. Everything's fine. It just feels different. Not me.
00:01:51 - Seth Ellsworth
Awesome. Yep. Okay.
00:01:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm excited for this. excited to see what you've been doing. I think if we can screen share. I've been praying for it every day for you and also for them so that we know that we can be inspired for them to help us them accomplish their mission and know how to package and put things together. So yeah, anyway, I'll be quiet. Thank you.
00:02:20 - Seth Ellsworth
Same. So we're thriving on the same level there. So can you see the workflow? I'm sharing. Okay, let me point out a couple of things here. They just did this event last week. Okay, they reinvent your self-summit and over five days they traditional summit style where replace available for a while. If you join our $39 month thing, you get all the replays, plus all 80 of my meditations or hypnosis audios.
00:03:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much of that for?
00:03:16 - Seth Ellsworth
They sell those on their shop. How much of these on the summit for? It was free.
00:03:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay.
00:03:27 - Seth Ellsworth
I think they had a VIP level. And they only got like 30 people in there. Oh, I have no idea how many people they got in there.
00:03:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I thought you said okay.
00:03:40 - Seth Ellsworth
I was like, wow, they had a VIP level. And this is because this this thing right here, I'm going to highlight it in yellow. This is their seems to be their new focus is building this community. This is this is on Um, mighty networks, okay, $39 per month. And I imagine, you know, that's, this could be a play that, and John mentioned this on our first call, it's called grow and transform. Um, getting more people into this would be freaking child's play with a proper email. Um, So this could be the guts of what we suggest for them as a focus. Um, So, so that's, that's, that's a potential direction. Now, just to give you a picture of, of their business model, they kind of have two paths or two buckets. And these are absolutely not clear on their website either. Uh, because there's a lot of confusing crime. crossover. But they have the RTT therapy and personal development. And here they give away some regifts. Here's the landing pages to get a therapy partner. So so Marissa does not do therapy calls. She has a team of therapists that are trained. And people book calls just like they would from any therapists. So there's that. This, if I had to guess, is a small percentage of their revenue. Because they're therapists, we don't know because they haven't asked those questions per se, the career, the career path where they become a therapist and are allowed to offer RTT to their, to their clients. That's the 15. This is the $15,000 high ticket thing. think this is probably 95% of their revenue.
00:06:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It based off of experience with other people and smaller models where they do a thing or they teach people or certify them how to do the thing.
00:06:20 - Seth Ellsworth
That's always the case. It's the teaching and certifying, yeah. Right, so this certification, and they do have a certification course, I'm sorry, they have a course and a certification, but it seems to me like they drive most of the traffic to the book a call stuff. So let's see, book a up here. So there's that. We have, they have events. They do these all over the place. They have events for both tracks. One, the track for people that want to experience their own breakthrough and the track for people that want to be practitioners and then they have events as part of their fulfillment. So there's marketing events and then there's fulfillment, fulfillment events. This is, this, their conversion is probably really, really high with this. don't do a lot of marketing events. And I'm sure that that expands a lot of resources and time and they're getting older. So I'm. An educated guess would be they don't want to do more events.
00:07:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:07:43 - Seth Ellsworth
So an evergreen thing that runs that sells this $39 a month deal to where they don't have to do this is the first time they ever did the reinvent yourself summit that's a brand new thing. I have no idea how it produced. And a lot, I watched probably 10 of those sessions released the replay and most of them were recorded previously, which is a big undertaking, but now they have an asset that they can use. just, my opinion would be, this is incongruent with RTT because it's a bunch of random value that is not going deeper with their unique ability. So Marissa showed up and she did, she was, I think on three of the days, she was the first segment where she led them through a meditation or a sorry, I keep calling a meditation hypnosis, which great, but to me, they're running somebody else's playbook here. which is incongruent with this offer. So what we would do for them, essentially, this would be what I would look at, is I would go to their, let me share a second. I'm sure my browser. Here's a re-event yourself summit. Lander. They had some ballers in here. Jim Wick. John Asiraf, James Altucher, Pace Morvey's huge. He's a $600 million guy. But he's real estate. And then, anyway, this is a very, very random sampling, which I think is good five years ago. I don't think summits convert very well. And I could be wrong, but if I had to guess, I would say this didn't exceed their expectations. Here are landing pages. This is a landing page for free gift that is for somebody who doesn't know what path they want to go on. Here are an example of four gifts that they give away for free. So you click on this and you fill out your name, for each of these. So potentially, we could take one experience from this bucket. This is the this is the heal your self personal development bucket. This is the I am enough meditation. She has a book called I am enough. This could be a big one because that could also support the book. So my questions to them would be which of these produce the most revenue. And then we would take this automation or sorry this hypnosis and automate a four or five day email based experience for this. And also do the same thing for their free gifts. Let me see where that was the free gift. Okay, here's the opt in for the training courses, which is essentially just a prospectus that or a guide that it can opt in for. But we can take either their prospectus or their guide and then turn that into an experience that's delivered over time so that people can determine if being a therapist is right for them. So that being said, that right now they're pulling, based on our previous conversation, they're pulling a lot of their therapists from those who go through the personal development track and they say, hey, this would be really fun to make money with. And so there's a bridge that goes from the personal development track to the certified therapist track. And that is, is this right for me? My, my sister-in-law is a, she's a fangirl of Marissa. to like hardcore fan girl. This is almost all she can talk about. It's wild. And she's the kind of know it all girl that, you know, she has a solution to everything that yells you. And she's been considering this, but she's still on the fence. So it's an interesting ecosystem. They have, here's their book of call, which is literally just a book of call. this apply now just goes to their certificate or their $4,500 course for their, they call it certification. So is only $4,500 and they have a $15,000 like business in a box version of that. based on what I understand. Anyway, here is the shop just to get a real quick overview. They sell bundles of hypnosis audios. And each one of these kind of has its own little bucket. It is very unclear which of these does the best other than best seller bundle. And then here they categorize these based on the buckets that they serve love and relationship, health, overcoming addictions, personal development, wealth and success, weight management. And these trainings are our courses. So there's also these other foundation certificate for hypnotherapy. um, foundation certificate for rapid transformational therapy, I guess you can get started for 240 bucks. Um, confident coach, certificate and applied and this is the one videos. They have trainings and then they have a certification and then a business and a box $15,000 thing. Uh, sold via phone call and live events, most likely. And also have a couple of webinars. I didn't mention that. Um, I don't really want to touch a webinar, but, uh, they have one. So it seems to me like the, the better questions would be which one makes them the most money. Um, is $39 a month, their current focus, if it is, why don't we turn their current assets into an automated evergreen experience that upsells people into the $39 month thing at a very, very high rate. At $39 a month, based on their current price points of their hypnosis audios and people going through the hypnosis, conversion rates gonna be really, really good. I wouldn't be shocked to have 15, 20, 30% in terms of immersion. So, this to me would be, I think we can be reasonable in our... communication of expectations. But to me, this would be a home run. I can't imagine not hitting a home run with this. This is right in my house.
00:17:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's so you have to keep in mind what their goal is is to break the $20 million ceiling. And that's really difficult to do with the low ticket offer. So there's more to it than that. So here's some questions that I have. And I'm going to give you a stop your screen sharing I'll share from in a just a basic little thing. And just share some questions with you. But I'm going to show them to you so that you can visualize it as my share. So these are the things that we want to know because there's several different things. And I broke this down. What's the right down at your revenue? But percentage of your revenue comes from each offer. You can see the power in understanding that, right? How much of it from? But we need to know from everything, even if it's only 2% comes from weight loss. need to know all of it. Chances are pretty good that they won't know off the top of their heads how much they might have a guess. And so the next question is, what effort is applied to each offer, meaning what ads, landing pages, just follow up sequence, what did they focus on? We need to ask these questions and also get a read on their answers. So you can ask them ahead of time on the call. But I'll get to this in a second. Do you have any Google or any other kind of analytics? We will need access to that. What things are you wanting to do less of and why? For example, Brian wants to do, Brian Kurtz wants to do less events. He's hitting an age. And that's why, because he's just, he's tired. And so it wouldn't surprise me if this is something that they want to do less of also. What do you want to do more of, and why? I would imagine they want to do more of a scalable thing, because they're getting older. we don't want to leave the question. We want them to answer, and we want them to answer honestly. And why we're going to find the gold and the magic is where what they have gets optimized with and overlay what they want, where they want to go. So let's say that the primary, and this will be the biggest issue, and the biggest hurdle, if the primary source of their revenue is live events where they sell people into becoming a therapist and becoming certified. that's what they want to do less than. That's a problem. Now, there are a couple ways to look at this. So it's a problem meaning that's the thing that's already working and they want to do less on it. What you don't know is what the onus is that they're putting on you. Is it Seth, I saw your thing that you do and I want that or is it that I need to break a 20 million dollar a year ceiling. They seem like the same goal to them probably, but they're two separate things because you're not necessarily saying that that's the thing that we can do, especially if when they think that in their mind, they're thinking he can get us to do that without us doing the thing that we're already doing. But it's much more difficult. Let's say they're selling that for 10,000. or $15,000 or $20,000 or whatever, and they want to cut that source off, and now, like, how many sales do you have to make at $39 a month to recover one $20,000 sale? It's ridiculous, right? how much traffic exists right now? Do you even have the potential to be able to do that? So then, here's the thing, what they may be able to do is transfer what they've been doing at events to a lesser degree through your email automation sequence, so partly the selling and the transition from, I've been taking it, now I want to do it. Or I took a career path and I was doing this thing, and now I want to do this thing. So figuring out, whatever their highest revenue thing is and figuring out how to make that experiential. So let's say that their biggest source of revenue and audience and fan base is their events and it's because they what people tend to pay most for is two things results and access. Access doesn't have to have results. Access is I get to say I met so and so I get to say I get to take a picture with someone so people will do that because they think it makes them look big better so people will pay big money even if they get no results out of it just to go see these people so that's something right. But the other thing is results so there's there's another play where you don't necessarily get access but you can say I went through the same thing that John asked or after it or Jim quick or whatever, or you can see you learn from them because they're your mentors because you took a masterclass with them, that type of thing. It's the psychology and the angle behind all of it. the other thing is how much does it cost then to put on those events? Well, if they're paying for those speakers and chances are pretty good that they're paying money for their speakers because of who they have on them. Generally those level of speakers you're paying for them because they're not doing it for free. It's part of their job. They get paid to speak like Marissa gets paid to speak. So how much money does it cost them to put on their events and then how many times are they doing events? Actually, let's go look at and what's the conversion rate and what's the the revenue. So Let's see, these are physical events, three in April, two in May, two in June, nothing in July and August, one in September. So that's a lot of events and that's a lot of traveling. And let's say that whatever, like you could put a price on how much the event costs, how much time it takes to do and how much set up. And then you've got a conversion right on top of that and how many people actually get into it. So what if, and you can only put so many people into event because of cost, because of travel, because of location. But what if the events could be either their virtual or something else where they're not having to actually spend as much money or as much time organizing it and it's maybe It's an evergreen thing, and maybe they can't because it's not as experiential can't charge as much, but maybe they can get two or three as many people in there, and the conversion rate might be less, or the price is less, but because they can get more people into it because it's less cost prohibitive, and because it's not location prohibitive and all these other things, and then your, so let's say it's a two-day event, three-day event, let's see, these are four-day events, that's crazy, that's a one-day event, that's a four-day event, that's a one-day event, that's four-day event, so they have one-on-four-day events. Let's say for the four-day event, you know, you break it across three weeks, like event, it's immersive, and it's super... accountable, right? It's like, did you show up for this? Did you do this thing? Did you show up to the thing? Did you do this thing all the way through? And so there's a potential that they could replace their events or even, you know, let's say they replaced half their events at their age. That's a big deal. If they only did, you know, event at a quarter and so they could charge more money for it because they're doing it less, then it's a lot less stress to them, a lot less effort, less cost, but they can charge higher prices and get maybe more premium level people because they're still offering this, they're just doing it in a different way. I think that that's an angle that you could bring. I think also, if they don't have a CMO, like, that actually does a really good job, that is talking to them about scaling and other opportunities and leveraging. I think that that is kind of, yeah, who is it though? How good are they doing? Because they feel stuck and they're not leveraging their email list. all the things that you said, you're seeing them all dropping them off.
00:27:17 - Seth Ellsworth
a Dobson.
00:27:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and how long has she been with them?
00:27:26 - Seth Ellsworth
I'm not sure.
00:27:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you know, if I'm a CMO, I'm not letting my people not do their email stuff and not be managing all of these things. So, you know, there's an angle of, do you want some more help? let's just like call yourself something. are you a scaling expert? you a retention expert? You're the completion. experts, but you have more gifts to bring to the table and a team who has other gifts to bring to the table and a $100,000 offer that you want to make. So I'm just telling, I'm just trying to help you figure out like what are some of the things that you could do and also learn from this in terms of like what people need. Generally, getting to this eight-figure business level, I can't even tell you, I've got one, my eight-figure attorney, how much is just left on the table and it's just, it's a slow walk, but it's a steady walk upwards, way less time working, way more money, and we don't have to change a lot. eight-figure people for the most part get it and you need them to get the help, they go get the help, like it's a whole different ball game than bottom seven figure people, like low seven figure people, which is what, you know, most, I can barely make six figures, even wrap their hands around, I think seven figures is great, but on a business level, low seven figure people are a lot of times just still struggling. Just, they got there by dumb luck a lot of times, or just by hustle and grit. Now, to get to eight figures, you have to have learned some things. A lot of that can still be hustled and grit. Like, it's really hard for people who aren't operating in the space to have any idea what it actually looks like. But, you know, showing up at events, there's a particular look they have, conversations they have, like, you just know that it's charisma, personality, obviously the psychology behind it, what they know, NLP, things like that. They know how to persuade people to do things. He also can teach and give real skills. It doesn't mean that they're great at business and optimizing things. And they know that, which is a key opportunity for you because you do understand conversions and conversion rates and how to combine. And also, I mean, it's just perfect because they understand the psychology behind it too. And you can ask them, you know, are you applying everything that you know about psychology to your email sequences? Answer is no, 100% the answer is no, right? So how much more powerful would your stuff be if you walked the walk, right? So you just show them the things that are left on the table. So going back to this, what percentage of, what do you call it? What's the breakdown of your revenue? What do you wanna do more of? What do you wanna do less of? That's gonna be really huge. And then where's the money coming from? from, and how do we leverage existing assets, traffic, et cetera, to break the $20 million dollar ceiling? And so, what have they been doing? Have they, even having to do more just to keep hitting the $20 million, they probably have, right?
00:31:53 - Seth Ellsworth
Because they're suffering just like most people.
00:31:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, right, exactly. how would it feel Also, is it what is the ultimate financial goal, retiring, selling, because we want to understand, you know, what it's going back to what are they want to talk to you about, like, says, stay in your lane, just build us an email sequence. So we've got to be really clear on that. do you want me to just talk about how I can build you an email sequence and off to the biases, or would you like to really go into kind of a business audit and an opportunity on it for. What, what I see that you could be doing and. you know, there's that. So that's a conversation. These conversations, these questions, you could ask ahead of time, maybe fill that out, pray about it, and we can meet again on Thursday if you do end up talking to them at all, or Friday, go in and start asking questions. But at the end, have a pitch to make because, and also, is it increasing wood, increasing margins, even if top line dropped a little bit, but bottom line room. is our goal. Especially if it's scaling. and lower barrier to entry. So it means it should continue to be scalable and growing like the, you know, $39 a month offer. Because what I think that the offer is, is that we do two things. We figure out how to experience, like email experience if I. What we're doing in their events. And then also. Apply the same treatment to whatever their other top two top three offers are. So that's a lot of work that's ongoing. But. Most of the work is in analyzing their data. Which. we can do together. Chris is actually also very good at that. The automations, so we're definitely going to want what's his face, but we can also probably go hire other people. And I can help you with that and we can do that on the call together and just go look for people together. And then I have a whole process for hiring and testing people. We can do that together too because we're going to want more people than that. If we're creating this offer and doing it more. And then Chris would be writing the copy which he'll be paid for.
00:35:40 - Seth Ellsworth
We might have to find somebody else besides Matthew because he's tapped out.
00:35:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can find other people. promise that there are other people who are amazing at automations and they're just quietly working for other people because they're not. They don't want to run a business. I just want to get paid doing their thing. My experience with hiring people this year compared to even just three years ago, night and day difference, I'm shocked at what they know because the world has just changed that much, especially since COVID, in understanding online business. So the resources are massively increased. So I'm not worried about that, we shouldn't be. With Copy, if Chris can't do it, we've got a whole bunch of people to tap and we can tap through him or, again, we can go out and hire. whatever has to be built, the biggest thing is that we need to have the money for it in the sale. So it needs to be, this should for sure be $100,000, not 75, and with a potential growth. So let's say that $100,000 covers the email. experience of their live events, plus one other thing that leads up to the selling the live events. So it's like a breakthrough challenge. Obviously, that's right, right. And if it's not, then we plug in the things that are. So either way, what I'm saying is that we do something that is akin to building them a breakthrough challenge and T three, right? So it's the small thing that leads to the big thing and it's all an email sequence. And the goal is to do that in a quarter, but you have to build it and then you have to, and that may take longer than three months, depending on how long it takes them to get us all of their material. And you need just tell them that, you know, like, if you could hand everything over to us the same week that we close the deal, then, you know, 90 days we could do this. But the odds are that most people take a while to hand everything over, and it takes a few weeks, takes about four weeks, a lot of time to get all the stuff. So they'll send you stuff, and then you'll say, I see a gap, and then you ask for it, you send a request, and then it takes them a few days, and then they send it back. So there's this whole process. The first 30 days is really just a transfer of access to things that we need. Then you have to create the framework and say, this is what I think it should be, and go back to them and say, do you agree with that? That's another roughly about three weeks, and then you start to build it roughly about six weeks. So that's where we're at with the 90 days, and... And then, so is it like, once we get all the everything that we need is 90 days from there? No. Or 90 days total, factoring in, it could take up to a month to get everything we need. Yes. And if it takes longer than that, then it pushes our timeline out. And we're talking 90 days from the first iteration for the first iteration. So then it has to actually be sold and we put people through it. And then we have to see how it's doing and watch it. So that's another 90 days, because it takes time to get that feedback going. It takes time to see if something's stopping them and then we tweak it. So really, we're looking at a six month runway to make sure that we build, launch, and optimize the first level. of whatever it is that we built. So the six month thing allows some fluidity between the 90 days, you know, it doesn't have to be exactly 90 days that we launched it. The bottom line is after six months, you've got something and we've optimized it and by now you should be getting your money back if what we're doing is applying the email treatment to the thing that makes them the most money. So but they don't have sales copy for that. So they do for a live event but it's an angle. So there's a lot to be built. So the hundred thousand dollars is we're building this giant thing that replaces what you're already doing and it's scalable but also we're building the feeder into it. we'll be building the copy for it. We're going to, we're not going to just give it to you and say, look, we're going to give it to you and watch it with you. We're going to give it to you and make sure that it's working. Whatever is not working, we're going to fix. And we're going to stay here until you get your money back from your investment with us. And that shouldn't be a hard scary thing for us because it's just doing, I mean, this is stuff I do regularly. This is what chris us regularly. We look at the offers, we take, tweak it and test it. So let's do the map, you know, if you, hold on a second, if we sell it for $100,000 to buy a buy.
00:41:46 - Seth Ellsworth
Is that one other, one other thing that I think is a big little mover for John, like he wants his team to be top notch. And I get, I get the fee feeling that his CEO, Skip Johnson, and Amanda Dobson are new. I think he wants, I think he wants them to be trained. So that is another level of this. like, Hey, we're 100 K and 30 K per. Order, like we'll be fixing this optimizing it, making sure your team is fully capable of running with it and the understanding the strategy behind it because we've taught them what we've done and why. So that they could potentially build other assets without us.
00:42:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, effectively, effectively working ourselves out of a job. So then maybe you sell it for it's 100 K plus for 90 days. And then it's. 150k for six months, which is a lot less for the follow-up, and we'll train your team. They can show up to all the calls where we are working together and diving into this. We will explain it. We will document it through a loom process of, look, this is what we built. This is the psychology behind it. This is how we analyzed it. This is why it's working. These are the things, the team that we need, you need an automation person, you need a copy person. We can tell you how to hire these people, you potentially, we'll do that. I think that's the, because honestly, an extra $50,000 for the three-month-light positioning at that way, 100k, it's 90 days. This is everything that we're building, and we're going to need, you know, An omniscience people were gonna have two copywriters like there's a lot to be built and and outline what has to be built Right, so there's the landing pages. There's the sales pages. There's the follow-up sequences that Nurture the people who didn't purchase from the landing page to the cell page For however many weeks and then there's the actual experience that is replacing a live event So you're talking about high-level Strategy that we're applying it to going through all of your material Making sure that we're choosing the best stuff and then turning it into experience like that is a lot of Mental work and we're paying high-level people to do it You mean Chris whoever else you know, we're we're looking at the stuff. So that's that's a lot and Then on top of that rather than building your dependency And then upon us, you know, obviously you're going to want to keep this skill and how as much as you can, we'll train your people to do it. And it won't really be an extra step. We're not going to say we're going to certify your people doing it, right, that they can do it. We're just going to make sure that they've got everything they need, which will be easy because what we're doing, if you want your clients to be really happy and you want to be able to get a raving testimonial, but you have to show them what you've done. have to show your work. So we'll create loom videos where we go through and say, here's everything we've done and broke it down so that they know and then we'll show them the data like, here was your baseline data. Here's what you were making. Here's this new offer. a completely new offer, right? Here's the revenue it's made. So we'll have evidence to show them so that they're like, I'm very happy I paid this money with you. I can see your results. That same material will work to train. There are other people because we'll show them this is what we did.
00:46:01 - Seth Ellsworth
This is the details of what we did.
00:46:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's one action, two benefits, and but also two values. We're not selling them on the reporting. It's just what's going to happen. We're selling them on training their team, but training their team is going to happen as a result of the reporting.
00:46:25 - Seth Ellsworth
Seven cents. Yep. So really just high level questions first about what's driving the revenue and then what do they want more of? What do they want less of? Customize our pitch to either that event based thing or selling the $39 thing for whatever reasons they want. then the offer under K over 90 days done for you 30k per quarter from there on out. Just stay on as long as they want. All this based on the fact that they want more revenue, they want less time spent, less resources spent, most likely, and their email game is currently abysmal.
00:47:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Non-existent.
00:47:16 - Seth Ellsworth
Yeah, so let's say their angle is, like for us, we also have quick wins, for example, when somebody opts in to anything, we just add the little reply trick, and that is a forced multiplier for the health of their email list as a whole, which is huge. They have a huge, huge list. I don't think it's efficient. I don't think they have access to their whole list, because it doesn't seem that they're the email very well, but they do have a very big audience on social media.
00:47:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
have lots of assets. So, that's something else that you could bring down, like if you're going to do a... atomized invoice, the email health and an email audit, you could call it, but you can put a price point on that and you have to, you can put down why it matters, why it's necessary, you know, so if they're like, well, what is it? Because most of time, the biggest thing that you'll get, so people that pay the most expect the least, the difference is, what am I getting for my money? That's a conversation that you'll have. What does my $100,000 get? People with the least amount of money, they want to be told you're going to make X amount of dollars with it, right? They don't want that atomized details. They want to know the mouthwatering details. People that pay a lot of money just want the bullet list because they can look at the value themselves. So the email audits, why it banners, you can break it down, open rights, conversion rights, follow up sequences, inbox placement, email help, all of these things are, and you can say like how much money do you spend on email, on your email holds, how big is your list, like how much money are you bleeding, and I don't know how much you want to get involved into it, but if you're going to be doing an email sequence, I would imagine that needs to be part of your service anyway, which is going and getting their sender score, and figuring out getting a report, you know, what's their domain health, what's their domain score, where are they emailing from, all of that, an email audit should be built into it, and it should be high value. So that, you know, look if I'm going to have you build all these emails, are they even going to get to the inbox? of your people, and what types, like where are you sending from, all these things. Anyway, so an itemized invoice of here's the copy, here's the automations, I don't know if you want to do that, I don't know, we really have to think about that, and I think looking at it will help us make a decision. Do we do it that way, or do we not put a price point next one, but say these are the things that we're going to do, email audit, write the copy, here's the types of copy that we're going to be doing, X amount of landing pages, a range of landing pages, a range of email follow-up sequences that are solely to ascend the opt-in person, the lead to sales, and then the email experience is a whole separate thing, right? That is the primary chunk of of everything. But for the email experience to work right and to work best, it means all of these other pieces into it. And then there's the analyzing, right? The iterations and optimizations, all the things that happen. So if you're putting together an itemized list and you're not putting, I would not put a price next to each of the things, but I would create an invoice. And this really should be your offer. And it will be specific to them, but you'll be able to model it for other people because it's going to be very, very, very similar, right? Which is these are the things that we're offering. So the small thing that leads to the big thing, so that there's a whole ascension process, the $39 all the way up to whatever the, become a certified, whatever, RTT. person, a therapist, in that thing, in their specific skill sets, in their therapy, that's telling me my brain right now. I'm also looking at like all their different words and things on the page while I'm looking at this, my brain is reading one word and saying another. Anyway, that's what it should be, so we should have that ready in a Google Doc, so we show up, we ask them all the questions, and ask them the questions. Basically, it's going to solidify what we already know, and it may allow us to tweak, so plan on some conversation back and forth between you and I in the background, as the call is happening, and then we give them the offer, and you have to decide what you want the price point to be, it's $100,000 $150,000. But the burden is that you have to convince them that they're going to get their money back and grow from it. Because, I mean, why spend their time if all they're going to do is just get their money back. They need it to grow. needs to be more than what they put in time and energy. Coming out with a better marketing team as a result of it, because you've gone through and got data. So, you're going to want to ask these questions. And are there marketing people going to be there on the call, do you know?
00:53:40 - Seth Ellsworth
So far as I know, I'm at Adopson and Skip Johnson, the CEO and the CMO, are as well as Marissa and John Davies are to be on there. Okay.
00:53:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, we're going to want to ask very specific questions, which will reveal what they know. they don't. So we're going to want to ask, okay, um, do you have a heat map on your pages? What percentage, like, okay, how much traffic do you get?
00:54:11 - Seth Ellsworth
Hold on a second. Where's my question? can figure that out.
00:54:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can figure what out.
00:54:16 - Seth Ellsworth
The heat map. I can just find the code on there.
00:54:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, you're missing the point. That's not the point. The point is we want to show what they know. So, um, do you have a heat map? It's a focus on what the point is there. Heat map. How many unique visitors per month? What's the bounce rate?
00:54:45 - Seth Ellsworth
What's the bounce rate?
00:54:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How long did people say? Do people stay on site? primary traffic sources, and what's the average time per landing page version great for offer. For average part value, per offer, or TV, per customer, per channel, per offer. Guarantee you they don't know these answers, almost nobody does. If they know them, they have an amazing marketing team, but we know that they don't have an amazing marketing team, because if they did, they'd be doing a better job of emailing, right? Okay, so what these questions are going to reveal is your marketing team isn't looking at what they need to do again, because the marketing team is going to be there and they're not going to have the answers. So if you don't know these things, do you have analytics we can review because we need days answers to optimize what you're doing. So that allows you to add in to your value offer, and you can cut it if you don't need it, but it should already be in a Google Doc with everything that we're offering, which is because we will train your marketing team on how to... make sure that you're optimizing all of your sources and that they know all of these things, but also they can review the results of your marketing efforts to make sure that each of these things that we're looking at is at optimal levels. And you just, that's just part of your value stack up. Here's the price point, but here's all the things that we're gonna get. So you're gonna, all these questions should reveal numbers and data and all that data should sell your offer for you.
00:57:43 - Seth Ellsworth
Seems to me we'd have to send all this stuff prior to.
00:57:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, you just have to have it written ahead of time because if you send it prior to, you miss the opportunity of revealing what's not known because they, their people can go scramble and look for these things. You need the CEO to know that their people don't know this stuff. And you need everybody to be exposed on the call that they don't know this stuff. So because they need to hire you. They know they need to hire you. they don't want to do is pay the price. What they don't want to do, their team doesn't want to be exposed. It's not knowing it. Why aren't you doing this? But what they want most is to break that $20 million a year ceiling and work less hard and have the money that they want to have. If they want those results, they have to get out of their own way. Why didn't they get out their own way to begin with? Because nobody confronted them with what they need to see.
00:58:56 - Seth Ellsworth
All right. Can you send me that? Nope. Can you copy it over?
00:59:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah So we have a looking at the Looking at the calendar invite we have a total of a half an hour Yeah, do you think they're gonna want to stop talking to you so if they do like first of all you ask all these questions really quickly when you have them And if your pitch is prepared you can get to them quickly I'm just posting it in the bottom of your work flow. You can move it put it wherever you want to so Eat the Having less time can just mean that they're foaming at the mouse dinner because they're like holy crap They just showed us everything we don't have and Everything we don't have is clearly why we're not getting where we want to be They also just showed us how they can give it to us and they're gonna they their brain's going to need to close that loop. Either we're hiring them or we're not. But if we are, then we need to figure this out if we need it, we need to get there.
01:00:10 - Seth Ellsworth
Yeah.
01:00:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, and you can tell them, look, only take on one of these a quarter. So, you know, I just want to, I think that this is ideal. I love what you're doing. I love what you're teaching people. You know, here's why I think what you do matters and why I want to be a part of it. And here's why I think what you're doing matters and why the world needs more of you. And here's what we're going to do to get that for you. also to make sure that you've got enough energy to keep serving because people need you. And this is how we're going to make it less work so that you can conserve that energy. We'll build this experience that can keep going. Even when you can't like that.
01:01:09 - Seth Ellsworth
I got those notes. A couple of thoughts. Thing number one, I'm just looking at my pension to way over deliver. I look at their four buckets that they have on their freebie page. They're four different audios. And I'm like, well, why don't we just build a four or five six day thing for each of those. And then, but that's four of these, which is four times the work.
01:01:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's your upsell after we've done what we're going to do. If you want to keep working with them. And if you don't, you can just say, hey, here's what I recommend. Go apply what we've taught you to each of these. Have your team do it.
01:02:01 - Seth Ellsworth
Do you want to consult with me?
01:02:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, here's a fee for consulting on it, and we'll have your team build it, but this my recommendation to you It's not where you should focus because you want to make them more money Right, so either way we should just focus on one of these channels one experience That we have a high probability of being home run because that's where most of the revenue is already coming from And then the 30 the 30k per quarter is essentially just for oversight and consulting And you don't want to package up like that. No Because they'll know if you say that they're gonna be like why am I paying that much for oversight and consulting?
01:02:52 - Seth Ellsworth
No So how do I How How do I not
01:03:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Stell myself into a corner why offering what I just told you so to me that leaves like a it leaves like a okay then what do we build next why are you even thinking about that i don't know it's more my mind naturally goes oh that's your problem you keep trying to extend things when instead of letting them finish and be done right maybe probably because i care more about the recurring revenue oh i was just about to tell you that's exactly what it is because you're like i got to pay the next month's bill you don't need to look at them for doing that so if you sell this and if you sell another one or two to other people with ending right and you want it to end because that's your wow factor and your wow factor is what gives you the big price points. You don't want to stay in somebody's team. You don't want to stay in their business. We let them come back to you for one-off consulting or something or whatever, but just go in, do the wow, then leave and leave them wild. So they keep telling people about your wow factor. But don't get in the grind of their business and having to and feeling like you're a part of their team, because then you lose the leverage that that gives you your price point, but also the energy and the way that they see you. And it's important for everything that you're doing with your high level people that that's how that stays, that dynamic stays that way. The money that we get from this needs to be budgeted so that there's money going to building out your own scalable office. That's where your next money is coming from. It's not from here. There is a very clear ending process we build the thing we leave if you want more you can ask us for more We'll give you a price point and it's not going to be stressed And you're not going to be built into a thing to be only thing that you're going to do from this point is consults Because we'll we'll tell you your team how to do it if you want to pay a higher price We'll even go hire people for your team to put in there and we'll teach them, but there's always an ending period So in this scenario, you wouldn't You wouldn't do a Risk reversal scenario where you'd say hey, it's a hundred K We'll stick around until you double that Sure, I would and there's no reason not to because that's not building you into a truck Because there's no way there's not enough potential for that money and
01:06:00 - Seth Ellsworth
Do you think it would be silly to to go for some type of a percentage?
01:06:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because this is the first time you've even tried this offer. Get some, get some evidence under your belt, get some more experience. Now you can do it at the end and say, if you want to keep me, here's how you can do it. It's a percentage.
01:06:27 - Seth Ellsworth
Because if that were the upsell instead of the 30k per quarter, that's a hell yes.
01:06:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and I don't even know where you got the 30k per quarter afterwards. No, the first like $100,000 for the, no, actually it was the response to yours. Like we go through and look at the transcript. When I was looking at, if you want to make it $150,000 for six months, and it wasn't considered Salting it was 30k per quarter. Basically we're building out these things. It wasn't like that.
01:07:05 - Seth Ellsworth
It wasn't 30 paper quarter for consulting I'm not sure where that came from Yeah Um, I would love to do 100k for building one of these and then they pay a percentage for us to go in and build out the other three That would be awesome Or four or five or six of these Okay, well don't get ahead of yourself because you've never had a yes on this offer at all No, I haven't And never built it Yeah, that's an end zone that I would that's an end zone that I would love for this particular business because It is A high degree of confidence with this one Um Well, there's so many unknowns including managing the team and and doing the whole thing together So I really want you to focus on what we've already talked about Yep, I'm part of minimizing it putting it on one
01:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
clear offer was to start to finish and I'm not going it would be cool if like just don't do that because that can sabotage everything if we get through this and then you want to be it would be cool all day long go do that but first you need a confident sale that you can close that you can take care of the family with you can have a team that you can build out your own offer which is going to take your time and focus and and be very very very practical with this there's lots of time for it would be cool if later and there'll be lots of opportunities but right now it just needs to be here's the offer here is that we can just knock it out of the park and this is what we're going to do for it cool and then in terms of price points like how do how do we be
01:09:00 - Seth Ellsworth
that we haven't taken swing yet. How do we confidently value this?
01:09:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Build out what I told you, which is the, like, itemized invoice that doesn't have a price point on it, right? But here's all the thing you're building. So quickly, repeat back to me what I said we're building.
01:09:20 - Seth Ellsworth
You asking me that or is that what I should ask them?
01:09:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I'm asking you.
01:09:26 - Seth Ellsworth
Well, I don't know exactly because it would be slightly different depending on whether it's the event based version or the low ticket front end.
01:09:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It should not be the low ticket front end and you shouldn't give them that option. If you want to knock it out of the park, you mean tell them let's experience it by your event into an email experience. But to build up to that, we'll take one of the low ticket options to build up to that and bridge a gap because if you want to get your money back, then There has to be high level stuff if you're trying to get if you're gonna be there till they get their money back at a $100,000 with a $39 offer you can be there forever Certainly they have six hundred thousand people on their email list Yeah, how many people do you think actually open it and how many people are even still valid email?
01:10:19 - Seth Ellsworth
You don't know anything about their email help I don't But you can assume it's crap We can assume it's crap. They're also flying ads and they have very active socials. So there's a lot of available to them Okay, so how many thirty nine? Here's here's how I see this taking Taking their hypnosis audios that they're currently giving away as a lead magnet Turning that into an automated email-based experience that converts it 30% to the $39 thing That's easy. That would be a very very simple simple thing, taking a live event and automating that to get the same result as or some result, no, not even similar, doesn't have to be someone that's either way, taking a live event and putting it into this type of a structure much more difficult. Is it possible?
01:11:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
course it is.
01:11:23 - Seth Ellsworth
It's much better.
01:11:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The bottom line is done right up today because we need to have time to tweak it. The itemized, what the invoice would be. So you asked, how do I confidently sell that $100,000? This is how. If you can't write it out and look at that and go, hell yeah, that's a $100,000 offer and also it's not going to be a whole ton of work for me because I'm having other people do it, then there you go. And if you can't do that, maybe you don't need to have a call for it. So write it up send it over Thursday.
01:12:02 - Seth Ellsworth
can work on Tweaking it and make sure we've got it nailed down and then probably see what happens Yeah, I think I think we should probably be prepared for Both options the event based one or the That the hypnosis audio version That seems to me that they're right there. I'm just Green with the way you just said It seems to you what it seems to me that if they've turned their focus to the thirty nine dollar a month thing for whatever reason So they've spent a lot of money all ready To to grow that It'll be interesting to see What their priorities are versus where they're currently generating their revenue, which has got to be the events To me it make that makes the most that's you're going to make more $15,000 sales from the event than you are from any other, they're not doing any other marketing. So it has to be from the events. What is it already wise? Is it the event or is it this new $39 thing? That'll be interesting because the revenue won't likely justify focusing on the $39 thing, like you said. But they may see that as their path to getting off the hamster wheel. I don't know.
01:13:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so to break even on a $100,000 investment in us on the $39 offer, we need about 2,500 sales. But if there's an episode, if there's something else next, $1,000 or $2,000 offer, and maybe it's something in becoming a therapist or whatever the next step is. There's some gap that we don't know about that exists, some mid-level offer that is not an event that we're replacing, but it could be the training or whatever, maybe a certification process or pre-certification process where you can sell it for, whether it's a few hundred or a thousand or two thousand, you know, the burden on that, $100,000, a hundred people buying $1,000 offer, and with that amount of traffic that they have, that's a no-brainer like that. We could do that easily. So I think that there's a missing piece there that we could plug in, which was one of the things I was thinking about before, and I don't remember how $39 members to $15,000 sales. Well, are they getting $39 members to $15,000?
01:14:55 - Seth Ellsworth
Sure they are, because he mentioned that the whole point of that group. It was to nurture them, to ascend to the bigger things.
01:15:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there, and there could be segments, you know, are there different types of things that they teach? they teach one thing, and so maybe they ascend them up through, instead of going straight to the $15,000 thing, it's, well, there's this aspect, right? This is, let us teach you about CBT, it's $1,000, let us teach you about the hemotherapy, it's $1,000, you know, and step them up through something. There's a path, and there's missing data points, where we can do that, but what they need to understand is that your way of doing it isn't just email, it's a very specific way based off of psychology, which they should appreciate that speaks to them, and uses, know, accountability, and actually is very much CBT, because it's getting into the head, like, who are you, what do you want, why are you doing what you're doing, are you watching? yourself behave the way you're behaving, is it getting you the outcome that you want? No, it's not. So you need to change your behavior. So here's how you change your behavior and changing your behavior is, you know, leaving them through a sale at the same time. That's what you've been doing. It is very related to CBT, which is observing your behavior, asking yourself if the current behavior that you have is getting the results that you want or not. And if it's not, then what are some options for how you can behave to get more of what you want. And then as you're watching yourself, are you seeing yourself through the right thing? Do the wrong thing? we get fixed it? That's it? That's the cognitive behavior there. It's a repeat.
01:16:56 - Seth Ellsworth
Okay. Awesome. By the way, I have heard back from Landon Ray.
01:17:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Have or have not?
01:17:06 - Seth Ellsworth
I have.
01:17:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And?
01:17:10 - Seth Ellsworth
He agreed to the 10K thing.
01:17:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is the 10K thing?
01:17:16 - Seth Ellsworth
Just a power day at onto Port Campus in June.
01:17:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice.
01:17:23 - Seth Ellsworth
So he's, I need to send him a one pager and he'll send, he'll get his accounting to send 5K and then 5K on the day of.
01:17:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good.
01:17:38 - Seth Ellsworth
So we've got some movement somewhere.
01:17:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So, I mean, I think for the most part, this week you've got, I know you have things that you have to fulfill and you need to get prepared for this. I don't know what else you have going on, but I would like to know what else you're going on. an appointment I need to get to. So I need to wrap up. But I think that this is going to go well. Either they're actually open to making the changes or not, but based off of the conversations that's happened so far, I would say that they are. And if you can just show them how, you know, this just makes perfect sense, but also clearly they need to stop chasing it. That conversation about, how much basically, how much harder have you had to work to get to that 20,000? Are you just coasting or have you had to work harder just to keep hitting that $20 million? And if you've had to keep working harder, how long can you do that? if 20 million is the number and you can't keep chasing harder and harder and harder, then you have to go smarter. this is what we've got, and you know, break it all down. It'll be important to Like, at some point, guaranteed, I've never been to a call where there wasn't something that was high value that I could add to it. They need to be primed for just even listening. So decide how you want to represent me. But it works best if you've done that ahead of time. This is Tina. This is what she's bringing to the table. So if I ask a question, because everybody's ego is a little bit different. I don't imagine they're going to be high ego people, but it could be. Um, so it's sometimes people like who knows this and why they ask them questions. So it's best to avoid that by pre-framing this, who she is. That's what she does.
01:19:46 - Seth Ellsworth
Yep. I already, I think I already did that past. Yeah. And my, in my original email, which you didn't see. Um, I said, I don't do anything without. her. She keeps from painting myself into a corner.
01:20:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There you go. That's enough. So that way, if there's there's anything I want to help out with, and I'm just like, I know I can add some power value to here, then then it'll be there for the most part. I'm just going to be quiet supporting and texting back and forth. But if I sense that there's a way that I'm like, okay, well, I can answer this question powerfully and clearly, then I'll do that.
01:20:28 - Seth Ellsworth
Awesome. I'll bring you in. Would you want me to, is this like a tag team thing, or would you just hop in? Meaning like, hey, Tina can speak to that.
01:20:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would probably just hop in. wouldn't even want to be to recall if I'm not hopping in, because then I can't be myself. And if I can't be myself, I don't want to be there.
01:20:55 - Seth Ellsworth
Awesome. So I will work on this invoice for both scenarios.
01:21:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because then you'll have an option. can just say you, without them knowing, just pick the one you want to show that and then go ahead and screen show so they can take look at it and break it down.
01:21:13 - Seth Ellsworth
If I had, if I had my druthers, what I would do for them, this would be, this is their entire business model. They have four of these running with their most successful four verticals that have proven to be the most profitable. They drive all of their traffic to those four. Those dump $39 per month members and then quickly ascends those who have achieved a high level of confidence with that and introduces the opportunity for a career with those things. Or it assesses their need for deeper therapy. And so all roads lead through this $1.39 month thing that liquefies at costs and makes it infinitely scalable, and we just pick people off and push them down each, each path based on, you know, any number of things that could happen. But we could build one of these to go on the inside that ascends them into the career.
01:22:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, and the great thing about this is that this is the type of thing that is perpetual evergreen lifelong. So whether you need therapy or you need to keep sharpening your own saw and being better at what you're doing. Come back to us as the authority for people that can help you, you know, continue your mental health journey, being as strong as you possibly can. So you live with us forever. That's the goal, right? Or, or same thing as becoming a therapist because the bottom line. as we all know that we need support and we're here to offer that to you. So whatever we need built is perpetual. mean evergreen not in terms of an offer that never expires but also your potential to stay with us as a customer lasts forever as well. And so we want to make sure that we show them that hey we're looking at it that way and we know that. And so one of the goals and the metrics would be life's and value their customer whatever is we want to increase that and extend that. And what you do says in the nurturing through email sequence has the greatest potential to do what should have already been on their radar and probably already the goal but probably not their success in the past.
01:23:48 - Seth Ellsworth
Yeah.
01:23:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I got to go but send me over what you come up with in your two versions and then we'll just you keep hammering that out. But I imagine that you'll probably show up to that call more confident that you have in any other cell call, even though it's the highest, like, have you ever sold any one thing for $100,000 for yourself?
01:24:15 - Seth Ellsworth
Um, I sold a website for 220.
01:24:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm about like this service something.
01:24:22 - Seth Ellsworth
No.
01:24:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, selling a website or business is a whole different thing. This is selling you as a service, um, doing this particular thing that there's been a lot of, well, just a huge lack of clarity and confidence. So going into this success way is a big deal. But I, your confidence seems to be growing and the clarity growing almost daily, definitely weekly. And I think that you have the potential just to go in and knock it out of the park Friday.
01:24:58 - Seth Ellsworth
Thank you. I was just saying, I think we can ROI these guys before we even build anything.
01:25:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Build anything before we build anything. Well, I don't know how, how you would do that without doing something. What do you mean? Well, I mean, before we build the experience, just, okay, don't say anything and then say the experience, but yeah, build that thing like just with a few tweaks, maybe you say that, but the language matters very much because that's almost like we can get your money back without doing anything. That's what it sounds like.
01:25:42 - Seth Ellsworth
Okay. that's not what I'm.
01:25:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So anyway, so like you could say something like where I think we can ROI just by making a few actually simple tweaks that we can implement into your system within a couple of days. that can start, you know, getting you money while we're building the big thing. The language is different, it takes more, but it's factual, and it's clear. You know it's clear because it's reflected as email, you know, and improved this type of thing, and that doesn't take a lot of effort. But that clarity makes a big difference because when you're not there, you create confusion. Confusion creates friction. Friction slows down sales. You don't want any confusion. You don't want any friction. So be very clear when you say anything on the call.
01:26:39 - Seth Ellsworth
Cool. right.
01:26:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
definitely have to go. Let's keep working this out. Work on the two different offers and send over what you got when you got it.
01:26:50 - Seth Ellsworth
Yeah. Thank you much.
01:26:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. You're welcome. Good talk. Talk to you soon.
01:26:54 - Seth Ellsworth
Bye.

Whoa.
00:00:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't have a orientation. Oh my gosh. Did you hear what Siri just said? I know. First of all, it's not always muted. I was talking to you guys, seeing if you can hear me. And then that said, uh huh. And I said, I wasn't talking to you. And she says, I don't have a orientation. I'm like, what? Okay. Yeah.
00:00:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, that's no, I guess.
00:00:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. How are you guys today?
00:01:04 - Patrick Shahverdian
Pretty good?
00:01:06 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Pretty good. Patrick's having a killer month.
00:01:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah? Let's go look at that. Tell me about it.
00:01:18 - Patrick Shahverdian
Just a lot of supplements and cases closed out them. Which is good. Big ones, small ones. team is doing everything that they're supposed to be doing. Yep. Some, a little bit of good timing. A lot of, you know, everyone doing their tasks. So It's super enthusiastic about it, I think. Well, the team, they got to do it the next month, right?
00:01:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yes. Yeah. Um, let's see, let's update this and then I want for this month. Okay, that is a good month. Um, now remind me though, wait a minute, gross attorney fees, average attorney fees, okay. Laura, you're not doing too bad, huh?
00:02:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Uh, yeah, the fees, the money in is a little worried about the settlements though. It's uh, I had a bunch of different, well, a bunch, maybe like two or three big ones are supposed to come in this month and they got delayed, so hopefully get a better
00:03:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
seven months next month that I like to be I like to be in the 700 that's that's where I know I can make I can get some good distributions just again reporting question of the mark what is your targets like does mark have an incentive target for settlements specifically just putting us against each other and competing for bragging rights okay so but it's not tied in your sense of it's just um the total attorney fees right yeah that's correct okay so all right well why would you focus on settlements then uh because i'm thinking ahead so whatever settlements i have drive how much it makes up yes i have to think about the the separation of it so yeah the indicator that that's what's coming got it okay so you track that don't you want to spreadsheet the settlements well not anymore now that it's posted on the on the report what report and i'll show you
00:05:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, can I share my screen real quick?
00:05:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:05:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
This one.
00:05:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Settlement. Okay.
00:05:24 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. Okay.
00:05:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
did you, did that report change for you or?
00:05:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:05:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So he updated something, which didn't tell me. That's good.
00:05:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I mentioned it earlier this month and he said that report is not always accurate. So he goes off of what's posted on the Slack channel for settlement selection. But this is. You know, I know my numbers are accurate in here, which is really what I care the most about.
00:06:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I'm glad. Okay. So you guys have access to that report. So let me go into that report.
00:06:19 - Patrick Shahverdian
You don't care about my numbers.
00:06:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I mean, I'm glad you're doing good, but I'm not fine.
00:06:29 - Patrick Shahverdian
Don't worry. Take next month.
00:06:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like this better than quiet.
00:06:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Come on, let's go.
00:06:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There you go. There you go. There you go. Fuel that fire. Everybody wins when we all try to win. Let's see. It's amount. And. Where's here? Oh, Lauren's, you were already sharing that, but where's Patrick? Patrick, are you looking at this report? Regularly, or at all?
00:07:21 - Patrick Shahverdian
Um, I have my own list for my cases. But periodically Mark will just tell us kind of where everybody's at.
00:07:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have any interest in looking at it?
00:07:36 - Patrick Shahverdian
Oh, yeah, it was good to know. But like he said, sometimes they're like really. Not accurate, so.
00:07:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, I think all it is is. Whether the dates are correct. So. I'd have to check on it, but I would think. I mean, let me ask this like I think one time you said the met page not calculated in there. Oh Okay mine is It is I had a met be Settle yesterday for 5,000 and there it is right here I would imagine it's close enough that it gives you a good idea And that it's worth looking at Cuz it's let's see It shows you Settlement five hundred and thirty seven seven thousand seven fifty No, that's for the third party. I actually have a 23 Okay, okay, I see the third party.
00:08:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
What's the third party?
00:09:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
uh defendants so as this is uh my settle against defendant first party is what they have uh under under insured coverage or insured coverage okay it's all right so then let me go look at and then clearance by 18 okay so i see what you're looking at and focusing on i understand a lot of it is the the timing and these are things that you've been working on for a few months it'll be really interesting to see i don't know the average amount of time for a case to settle what is that that that's what um goodbye to the t-forms. wonder actually goodbye to reports settled. We have a few different dashboards that were created and trying to figure out which one I don't know what. Unless the thing I can't, at heart's resolution speed but team. We're still waiting on the guy that's doing this. the guy that helps us with the reports, this is not his main job. It's kind of his side gig. Just this time here equals this month. And those numbers are getting so much better though. So people are making sure there's nothing here that, okay, let me show the screen. So this is just for this month, but it can only count the cases that have closed or resolved. it's during the month. So this is the thing we're working on to check it but we have been watching this number and they're definitely shrinking and yours are just skewed Patrick I can't even don't even know at what point these were are going to be legitimate but do you see where yours are now Lorenz. So that speed should mean that the well depending on how good your cases are getting worked up and how good they have the potential anyway your settlement fees should be increasing because your unless your case volume goes down the speed of resolution is improving so as long as your volume is not going down then the sentiment amount should go up. Does that make sense numbers-wise?
00:13:02 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:13:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you get the same amount of cases, but they're settling quicker, you're getting to the money quicker. So just by virtue of that, the settlement amount should increase because you're getting the money faster. This we're still figuring out. And this doesn't include when it's the one-third when you're not targeting 40%. So we're working on fixing that also. And I'm just going to go with last quarter so we can look at this resolution speed by team right here. Yeah, that's- I'm improving a lot, so let's go back to report attorney fees this month. I wonder if I'm going to get in trouble if I do something I shouldn't do, but wonder if I can make a copy of it. I would think that that makes a copy. Oh, I have the dashboard. I'm going to make people mad. It's okay. for given I want this settlement amount. Yes. Let's see what I want and I want it this way, we'll just add default resolution between the Anyway, I want to bother you guys with that. So, let's get back to what we were working on. You guys remember the assignments? Great, this is October 21st. All right. So I'm going to copy this and let's see. I'm going to a new new. Let's see. All right. All right. I'm going to get here. Sorry, I'm moving. Okay. so. Make sure and post this at the end of call each week. And that way you guys can have one central location and it's not in. No, to go back to. So I would recommend bookmarking this doing it right now. Perfect. Crittle Lisk in Slack during soccer practice on Thursday night. I think that was the other ones.
00:18:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, that was like our little journal entries.
00:18:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, right. So that was what let's see scheduled and the week meeting with Jessica discuss her return and performance and transition for Karen to assist Jessica with case management. John's return, right? Those are things you're talking about preparer. Ideas for process improvements, automation. Okay. Yeah, we'll work for organizations next meeting. need to follow up with Mark. Mark, is terrible about getting things done on the timeline. Oh, where did it go? Opened up questioning it. Opened up a new email when I lost it. Way too new. There it is. I'm going it You You I know that he wasn't going to be able get that right away. forgot about like the crazy travel schedule he had. So I think that's done. I think he said somewhere around the end of the month. So we'll see what we can do about getting the workflow going. Automations. Sorry. With LITIFY, I'm sorry, team performance take notes issues. proud to discuss that. next meeting. That was something that I asked you guys to do throughout the week. That was the homework.
00:21:06 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yes.
00:21:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you remember that Patrick?
00:21:11 - Patrick Shahverdian
No.
00:21:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so this will help. This is something I wanted you to do, keep that. That was what the journal entry was about is to notice anything that's going great. Anything that's going less than ideal and needs to be improved upon. So average doesn't really need to be noted per se, the outlier type things. If something's great, we want to pay attention to that and see if it's something that we can get more of. I want to make sure that we celebrate that if somebody's doing a great job. But also, is that something that could be trained and shown to other people? if somebody's doing great job. So we're just noticing and paying attention. So obviously there's improvements that are happening. We want to be able to know specifically where the improvements are happening. Who's doing it, what are they doing, right? Because we're talking about lot of things and we're implementing different things. We wanna know what's actually getting us the results. So rather than just, yeah, our numbers are looking better, these are some of the things that we're doing. Can you draw a specific correlation to what we're doing that's making the biggest difference? Does that make sense?
00:22:37 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah, I did put something in the journal, is that what you're referring to?
00:22:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, did I create one and share it with you or not? Okay, I should have it up and then I probably don't. What's the, somebody drop it in the chat after me. There it is. Okay. Okay, got it. Um, good. So we'll keep the homework one separate. Um, we have 10. Okay, perfect. So I'm going to pull these like you guys to pull the name and date. Let me go ahead. Here's another thing that you can do when you type your notes. Can you type at Tina, a profit driving, it'll, it'll populate. That way I get a notification that you've updated it. Please and thank you. You want to give it a try, both of you guys so that we can make sure that you know how it works and I've got that muscle memory and then I can get it. Please. You know what I mean, Patrick?
00:24:08 - Patrick Shahverdian
If I put, oh, it'll give you a notification.
00:24:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so where it says Patrick week of 10, 15, 22. At the end of that, put at. And then Tina. should pop up my name. And then I should, there you go. So what that will do is trigger an email for me. And let me know that I've got something to review. So anytime you guys leave a note or an update journal entry, whatever. I'll get that notification. And even this guy's, this is a simple system. It's a very simple system. We keep journal entries. Number one, that's the system in and of itself. The nuance to it is that both of you are in there, that you put a date, that you notice what is great or what needs work, and that you tag me. All of those things are part of the system. So, and I'm telling you that so that you think about systems in a very basic way. But what that allows us to do is have more effective meetings, because you're, first of all, you're thinking about things throughout the week, but you're taking note of them as they happen. And also making sure that I get notified so that I'm called back to what we're working on throughout the week. And you know how we talked about mental lag time, know, like why you want a time block instead of just check email all throughout the day. It's because of mental lag time. So, if we're only thinking about the things that we're working on together once a week when we meet. We have to recall everything that we've been talking about, and that takes a little time. So we kind of have to rehash everything, whereas if we're coming back to this document of the things that we're working on a few times a week, then it stays fresh on our minds so that when we come to the call, we are already focused on what's happening. And we don't have to spend so much time and effort recalling, does that make sense? Okay, cool. So now let me look at this. I love that, Lorenz, that you're reviewing the operational improvement every morning and seeing whether not it's had an effect on the KPIs. So which KPIs are you looking at specifically?
00:26:52 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Settlements, and these, and then time. I'm open to close.
00:27:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Perfect. So you're looking at that stuff daily.
00:27:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Not necessarily daily, but like every other day or so.
00:27:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think honestly weekly is plenty. Just get your stats. Otherwise I feel like it's a little bit too obsessive. You could be doing it. The things aren't going to change that much in the course of a week. So that time will be better spent somewhere else managing it. know what I mean? Like the fact that you're reviewing the cases. Twice, let's see, going through all of the cases twice in a month now versus once every few weeks, you know, that's a big difference. All right. And Patrick, drink for our view, know. The implementation of stopping lean treatment, once we identify, I know, defendant insurance, am on a, on the shirt runners. Okay. On a police report or a finding insurance is taking too long. Those implementation of stopping lean treatment. So, I don't understand the lean's, um, how, how that works.
00:28:26 - Patrick Shahverdian
So, can you elaborate for this a little bit? Yeah. So, basically, when we treat the clients on lean treatment, which means, you know, the doctors in our net work that are going to get paid from a settlement, want to be careful to make sure that there is insurance coverage before we have them treat with those doctors, because if there ends up not being any insurance or a settlement, then they kind of get burned.
00:28:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The doctor gets burned?
00:28:56 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah. Okay. Whereas, if the client treats on health insurance, If there is a settlement that you know will reimburse the health insurance But if there ends up not being any then the health insurance does the job and just pays for it anyways So it's a safer way to Make sure that we're not having the doctors that are network treat clients that they're not going to end up getting paid on So the way that your Language is do you discover that somebody on your team noticed this and implemented it? No, I noticed that on some of these cases where We're not finding insurance or the police report indicates There may not be insurance that the case manager is putting those clients on a health insurance treatment Until we can find insurance, which is a good thing. So it's so the doctors You know, we're not having these doctors treat clients that are at a risk of potentially no insurance being found So you saw something good that you didn't know was happening I did notice before like they would just set up with lean treatment while we were looking for insurance, but that's kind of a risky game that you're playing. So I let them know like if we get a case and it looks like a good case as far as injuries and things like that, we can do lean treatment, but just keep it very minimal. But you know, we're searching for insurance for like a week, two weeks, and nothing's coming back to proactively switch them to health insurance that way that doctor's not going to accrue this high bill.
00:30:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Lorenz, how does your team handle that?
00:30:41 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Pretty much the same. We can't review the cases if we, you know, especially in Tucson, Tucson cases take a long time to get the TCR police report. Okay, but it might be a little bit. different here, though, because we have, well, all but one provider, really, understand that, you know, every time they take a case on a lean, there is a bit of a risk involved, and they they've been doing this long enough, that they don't mind getting burned once in a while, just because they know that we're usually going to pay them in full anyway, for the other cases. So, like, for example, we have, I had lunch with one of my providers last month, and he basically said, look, know, I charge, if you were to walk into my clinic, I charge 40 bucks per session. Okay. On a lean, I can charge $120 per session for the same amount of work. So, if a client comes in and we just want, we don't have liability established yet. don't want to gap, just haven't come in, we'll treat on a lean and if liability doesn't get accepted, then, you know, that's fine. I can eat the past because on the other clients, I make three times as much as I would if they have just walked in. And so he's been doing it for 30 years, he knows how this works. But then we have like other providers like Dr. Kim, who wants to be paid in full no matter what. And that one, we have to be a little bit more careful. Absolutely.
00:32:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you have to handle providers on a case by case basis?
00:32:39 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, and I try to keep my providers pretty happy. Like I'm, I'm going to go to a son's game with a couple of them in Mark, next week, I think, just to, you know, put some face time in with them and make sure their our team is meeting their expectation.
00:32:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many providers? do you think you have total or like the preferred ones that we we both so preferred ones probably about 10 or 15 okay uh total well that depends honestly because you know if you don't health insurance too and i don't know i don't know anyone personally like banner and stuff but when you say preferred what percentage of the business is in your preferred network um over 50 percent i'd say i still have a big gap what i'm wondering is do you notate the preferences do you do you have any kind of record of sorting and keeping track of your providers that preferences how they behave
00:34:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, we all know them. mean, we have my cell phone number. I have theirs. Usually, we have a relationship, but like as far as like a word document or an Excel spreadsheet where I keep track of all my interactions with them.
00:34:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I mean, at some point, they're new, right? And at some point, you don't know everything about them. And the ability, like, okay, so let me ask you this point. Question, when was the last time you got a new provider?
00:34:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, last month, it's called precision integrative care. We have a couple of clients with them and actually my wife did injections with them on Friday and uh how's she feeling by the way? Worse. They gave her a ketamine and she's uh she had a really bad trip and they basically they're not a preferred provider anymore. I have some godfather vibes coming up out of me right now like one in the go have a conversation for you. Yeah well she didn't realize I thought the owner of the clea the stuff was fine but the owner of the clinic was the one and so she like put us in the parking lot to so that she wouldn't be too loud for the other patients and the biggest red flag of red flags yeah and then you will sweep uh something like that under the rug knowing that those allergic reactions can turn into something better later because they can keep developing yeah that's terrifying and i wouldn't want to be associated with them at all that's what's the word not um that's negligence medical negligence yeah well i mean fortunately there's no adverse long-term adverse effects so that was good but yeah i get you know she was like well once you give me your numbers so that i can check up on your wife later today you know as we're in the parking lot and you know i thought i assumed she knew who i who i was because her staff did and uh i gave her my card and that's when like She went from like, oh crap, you know, she was, I could see in her eyes that she realized she messed up.
00:37:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you talk to her boss about that?
00:37:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, she's the owner of that clinic, but she's part of the network with someone, one of the doctors I get, he's a chiropractor. He has his own network here in Arizona. He refers a lot of PI cases from us to different providers. And so I'm going to be talking to him later this week.
00:37:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, did you talk to Mark about it?
00:37:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I told him in passing that Carrie was like, because I had to take off and go pick her up from the office. And so he knows what happened, but I don't know if he knows it's one of the hard. for providers or one of the providers I was trying to establish relationship with, I should say.
00:38:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I just mean because everything about who you refer out is impact, sweet, law, reputation. you know, that's word. Yes, yes. I mean, yeah, we got terrible on so many fronts, so I hope Carrie feels better soon. I know it's been...
00:38:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, it was a big deal for her, actually, because she's from Portland, so you know, doctors are not high on her priority list, and so it was a big deal for her to be able to like go and get some medical treatment, as opposed to being person.
00:38:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then they just talks her out of it forever.
00:38:47 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, she's done.
00:38:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's not. Oh, I'm like, I will figure out everything on my own, but I live in Oregon, so you know, little great here. Okay, so, Anyway, before that, what was the last time you got a new provider?
00:39:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, we got Dr. Utas back in June, I think.
00:39:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so it's not a frequent, over like changing thing. I just wanted to make sure this just it for so we're all on the same page going back to Patrick's conversation about the weans and how we're handling that that some people some providers might actually not care if you stop and you switch to healthcare because they're they're basically playing the game going the odds are in their favor that they'll get more if it is lean treatment that they'll eat the cost. So maybe part of the process is what is your preference here? What do you think about that?
00:39:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I have some providers honestly. I don't know if it's the same in Arizona but in California, but there's a lot of chiropractors here that will not deal with health insurance at all. They only do treatment or cash services. That may be different once you get to ortho or PM, but caros that we work with, they usually don't work with insurance.
00:40:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, Patrick, just because this is some new ish to you, the new wants of all of these things, and it's even there were to me because I don't do your job, so this is just a conversation trying to facilitate, you know, what's the process. So, the whole thing came about because you realized somebody was handling it. particular, it seems like a good idea, but it also seems like a nuanced thing rather than a cut and done. I hate if it's been a couple of weeks and we still don't have insurance, cut it off and switch it to health insurance. Now that that is part of the caveat, Lorenz, do you have a time period or and how many how many doctors do you think prefer because of that the the leans do I would imagine pay all of the doctors more? What do you have a percentage where you think that more of them would prefer to just go ahead and eat the cost on occasion?
00:41:33 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I know most of my caras are not set up for health insurance. one and number two, only about 50% of my clients even have health insurance.
00:41:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is most of the work that happens, Kairos.
00:41:52 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Depends. So if it depends on what the injuries are, so there's two in a row, Chiro's and MRI always happen no matter what okay 99% of the cases and our MRI is going to Hospitals cuz like I live in small town. That's the only place that's gonna happen. Do you guys have clinics to do MRI's? We have clinics that will do MRI's on a lean okay, and Once we have the MRI results the chiro decides, you know whether the client is Is A good candidate for pain management or if it's if the MRI is negative then the adjuster is never gonna pay for pain management If there's nothing showing on the MRI Did mine not even pay for the MRI at that point, but so okay, so the chiropractor is cuz I'm trying to Narrow the conversation down to this process specifically around leans versus health insurance um But if you know if it's only the
00:43:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
or fractures that prefer leans over health insurance because they're not dealing with it, so not one specific kind of nuance that maybe is new information for you, Patrick, or not.
00:43:12 - Patrick Shahverdian
I don't know. No, this is like what I'm saying is like this is how Mark trains us to run these cases. What I know just is that my case manager is consciously thinking about this when we're getting new cases because it's so easy for them to, you know, just look at our map. Oh, there's this Cairo here, let's set them up. Whereas it takes more time to be like, okay, let me look at the police report. Let me look at, you know, these things to see because you can kind of gauge whether there's likely going to be coverage or not.
00:43:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like if it's a hit and run or something like that.
00:43:43 - Patrick Shahverdian
Right. not going to be coverage, but, you know, we still try, you know, as our due diligence to try, but I'm happy to see that they're consciously thinking about, okay, let me, because it shows that they care. about the cases, because it's so easy to just throw it in the treatment system and let's get the ball rolling, but to stop and say, okay, maybe I should do this on the health insurance, so we don't burn a doctor, but the client can still treat. So that's why I put it in here, because I was happy to see that, you know, L.C. is taking the time to think about the cases before, as opposed to just throwing it in the system and getting things rolling.
00:44:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's awesome. Okay, so one thing that we can do is maybe be a little bit more specific in the language, who's doing it, what's good about it. Not just what the observation is, but why it's important, why it's good, or something's bad, like why we're concerned about it, because otherwise I'm going to ask a question.
00:44:48 - Patrick Shahverdian
Sorry, that was very vague that I put in there.
00:44:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's okay, but it's all a learning process, and I probably could have asked different questions, but that's the way the my brain works is online. Let's go around then. So, all right, good. Let me see. After the run string power view, a parent that the list functions in Slack, takes too long to set up, and slows down the power view process. Need to take time outside hours to set up list for each file. What was the status of that? Is it actually a helpful process or just more time than it's worth?
00:45:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I was going to do it. And then last Tuesday, you said you were setting something up.
00:45:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm not.
00:45:35 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I said, if something else is going to happen, I'm not going to spend, you know, that's good. It's been hours to.
00:45:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's right. No, because the whole thing, when I talked to Mark about it, he was like, well, that's the whole thing about letify. It's supposed to be able to do all of this. And I'm like, and does it? And how many years have you used it and have you trade your team? And I got crickets. So we're going to have.
00:46:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
call about that yeah uh okay so and then let's see if more than one person speaks to the client about continuing treatment rather than closing it out clients is more likely to keep treating than to push for immediate settlement care so it's another thing of um second care kind of huh second yeah um you know it's uh noticing that a lot of cases though came from uh jessica uh you know she was like I talked to them because they're Spanish speakers so I can't talk to them myself directly uh a lot of them said you know I just care about PD I don't care about my case I just want to get my car fixed and so they ended up with like six thousand dollars in medical treatment and which is not enough to to get even a minimal policy here in Arizona and so I was trying to figure it out ways we can kind of help them understand that there's, they are still hurt and that in order to resolve those injuries, they need to do additional treatment, which will yield better results for their legal case. And I think Jessica has a little bit maybe shy and asserting and having that honest conversation with the clients. And so, but when Jessica was gone, Karen went through those cases and she was able to convince 50% of those clients that were ready for, that were supposedly ready for demand, she was able to convince them to go back to treatment, to take care of their injuries and increase the value. And so, I discussed it when Jessica came back. Mike has a bit of an ego. He didn't like the idea of Karen coming in and taking his clients over, so he decided he was going to do that and second voicing some of those clients. And he got a little bit of success doing it himself. So I think it's revealing the second voice principle that it can be helpful, especially with those clients who want to wrap things up. I think oftentimes, honestly, they don't know. They say, I've got to go back to work. I can't afford taking all this time off of work. And we have options for that. We have telemedicine. We have people that can treat them on Saturday after work hours, whenever it's convenient for them. And I don't know that they understood that that was an option.
00:48:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that makes me think, and this. This has come up with intake too, but do you have, so we talked a little bit about scripting and maybe creating a list of objections for each of the points, right? So if there's objections to treatment, how do we handle those objections? If they say this or something like it, respond with this. If they say this or something like it, respond with this. But the other thing I think that you might do is if somebody on your team has to do something and they are weak at it and it's conversational, what about role-playing? What about just giving them practice and there's a lot, it's muscle memory, you know? the muscle memory is not going to come, they don't do it in the first place and they're not going to do it in the first place. If they don't feel safe enough to do it, so if they're wrong. playing in a place where they feel safe, then they just get practiced. Then it becomes kind of rope memory and muscle memory at the same time. I imagine that there's resistance, shyness, whatever it is, but regardless, it's a real thing. Muscle memory is a real thing. That practice is a real thing. It takes out nervousness. think about driving, and I think that we have this conversation. I can never remember who I've talked about the driving analogy before, but everything that you have to think about is nerve-wracking and stressful. Do I turn my blinker on? Where the heck is my blinker? Where's the clutch? Where's the right? okay, nobody does clutch anymore, but I did, and it was hard.
00:50:55 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, the M3 is stick still, right?
00:51:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to have a manual car, no electronics, but like souped up so it can do all the things, but also EMP can come and I'm still going. I don't care. live in a crazy world. love technology, but also the technology be crazy. I ain't having no Terminator come at me. Okay. But anyway, mostly it's just a fun excuse to have something that's like fun and retro, but I won't my like if you're at a four-way intersection and it's just a stop sign and two people got there at the same time. Who goes first? Like even if it's a green light and you're like in somebody's opposite of you, do you go? Is your green light being yield? Is there an arrow? You know what I mean? Like there's so many things you have to process and it's terrifying at first and you make a mistake because everybody makes a mistake and you're like the way you find out that was a mistake is because you almost got hit and it's terrifying and there's Anxiety and then one day you look back and you're like you don't have to think about any of it because you know how it goes Unless you come to my town and there's these weird like one-way streets that I go backwards and you always run into somebody Doesn't know that it's a one-way street and they're coming at you. It's great. Anyway But my point is is that the anxiety and that conversation and the discomfort so there's two aspects of it One of it is if they feel like they're doing something that is not in the best interest of the client so if they have a moral dilemma with Pushing towards treatment You first have to overcome the moral dilemma that has nothing to do with practice if they feel like it's manipulation or whatever then you have to address that and and so Number one is the way that I would approach that is We all know that the injuries aren't always apparent, they can be revealed down the road, but they have a better chance of being covered if, you know, they got sufficient treatment in the beginning. But also, sometimes people have such a high threshold for pain that they're just not really aware that they're suffering, additionally, and the doctors are going to help pull that out of That's the truth. When you're a person who's just like, I got work to do, I got work to do, I got work to do, you can be hurting all day long, you just like deal with it, you know, so those are the kind of people will be like, whatever, I'm going to deal with it, but they don't understand sometimes the impact that that can have long-term down the road. You have a slip disc and you're working on it, keep working on it, keep working on it, what's going to happen. You're not able to work anymore, and that window has closed. So, in terms of dealing with the moral dilemmas, The more care that you get after this, probably the better overall to make sure that everything's been covered, right? And that you're taking care of and it's worth it. So then the practice, though, I just kind of lost my train of thought for a second. The other thing about it, and this may not feel like it's in the benefit of the clients, but it's in the benefit of all clients. So, Sweet Law doesn't get paid unless the client gets paid. If there are no fees, there's no payment, that business can't stay in business. So if Sweet Law's not around to take care of them, they've got to go to somebody else, and not everybody is going to take as good a care of them as you guys will. We know that. We've seen the reviews. We know that. Also Sweet Law's out of business. So, knowing that, making sure that everybody gets maximum treatment, one. is the best protection for them. And number two is the best protection for sweet love. There's no reason not to do that. It ultimately it helps everybody in the long run. But then the other part would just be practice. And so I would really consider maybe you do it for distributions, negotiations, anything where you've got to talk somebody into doing something that there's some pushback on. If there's a person on your team having that type of conversation and they're not awesome at it, I would practice some role playing and be like let's get better at this. So what I want you guys to think about this week is where does that show up in the business? Who is maybe not so strong at those types of conversations where the outcome requires an agreement from anybody else whether it's the insurance? Maybe it's just dealing with insurance providers better. Maybe it's dealing with the clients, but maybe it's a different aspects of the case, different points in the case. Whatever that is, think about where there's a little bit of friction, and it's because somebody's holding back. Bring that, put it in your notes in your journal. And let's come up with a plan for how we can create some scenarios where you can kind of role play and help them get a little bit more confident at it. And think about a time first before you buy it, like it doesn't do it good if you don't buy into it. But think about a time when you did this, where you practice saying something that you were like, I don't know how to handle this, right? don't know, maybe it's just being an attorney yourself, maybe it's just going through certain types of things. The thing that comes in my mind is the dare program. Like that came out when I was a kid, grade, I was probably the first one. And we did. role-playing, we practice saying no to drugs. That's stupid, like saying no to peer pressure, whatever. But it created this muscle memory. you, you had to use the words that never would have come out of your mouth at any other time. So when the time came to say it, you're like, I know what those words are. I've spoken them before. They've come out of my mouth before. I can say them now. And so anyway, just, don't know what, Lorenz, did you start my mission?
00:57:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:57:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I would like to talk to you about our one thing, Jesus Christ. You probably have some practice with that, huh? Knocking on doors?
00:57:39 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I'm not afraid.
00:57:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not how we go about it. But there are some things you know that you have to do. There was a United Way fundraiser thing that we did in my call center, my corporate life, like almost 30 years ago. And When I figured out that the thing to say to people was, you can buy X for this person for less than a cup of coffee or less than a two meter bottle or whatever, I got yes, and I won the competition. I raised the most money and my boss had to die her very long, beautiful hair and ugly seaweed green. And my other boss got his head shaved. I loved it. So anyway, not competitive or vindictive or spiteful or anything. Don't cross me. I'm just kidding. Anyways, think about it because look, your guys, all of you care about doing a good job. The systems, even role playing, it's just how things are going, that's a system. It's a systematic approach, right? the strategy is, okay, now that I've seen this through my... Systematic observation. What am I going to do to improve it? Everybody can improve Practice makes perfect, right? That's what we're told. So where are they going to get the practice? Well, it's not really practice if nobody's watching and critiquing and Offering feedback about how you can do better in real time, right? If you don't get the feedback It's it's kind of like well, okay, I did the thing, but I don't really know to do it good Could I have done it better? So let's make sure that we build that into into the day not day to day, but like overall kind of operations Because I think I think it'll make a difference and remember if we get a little lift here and a little lift there and a little lift here, know what I mean? Then it has a compounding effect and That should it should mean better results for everybody Okay, so don't forget, set up some sort of reminders so that you remember just to kind of be thinking about this at the end of each day and kind of review mentally what stood out to you if anything, and maybe at the beginning of the day also so that you remind yourself to be observant and watch out for these things, and eventually we'll get to be able to talk to the litify people and see what we can do for workflows and automations, but in the meantime keep doing what you guys are doing because the stats are improving, you're clearly making a difference, and it's all coming from the way that you're approaching stuff, so good job.

Hello, is this thing on?
00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is this thing on? Yes. Where's my volume? My kids are working on the. It's evil for us and they're very noisy. So I had to be somewhere else. They're on my left.
00:00:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)

00:00:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Dan is walking to work right now. Walking to work. Okay. Getting the in. Now I walk a couple of times a week. It's just easier. How far is the office? 14 minutes. So would I know the actual distance walking it's 14 minutes. Yeah, it's like, yeah, around 14 15 minutes.
00:01:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's nice.
00:01:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Depending on my pace.
00:01:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good. When did you start doing that?
00:01:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, well, I'm talking about it. Since everyone's been driving.
00:01:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
little bit, huh? Yes. You didn't start driving right away though, did she?
00:01:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, she got her license last October. Listen to that. Yeah, so she held off. So actually she had to wait. So she got her license like October 10 or something. So soon after that. But I, you know, walked in a couple of times in between whatever reason.
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
at that, like, moderate climate so that you could walk frequently.
00:02:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh my god, this is covering that with Mario. Like, you don't understand how you are. Wait till you go somewhere else.
00:02:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, that is the being about existence right now. crazy weather.
00:02:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yeah, it's actually hot here today. But like for fear, which is not really hot.
00:02:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, what is it?
00:02:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I don't know.
00:02:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would say it's the 80s. I I'm going to look at a brand name. I get cold in the 80s. like it in the 90s. I'm happy in the hundreds.
00:02:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I'm worried about that or the whopping 70 for it.
00:02:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, oh, that's hot for here.
00:02:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That is hilarious. That is hilarious. Um, how where have you gotten on the Marsha stuff? I'm like halfway through another one. Start the wrong one. So I'm gonna try to wrap it up today and start another one. This one's going sort of quick, so it's not. Yeah, so this is still like planning, understanding like it's like deeper into the planning portion of the framework, which is good. So I was like, I'm just gonna go through it all, just to don't miss anything. But yeah, like halfway through. Probably like six more videos, but these ones are all fairly short.
00:03:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And what are we doing? Good. What have you like, have you had any aha since last week?
00:03:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Is Dashboards like this? yesterday. His dashboards are sick. I'm oh my god, they're so good. So he'll make like, he's big into Ikea. It's information, questions, actions. And then he has this other thing that he calls eyes on the journey. So the journey would be like a sales page, right? So he his argument is that there's a journey on the sales page. It's broken up into three eyes. So eyes on the journey is like a little too far. So it's like interest, no, impression, interest, interaction, something, something. And what he does is he sets different events for each. guy. So impressions, super simple page view, and then interest might be, they scroll 50%, and then the next one, it's not what I thought, but that won't be, they hit, they saw the pricing table, and they were there for 10 seconds or whatever. So he was firing these events for each of those things, and then he has like a visual funnel in Looker Studio of that page, and those steps of the funnel with like a breakdown of, hey, X percent did this I, then this I, then this I, and then that's on the right hand side, and then on left hand side, it's all the metrics broken out, so that you see like, oh, your conversion to interest, you had a hundred visitors in your conversion to interest walls. 12% of whatever it is, so that's all correct because you're supposed to be forecasting that already, right? That's part of your plan. Part of your plan is okay, you're either gathering the data and saying these are my baselines and then you're going to try to beat those. That's basically where I'm going to be at. So you just set all this stuff up and start capturing and then recording and learning. Like, hey, these are, this is my opt-in rate right now. Well, if I increase that, the action would be like, I want to increase my opt-in rates. Okay, great. this is what it is. What are you going to do? the action we're going to take, and then what's the outcome that's affecting. But he does that for multiple journeys. So there's like the sales page journey, the cart journey, the opt-in journey, the membership side journey. See, it's all these different... dashboards set up and they look fantastic I'd love to see those so Andy gives Andy gives to you he's like here's all the graphics here's how you build them but I've got no part I showed them to someday they were like oh my God who is this?
00:07:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
oh yeah I'll show you yeah I can give you access to the course to it that's the thing about being the type of people that we are that kind of necessarily are jacks of all trades like we get into some stuff but you can't do all the things really well all the time but when you're meeting the business you have to do a lot of different things like so for example split testing heat maps using split testing software like improved or what was the other one huh yeah visual Yes, so those are things that I used to do and set up and then ended up with, so I was doing them in coffee shop millionaire, well, what year is it, 13 years ago? Or before, a little bit before that, and then the, so that was Anthony Trister, and then Manish Punjabi, which nobody really knows. known kind of behind the scenes like you. And then so Manish and I were working on split testing stuff and he ended up partnering with Justin Christensen and they created conversion fanatics and I was working with them in the beginning. So that was like stuff I did a ton. On the same time I met Mercer was speaking at a little tiny mastermind event by this guy named Jared Elvitch who's also very like hush-hush but was like a mentor to Ryan Lee. The what do you call it? I don't know almost like incestuous bar. Oh yeah early days. Yeah but this so like when I ask you numbers and data and stuff like that I we only spend an hour together week that's the one thing that I kind of miss in being in the businesses more is having more time to really like look at data, set up the systems that capture the data. You don't really, you don't have an optimizer. And especially now, I think, I almost think that that's a role that everybody everybody should have it. But after, you know, at least one million, but probably more in the two four million kind of optimizing. Obviously, you can get there better. But I'm also thinking about the logistics of how many things there are to manage in a business and how much skill a person has when they're first getting to that, you know, even just breaking that six figure mark. There's a whole level of understanding difference between finally getting to that threshold and finally getting to the seven bigger threshold in terms of comprehension of the not nuances, but the facets of business and online business. And then just getting into the next level of it. So to the point of like, you wanting to increase your market share one percent and having determined how much that is being at the, you know, between three and four million spending time doing this, if this was the main thing you accomplish this whole year, is having a system like a really solid optimization system for all of these aspects, right? So there's the landing page, the checkout page, which sometimes is the same depending on what you built it with. Um, if there's an order bump, but then even the thank you page and the download page, which you've been diving into are people even getting their downloads, that type of thing. There is so much, you can't optimize what you don't know to, right?
00:11:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Literally, I was just going to say and people tried to do it all the time. Yeah. Yeah. Like he calls it, he was calling it like he runs into people all the time. And he's called it the curse of a good offer. So that guy's getting offered a throw. up and they throw it on Facebook and they're spending 500 and they're getting a thousand. And they spend a thousand and they're getting two thousand. It's like, then they're like, oh, we got it. Then they spend 10,000 and they get nothing. And they're like, wait a minute. Something broke. They don't know where to look because they were never looking. So, yeah, that's true. So, I don't have that problem. The problem that I have is that I'm not talking the thing. I don't know where new customers come from, but that's my problem. And that's my also the solution to my other problem is how do I get more market share new customers? How do I get new customers? don't know. If I sell one the second, then I can try to sell the first.
00:12:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So, well. keep digging in.
00:13:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh yeah, I just got I got some stuff I'm gonna wait for Mushy to do some stuff. I'm usually soft change her API so he's writing a bunch of our legacy custom code that we have and then when he's done with that he's gonna help me do this custom stuff that I figured out but I just got to wait for him to give me the high sign which could be like a little bit too but I should be further along. Good thing is going through these courses I haven't been like oh I'm doing it wrong where I'm coming.
00:13:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You haven't been doing it wrong but because you do keep getting muffled in and out and like garbled.
00:13:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Just that I haven't changed I know the thing right it's like I need to figure out where new customers come from.
00:13:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think that's going to change. And they're and I don't know the answer so Now I might be surprised by the answer How much time do you figure you've been able to spend each week on this stuff on the Marshall stuff on just yeah At least six eight I don't even know how to like I've got kind of double questions in my head, which is Do you have any desire to increase or maintain that pace and at that pace? At what point do you think you'll be done at least getting through more stuff and are you building as you're going through it?
00:14:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Are you just absorbing? There's been nothing to build yet. There's been no You hold method. That's next. I think next you go in and you actually set up Google Analytics 4. So I think that's going to be me going in, watching all this stuff just to see that I miss anything, right? For instance, he talks about cross domain tracking. I know I used to have that in GA. I do not know if it's in GA 4. I also do not know if it's that I'm saying or different or I don't know what. So if anything like that's missing and then I'll go implement it or it's there and everything's there and then I'll just have a better understanding of what I've already done. So I just set it up and I'm like it's working. I don't know what I did. I got used to work. But like there might be, oh this is like Keith's run out some words for like elements of GA 4 and I was like, oh I didn't know it called that. Okay. So stuff like that.
00:16:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I don't think I heard the answer to, well, I don't.
00:16:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Do I want to do it more? Yeah, sort of part like that quote book. I should have, I was going to take a picture of the quote so I have it. So I'm going to murder it again. But the quote this week was like, you should only be working on high value tasks. Yeah. One of the high value things, so every day I get up and I read that. I'm like, yep, I gotta stay on this Mercer tracking. So, I mean, I would like to do more of it part of the part of the problem right now. No is this puppy. I get saddled with this puppy all the time. I'm like, guys, you're killing me with this puppy. Like, yeah, she's very cute, but she's, she's a huge distraction. Like, what are you doing? What are you doing? So I just have to break away and get something out of or whatever. My child brought home a baby duck. Oh boy.
00:17:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And she got she tied up for me and she did for a few days and then I went into her room. I was looking for something and I heard this little squeaking. There was a duck. A little fluffy yellow adorable duck that either raccoons or dogs will eat.
00:17:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So what's she thinking?
00:17:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. No, I'm like, you don't get to keep it here. But in the meantime, she's waiting until she goes to her dad's for the weekend and she can keep it there. But but anyway, I was going to ask. Speaking child. Why are you bragging about that right now? Um, I had a question. Oh, okay. So, um, I don't think anybody's ever talked to you about. Staying focused on high level activities before.
00:18:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
you sure?
00:18:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know I've talked to myself about it. New content.
00:18:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Dan. Yeah.
00:18:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, like, is that a leveraged activity here? Like, I don't know. There it is.
00:18:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, that's my argument for me doing it. Like, I mean, I already tried this, right? already made my classic lunder. had Eric go through the GTM thing. He went through it. To what end? But did you learn that thing? You get like, no? So, it was like, I can't, I mean, this is the whole thing, right? When I look in the Mercer, and watch Mercer does, I can then go 2 plus 2 equals 4, right? I can then look at whatever business it is and go, oh, I know how I can get that there, because this is how this one works, and that's how that one works. So, I'm watching this stuff yesterday, and I'm like, oh, I would love to know all this about the Wolf Hurry Sales page. I would love to know this. What is happening? Because that's a leverageable point. Hey, have these numbers. We start to forecast and say, and his forecasting is crazy, too. We forecast, like, impressions to the page, opt-in, right, month. We'll have the forecast, and then it's out for 2 years in this spreadsheet that scrolls sideways forever, and at the end of every month. They fill in every metric, they go, how do we do this in turn? Oh, well, look, our impressions were off. Bump-a-bump. Meanwhile, they can go to the report, the eye on the journey report, or whatever they're forecasting, and drop a hat and go, well, how are we doing today, right? So I could do the today thing all day long and know that we're on track, off track with another 71. But I don't look at impressions. I just look at the outcome. So I'm like, oh, it would be interesting to see, like, our impressions changing over time. Like, I can go look at that, but not in an easy, digestible, snapshot-y, dashboard-y way. So I'm like, yeah, all right, that would be good. And then it's super repeatable, then it just would become, especially for me, because all these businesses were the same in a way. It looks like, oh, yeah. If I just build this once, learn it, then can I then just task it and say, I need you to go build an eye on the journey thing for this. And they know, oh, it's all these events, we've got to set up these events. That's the part that I don't know now, but it's JavaScript GTN, like 90% short, which I have personally never used. But it is a thing. Oh, no, we have used it. We've used it for the video time that we did. That's it. Which we could put in a dashboard. You what? Which we could put in the dashboard that we don't. It could go on a dashboard. It doesn't. So for me to really see what's going on with that, I feel like do these weird reports and an active campaign and like, it's not exactly what you want to see, but it's a wave. for me to use that data to find out the best way.
00:22:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's I'm just kind of contemplating the path to this because. So, and I'm trying to think about because you had wicked reports for a while. Because I asked questions about this stuff many times and the question will be like, I don't know, like if I ask a particular metric about a website or the sales page or whatever, where's this, what's this number and I don't know. We've had conversations about dashboards and what I'm trying to figure out is what I. And this is not necessarily relevant for you because we're here now. But like, and I hate when I have so many questions going through my head at the same time and so many thoughts because it can't come out and then they have to be linear, but they're not linear anyway. But the knowledge that. It's hard to impart from my mind the visualization experience that I have of seeing this type of data and having built archaic systems and spreadsheets to track this stuff for myself for different things in the past and then helping somebody, not you per se, but let's say it's a maybe, well, and it wouldn't matter because you'd be doing this for them anyway with basis. But that every person running any kind of business online needs to have a dashboard with basic metrics. to me, what Mercer is teaching is so far beyond what everybody's doing, but it's also basic. Like, these are basic KPI. How long are people there? How many people come? Where did they come from? from like, this is what white heat maps have been around for so long, but almost nobody uses them. Where are they getting paused on the page? And then, but looking at all of the pages that matter, so landing pages, all of the sections of the page that matter, how like, they're still not really a good provider of that for smaller businesses. I'm trying to think Neil Patel has stuff, but he's not affordable to everybody. Mercer is not, is so complicated that most people aren't going to go through this or understand it even if they do, but they'll be fried before they even get to most of it. If there was such a need for a, don't even know what you would call this, but like, the website optimizer type person, like a person who is just about the data, who either directs or does all the work, I say direct because they don't necessarily need to be the one that installs the tracking codes and installs the heat map codes and any of the code on the pages, but they need to be the one that says I need this code, they need to be the one that can validate that it's working because the reports are coming, they should be the one that would be kind of masters of dashboards and knowing what types of dashboards we need, that there are different types to look at so you're not looking on a ton of data like we've been doing with Letify, like there's the intake dashboard and then the matters dashboard. Anyway, thinking about the, which is anyway, just how there should be a role whole for you. it starts though, it starts like this, it starts with knowing what you don't know from first 10 experience by learning through it and going through it so that you know how number one's even just create the like rudimentary version of what is needed but then so you're informed and know how to hire somebody for this role because you have enough knowledge to be able to engage in a conversation where you can evacuate it and know what they have access to but anyway that was a really long way to get at there's there's a way that we need to leverage this moving forward and apply it to anything that you're working on any project that you're working on and then also for me in the back of my head like pretty much anybody I'm working with needs to be doing something to this degree and I have not done a good job of Being able to relay First of all, what's even possible because this is not new the stuff that Master's talking about is not new He's been talking about the same stuff for at least 13 years.
00:27:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We have this At breakfast one day But it's Right the great part about his stuff like my stuff is He did it for himself So he's like, this is exactly what we do and this is and we learned our way into this. So I'm like, okay You're right. mean, this is like a total bolt-on to basis and You know, I would the reason people Don't or can't offer this as a service really is like good luck Good luck going into some random website and and being able to just easily At all this code and at all that like no Not gonna happen Yeah, and I actually think that's too hard.
00:27:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It hasn't been streamed by yet is because I doubt you would remember me bringing it up in the beginning, but one of the things that we talked about in the beginning when we started talking about data is how unreliable it is, which we did, I know you would remember that part of the conversation, but in that one of the ways we could validate it would be that all the different data sources disagreed with each other. Like visual or website optimizer versus improvedly, different stats, even if we've got both the code on there versus Google analytics versus wicked reports, whatever, nothing ever reported the same thing. So you know that there's discrepancies and then who's right? Is any of them right? And then if they're right, what's getting in the way.
00:28:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's a bigger problem now than ever. That's the that's the thing that this advent of GA4 and the advent of these pixel blockers or whatever is that attribution has become more difficult than ever right so but my argument is that if you are in a world my world where I can drop a first party pixel I am fully integrated with I have the full integration with segment tricks 99% of people can't do either of those so I'm like okay I have all these things I'm the dude that Mercer described as I have been a collector like I'm collecting all the data and I'm collecting the data that has meaning but I've been as you know as I've been complaining about forever like I can't connect the dots like I can't see the things that I want to see and now I'm like oh this is but this is Show me some things that I didn't know before like, okay, I can get some data into Metarick and I can get some data. So I think between like GA4, Metarick and Segmentrix, which might not even be needed, but it's there. I'm like, I'm going to be able to get an attribution picture that no one else can get. And then Mercer, I'm positive, is going to nerd out on that. He'll be like, what are you doing? And then, again, that becomes something that like, oh yeah, no, you can only get this with basis, right? That's it. And it just, it's like things are getting more complicated. And so, and if the data becomes less reliable, then you can't make data-driven decisions. And as we know, if you're not making data-driven decisions, you're really just guessing. And guessing only works some of the time, most of the time does work.
00:30:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:31:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And like the good job is in the click funnels and the go high levels of the world like they're not gonna solve it Yeah, but and then this is not meant for It's not meant to be like a mass product, right? I told it's funny that the development like to the general public Yeah, well, yeah, I mean it's it's not Truly scalable like the more I think about it as I'm going through as far as I'm oh, the price needs to be even higher It should be like it should be prohibited to get on it And like no if you want to get on this you have to understand What you're getting on and it's like you want us almost?
00:31:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
shy away the people That can't that can barely afford it because they're just playing and not get it or whatever Yep, well and because it's a it's a Longer runway to And that means that there's constantly a burden of having to prove the value, which is why they're complaining, right? Because if they knew that they were putting in a dollar and getting out to, nobody would say no. Right. when, and this is, so there's two components to it. Number one, people that are doing, you know, multiple seven through the gears versus not less than that, there's, there's corollary data points, which is not just their revenue, but also their traffic. And in order for to collect enough data to be relevant and, and to be able to analyze it and get something useful from it, there has to be a significant amount of traffic. Or you have to wait a long time, but either way, so, so when they've got more volumes, they're doing more cells. They probably have a lot more traffic, which means we get to the data faster, which means they can see the correlation faster. And then all of that data leads to a split test, right? So here's our baseline. What's the point of doing that if you're measuring it, if you're not going to improve it. So then, you know, and if you're going to improve it, you don't just do something and think, I know for sure it's going to work, it's a split test. And then you run the test, but obviously there for it to be conclusive, you've got again, volume. So that's another reason why only offering it to people who have a certain level of success, traffic, sales, whatever, would be good, especially if you're just like, I don't know, proving out the concept, getting case studies, Glenn never had enough traffic. Jody out, he didn't even have What's that?
00:34:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
think he did. Well, he didn't hit a personal website. Yeah, totally. Well, I've got like, they're like a, they've got the right stuff and they're on it. They'll be a good case study. Joe, like with Joe, it'll just be like, what are the metrics that matter for a podcaster? once you know what they are, right, like you leads and listens, whatever it is, then you build the dashboard around that. Once you know, I mean, you're going to have like this funk of JavaScript that you're going to par you's over and over again, you're going to get chat GPT to be your little, you know, I have Eric building these assistants where it's like, hey, this is a vanilla JavaScript assistant. And then this one's a Gutenberg JavaScript assistant, and then this one's going to be a GTN JavaScript assistant. And you just keep running the same types of code into the thing. You're like, all right, I really wish you those could get smarter, but they really can, but whatever. I mean, yeah, it's like, You can, if it works, right, of course, you know me, I'm like, yeah, we'll see. I mean, it all makes sense, but like, I need to see it, I need to see it, and I need for it to have meaning to me. And I obviously know the power of data, right? So it's like, oh, okay, that's the other thing with other people, like, they don't really get it. Like, I was just helping someone out. And they're like, yeah, we're paying. They said, like, oh, God, we turn off the ads. We're paying $250 a lead. I'm like, how do you even know that? That's what Facebook said. Yeah, but is that true? Oh, I don't know. When I looked at like their CRM. And I didn't tell them this, but I like, I did some quick math and I'm like, I'm at 90. So I'm like, but I'm not sure. Like, I have to really like, you know, do a little scrub or whatever. D do bit. I'm like, yeah, whatever number Getting from Facebook is wrong and they killed their ads and then 48 hours later like we got to turn our ads back on Which never was Yeah, and I'm like, but you're gonna Do you even know which ones converted and they don't mean I know they don't cuz I looked and I was like you guys aren't Bragging anything. Oh PS. know, you've had this was great. I mean you've had five hundred inbound calls And it looks like everyone I looked at no one answered And they're like really I go What's going on? Like where are those going that no one answers 500 calls in 60 days? Like that's a lot of calls per day. Sorry, right? So they're like, oh And that's the word that sometimes that's a good answer and sometimes that's a bad answer in this case.
00:36:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
a bad answer You shouldn't know I Was thinking you know if you get to the point to You Well, whether you have this analytics type dashboard thing or not, either way, if you get to spelling bases, I think the best thing would be a VSL because it really is a visual concept. think about all the exercises that we've done and the reason dashboards are so powerful. Like, we can talk about the numbers, but unless you're a savant really processing those without a chart, know, kind of seeing visually a relationship between this number and this number, it's hard to wrap your head around it the first time you see it, the second time you see it, the third time you see it. So if you're just trying to explain to somebody like having a sales conversation, they'll see, you know, just a portion of it, whereas if You say, like, before we even talk about it, you've got to go watch this video. You can't get on, you're not allowed, you don't get access to this, I know you've heard great things, it doesn't matter, you can give me all the money in the world, you cannot come here unless you watch this video and the video, like, we had the leaky bucket kind of visual that you've made to explain that to people and that was an aha moment for them. Now, if we could show something and I would have, you know, Joe used to make videos like this, there are definitely people who can make these videos that we could outsource it to, basically show them two or three different scenarios where, you know, this is your business, this is your traffic, and these are your steps on the dashboard and this is what business A has, what business B has, what business T has. And this is what they did, and then you watch them, watch the numbers change. And then you can tell the story where a business A had no idea, like these numbers are changing, but business A doesn't have a dashboard, doesn't track it, has no idea what's happening. so makes a decision by guessing, and it's the wrong decision because they didn't know why the numbers were, why they, you know, what they were, whereas let's say business B, same exact person has all the data, or maybe business B has half the data, right, makes a decision, same thing, doesn't go right because they're wrong about where the data, because they only have half the data, it's not accurate. And business C is like, oh, I can see everything, here's the problem, let's go fix it. And we've done X amount of split test because we've been tracking this. And so we know that we'll have
00:40:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
you know better impact changing the headline or the image or the call to action or whatever but basically creating a video showing it could be like one video or multiple videos could be case studies but another could be like i'm talking about going after 10 million 20 million 30 40 50 million dollar businesses and charging a premium price premium um yeah i think that yeah i'm starting to think like so funny because a perfect example of that right there is Dave Asbury right so Jenny is doing all the Dave Asbury stuff now running his stuff and their setup is so clued it's not even funny what is that word oh messed up flute means messed up yeah so yeah so it's it's all Stop it. It just doesn't make sense and it's because it it's like it's the classic like you went It was it's just all inherited And so they just keep adding on right to Christmas tree and on to the Charlie Brown tree they inherited when it's like oh boy So the day she's like we're moving everything to Shopify. They sell like single products like that is not what Shopify is for Shopify is not made for that and then it's like They're they're not they don't have all the right data like even though Jimmy's very day-to-driven They don't have all the right data. I'm like dude. You should be on WooCommerce like WooCommerce and funnel kid because there's no limit That's my argument. That's the argument that I made to Frank the WordPress bill, but he's like give me the back story Tell me what you're trying to build and I told me he's like oh, Yeah, he's like you sound like you know what you're doing like you sound like you really he's like you So I'm like, you know, a lot about business. He's like, I know a lot about teaching stuff. He's like, I suck at business. Maybe you could help me better at business. like, yeah, maybe. But it's like, I think that the path is like, you go through Joe, right? So it becomes a tool for Joe to make Joe's coaching business easier. And then it's like, who's another Joe? Maria. Maria wants to go build all these customer automatic customer things.
00:42:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could build an automatic customer starter site. Automatic clients, Alan.
00:42:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, automatic client. I could build an automatic client starter site that's just in the can. You launch it and reskin it for your next client. So then she's she'll get all the she wants and then some, right? then it's like, oh, who else is that? could go to like Greg Merley's and be like, hey, you should just be sending your clients to me because we can build because it's your designs are great, supposedly. don't know if they are, but he does good work. This platform is great. Yeah, exactly. I don't know if they really perform that well, but you can find out really quick by putting on a platform that gives you that data. So then it's like you having these other people sell it for you in the beginning. And I think to your point, it will eventually bubble up, right? So you could go like into Allen's group or go to Allen and be like, Hey, I'm doing this. But it's like, it's like, it's like, it's not open to the public really, right? It's like, we're, I don't want to deal with people. Like, I want to give a good service and good product to good people, right? Cool people, cool things, cool people. I'm not, I'm not trying to run around and get 10,000 clients because I just don't want to deal with that. But if I can get like, 10,000 clients, like, yeah, exactly. And then some people are going to, have are going to be a lot, they're going to need the funnels and the bop-a-bop, they're going to need the whole thing. And then it's like, yeah, then maybe you could append coaching or, and at that point, if you're not even coaching, you're just, it is, because you're like, you should be collecting this data, right? But you need to get, you need to expand what you're doing in analytics, because right, what you get is just the basic. But you want dashboards like this. Oh, okay. Well, yeah, that's, it's, it's a one time fee of $4,000. And we set the whole thing up for you. And then it's tracking all that stuff. And here's how you read it. And then that's it.
00:44:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But, I'm set up of like 10,000, like it's just, whatever, yeah, whatever it is. mean, don't even know how to price it, because I don't even know what it is yet. And like, I would not be looking in the, I am world. I'd be looking at doctors and lawyers, like, where are they congregating?
00:45:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But it's not that I am world is on saying no, no, I know, but the other day I was thinking like, I mean, it could be it could be like these coaches in the world are not the lame ones, like the ones that have real businesses, like not the one that I left, I mean, I don't have a room business. I left a hilarious comment on someone's ad today. Some woman's like, I just can't stand these people. She's like, if you want to get my $50 million a year business . If you were making $50 million a year, you would not be running Facebook ads about your coaching business. Ma'am, give me a break.
00:45:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you look like?
00:45:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You look like a bottle blonde that is using 20 year old photos on your website, like a miss. You're not the same person. I can't remember her name. It's, I've never seen her before. And I saw like two of her ads today and then I just left a comment on her. was like, I can't help myself. But, but it was like the click funnels awards, the lame, the stupid, um, sign with the slogan, I'm like, really? I'm like, this is like a textbook. I am scammer. Like, where's the Lambo? What are you doing? Yeah, never, never be gone.
00:46:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
email version of it is it repulses me personally because, because I see behind it, because I know what game they played.
00:46:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Um, anyway, I'm just so never them. It would be never that, right? like, it's not for you. So, and that would be very easy to figure out. You just go look at their website like, yeah, no, this isn't for you or you're not for being one way or the other. Um, but it's like those, those automatic customer funnels, like they can go either way, they can either be scammy or not. Um, yeah, it's like you get to. you get to decide. That's the whole thing. mean, they can't just buy it. It's not a do-it-yourself thing. It's never going to be. But I was thinking like two days ago, was like, man, really, what are you replacing? Like, you're replacing Upwork, you're replacing way more than just WordPress and Kajabi. It's really not on par with those. It's on a whole other level.
00:47:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Therefore, it should be priced on another level. But it's more than that. It's not about what are you replacing it because if you go with that logic, then they're going to try to do that math. And that is not really what the math is. It's like you've been walking around legally blind and somebody finally gave you glasses that are your prescription. And now you can see everything clearly and sharply. didn't have the glasses before. So you're not replacing something.
00:48:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
getting something life changing that literally changes the way you see the world it's going to stop you from tripping on everything and you know like it's just the correlation is different it's more i mean i was thinking more like it's the benefit argument right what are the benefits the benefits are what you're saying you're going get this better knowledge into your metric you're going to get a better faster sigh you're going to have to you'll never have you don't have deal with outside devs ever or deal like that's gone right so you're getting time back you're getting you're getting all this up oh what are all the benefits now you could throw away the comparative idea like oh it's it benefits like this over kajabi rather than replace kajabi you'd say hey you don't have to deal with outside developers and outside designers like all that goes away you're going to save time and energy there whatever bye
00:49:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
stop believing money because they're making stupid decisions because they're uninformed.
00:49:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Then you can start to make start to know your business on like a whole other level when then that I think that's key, right? It was like when I was on the forum with Jamie and Heather the other day and like Jamie's like, okay, gonna make these videos. No, she's talking about Instagram getting Instagram leads. I'm like, well, like Instagram leads have never really been proven to work, right? So if you go do a source report, which, you know, we can sort of do one of those. The data is somewhat there. And I, again, I would argue my data is better than everyone else's because I'm getting them forced when they become a lead. Now, could they have gone to YouTube before that or whatever? Yeah, maybe whatever. But when they entered, I keep calling this like first contact and what last contact people call first touch. Like, yeah, maybe their touch came through YouTube, but we can't, you can't trace touch. I can trace contact, right? can trace that hey, they entered our world One of contacts the right word still, but it's like they became lead and they came from this source It's far but I'm concerned. That's the source Right and then engagement instead of touch or contact Yeah, it's gonna be something else. It's like you can't use it's got to be a new word It's like yeah, like I can't use a word that's already used right so engagement's already used touch is used Contact is going to use Something I haven't read it through we'll read it through chat you can table immediately, but it's really good at that So it will be able to help you come up the word if you define what it looks like so it's not touch Like what does that look like to you and and what makes it not one thing but something else Well, I mean you could say well and I want to use the same word for the beginning and the end Right, so it's like your last so when they purchase it's that's the last version of the first version is a lead The last version is they purchased right so it's like Not interaction like it's some other word, but anyway, so when I was talking to her about it It was like I'm saying I'm gonna get an Instagram do more. I go well. Okay, you get more leads on Instagram. So what? So what you got more leads on Instagram, right? I'm like more leads is not gonna solve the problem. The problem is that you don't right She's making the cloud. go this is the classic blender get more leads like that's not the answer And she's like let me see if I get this street So you're saying if we go get more leads, we're not gonna make more money I'm like, that's exactly what I'm saying and she couldn't put it together And I go but if you I go that's not entirely true if you go get more YouTube leads They will convert therefore you will make more money. the question really is how do you get more YouTube leads? That's the question to me to answer because that's where your money comes from and she doesn't have an answer for that. So I'm like, if you don't have an answer for it, then I mean, it's not all that you can do. But if I can right now go spend $10,000 on Google Ads, I'll get a lot of leads and I won't get $10,000 back.
00:52:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Have you ever done YouTube ads?
00:52:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, we ran some YouTube ads, but like, it's you can't track them, right? You can't track like the Tom Breeze ones, so you run the ad goes to the channel so you don't get attribution back to YouTube or the ad. So you could look to see like, hey, when I was running these ads, and this is like, it's hard, it's very hard to do because you can't necessarily say, hey, when the period of time I was running these ads did leads go up. So you could do that and say yes or no, but then you have to dig deeper and go. Did all the videos have the same average views as the other period or did she put up a banner video or did this video from whatever so you'd have to look at these Intermatrix of like Did the referring video like which? Did the leads coming in go up? Where did they come from which video to go up and then does that make sense right? Does it make sense that this the video that usually drives leads went up? Therefore my running ads sort of juiced that That would probably be the way to do it I'm thinking I actually do that. I just never did it.
00:53:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I'm not going to because they don't have any money run as Well, I'm pretty sure that was like one of the first goals Or things I said when we were talking about you doing level activity, part of when we do your effective hourly rate, years ago, was saying that whether you hired and trained or just hired somebody who could do ads well for you, that especially if it was somebody where you could say, okay, this is what we should be trying, like, so you're the strategist, at least or consult on it, but somebody that is good at doing it, but you know, did add like you and did the containers the way that you did, but how it keeps changing, the hiring pool keeps changing, so the thing about what I just said is like, I'm the only one that can do that, like not me personally, but like me Dan Ryan basis because nobody tracks the leads from their videos with the that I built.
00:55:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
of that, right? It's because I have that data. Now, in the Mercer world, that data would be in a dashboard and you'd be able to look at that at the drop of the hat. Yeah. I hadn't considered.
00:55:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which would change everything that you do in terms of add the lead generation, which is a huge part of your world and your puzzles at the very least, even if it's not necessarily part of basis, which could be. But anyway, yeah.
00:55:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, because that's like another avatar is like the Jamie, right? It's like going after the YouTubers and just saying, Hey, I've got a I've got this thing that's good for YouTubers. You should be on this because you get all this stuff. But I think part of the like Jamie is that they're like, I follow this to Rick Biano. who's got this massive YouTube channel and he's like this super music nerd he does great interviews but that MFR is running like a sale every other week and I'm like dude please stop stop running sales like you're losing money who's ever guiding you is guiding you incorrectly every week it's some stupid sale like you're devaluing yourself this is not a good thing but they're probably at the end of the week going oh look we got $10,000 in sales like oh geez no don't do that but he's like a he's a perfect YouTube and I can tell you right now he has no idea which videos drive business because nobody's ever nobody's ever done it on braces like I had never seen somebody do this yeah but I think will be interesting now a year from now because of AI like
00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Google's integrated AI into search results, Google on YouTube, YouTube definitely has the AI, like what, whether or not it's available at a free level, which I don't imagine they'd want to, but I feel like, we don't know, that better analytics for this stuff is not too far away unless they want you to stay operating blind so that you keep guessing, so that you basically are gambling.
00:57:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And that was the upshot of that video that I mentioned a couple weeks ago where the guy turned off all the black box stuff and got better results. he was like, the less I told them, the better I did. But that's because, you know, they just want us to take your money.
00:57:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but we're
00:58:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
right and that's why this stuff like I mean the thing that I don't know that someone brought up to they were like oh well you know stafari strips strips the utms I think that is true but I'm like I don't have that problem if just switch them all to PGT they are utms and then now I can't I can't tell google analytics that they're utms but I can get that data in google analytics as like an alternative utm right as these events better and then prime build dashboards based on those as if they were utms they are they act just like them they just literally are not them I was like that's something else other people can't do you
00:59:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
last week on. The summer pace is always a little slower and slower. The strolls to work. I got my dog and he made me my mom. can't wait for the kids to finish the Is it what are they doing building it? Well, it's a came, you know, all the parts. So they didn't have to like engineer it and blueprint and design it. But it's it's been, you know, top to bottom, start to finish building it. Oh, and almost done. What was I looking at? on. Sorry. I lost my notes when I lost my. mouse. I mean, that's all the stuff that we're working on really. OK, and hopefully you don't have to run anywhere. Just ask some quick questions about just whatever else has been happening. Rapid fire, rapid fire, rapid fire. Well, touching any of the projects, just just anything that stands out as a problem, an epiphany, an aha, since we talked last.
01:01:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
very near higher Frank. Frank is definitely next level. So I think that's all gonna get done well and good. Norio finished. Perfect wedding timeline. And he released it to Abishik for software testing. So they're going back and forth right now. So Norio's like go find the thing. So he's like, all right, now we're in stage two. Bugs washing. So we'll get him to try and find some stuff. Then we'll let some people on it, let them start using it. And then it'll be like, then we can release it for like public consumption. Which my plan there now is, this is so weird like, so Jamie's tagline is lovely humans. So like over a year ago, that domain was for sale and I bought it. never told anyone.
01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
one.
01:02:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then I started to figure the other day, like, I need them to give me this domain, like the whole point of me telling them to come up with a brand name so that I could be brand.
01:02:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You need them to give you what domain?
01:02:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
To take that. need to do ownership domain, and we'll keep using that name. But the domain needs to be my name now. And I was like, she's never going to do that. And then I thought, Oh, wait, I'm going to trade her domains. I'll give you lovely, lovely humans and you're going to give me perfect wedding time line. And she 1000% will do that. And I paid like 900 bucks for the domain or something. So I like, I got to do that. So then we can roll that out. And then I think, I'm just going to tell Heather and Jamie, but just tell the dude, Hey, just working with another vendor. That's it. Like, you don't owe the guy an explanation. Just say, yeah, we're working with another vendor that we can. That's it.
01:03:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What guy?
01:03:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And the timeline genius, the guy that's getting- Oh. They're doing like a 50-50 rev split, but like he actually makes more money because we have to pay someone to do all the customer service. So he actually makes more money. So, but I think I'm going to, I mean, kind of want to tell them like we have to change the split, maybe, or I haven't really figured it out yet. So anyway, so that's going to, so now Norio's available. And then I hit him up yesterday, I go, okay, great, can you start working on this fan flowy stuff? And he's like, absolutely. So I had a couple of tasks there for Saad, he wasn't responding, and then all of a sudden today, he's like, done done. So we'll see if those are done that we can finish this Spotify integration, but then I'm going to unleash Norio on like the two or three apps. We want there, which he should probably be like, dude, this is simple. I go, well, the other is even simpler. One might not be. I'm going to hold that one for the last. going to get some clarification on how to build this. We need to build some sort of API into GoDaddy that will allow people to make sub-domains on fan flow. I know it's possible. just not sure. It's actually the right move. But anyway, Noreo can start working on that stuff.
01:04:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to hit up Mark and then take that lead. Because you can make sub-domains on high level also, can't you? It doesn't have to be done at the registrar.
01:04:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It does with all this new email . You got to append all those extra records. But yeah, so yes and no. You're going to want it to be custom. They'll get to pick the sub-domains. but we're going to be like it should be your band name teama gang dot fan flowy dot com so that won't probably be last because i think it's the most complicated but i'm going to actually ask i level like hey how would i do this uh and then i'm going to go back to shot and mark and then they've got so many bands on this now so we need to like take a step back and like clean up some stuff but like the core stuff is built it works it people are getting results right now i'm like we just need to clean up some stuff and then go this you know version one was waiting for the Spotify thing stamp it as version one but like okay and then i'm like you guys need to charge everyone that's on there right now a subscription like you should not be selling this as and and um and included it should be hey start your subscription and then we're going to charge you to run your ads above the clock because you're your bypass the whole primary model of it being a recurring subscription based business, right? You're you're including the software for free. That's a mistake. Like, now, if you want to, like, give these guys like, uh, founders price that we never take away, fine. I'm totally okay with that. Let's do that. But they need to, they need to be running subscriptions and then because then they can tell people, oh, I have a subscription, but you might not be able to get the price that I get.
01:06:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then I was like, okay, value of the software and service.
01:06:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. So then I was like, all right, we're going to do that and they'll do it. And then it was like, then I started thinking similar line to your, like, I told Darryl about it and Darryl was like, what? are you building?
01:06:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I told him, I was like, I have to, I'm sorry. Every time I think this, did you ever watch Darryl? Larry Larry Larry Larry Larry Larry my brother Dale Every time you see Daryl every time. I'm all the brother.
01:07:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No Okay, I told Daryl and I was like, oh man, I just got to figure out the math of this So once we have like whatever the price is I was like we should do an affiliate thing with Darryl's Daryl's in the studio with a band every week Every week. I'm like if we made him an affiliate and we paid him a percentage of the script subscription for a fixed period of time Right. Hey, you get x percent for the first Six months or if they stick three months you get x percent and it's equal to Why So for every band you get on you're going to make 200 bucks or whatever it is he'll refer it out all day long. And I'm like, how many other darels are there? Or maybe you do pay them in perpetuity, like high level. If I came in as long as I stay on, then he's even more motivated to do it.
01:08:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yes. But it could be like, there's a higher front end costs or whatever reward. No, because you don't want to tend to bring people. So tear it up. So once you bring us, you know, 20 people, and it has to be how many people are currently subscribers. So let's say if you get up to 50 subscribers, so up to 50 subscribers, it's like 4%. 50 subscribers active and above, it's 5%, whatever. numbers mean nothing. point is that you unlock the levels by how many existing subscribers you get. Yeah. So that they are incentivized to bring people that stay because then he doesn't have to keep replacing them just like, you know, any other business, you're better off having to go chase down new customers. And, and then he unlocks higher levels. And like, why would you not want to pay somebody? there's a marketing budget anyway.
01:09:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's just basically the marketing budget, they go get you customers. And he'll get bulls-eye customers, right? And then it's like, okay, and then if you only have a handful of them and those guys know people, right? So it's like, yeah, if we just open this up to a handful of people, like, it's not come one, come all sign up for our affiliate program. No, no, it's like, taste maker affiliate program. And if you get like 12 or 20 people that are dialed in, they'll do it. Especially, I mean, because it's going to be, it is going to progress. So that stuff's all going, and then it's just like with another 71, it's like steady eddy. We're still climbing towards the 490, which I think I figured it out the other day, sometime in September.
01:10:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:10:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Here's September. Yeah. Yeah. We should hit that, and then I got some other, like the dent repair guys, those are the dudes I was talking about earlier that have all the leads, like they want, they want to build, it is interesting. like, do you think you could build a PDR as the name of the industry, or do you think you could build a PDR version of high level that could, we could sell the PDR industry?
01:10:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
go, yeah. Yeah. What's PDR?
01:10:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
A painless dent repair. Oh. So like their, their business is a show and, but they're making money hand over fist, and I'm like, but you're probably losing money hand over That's sort of that that's sort of that the hidden the hidden thing, right? It's like By not knowing all your numbers. You're you're losing money You just can't you just can't see it. Yeah, yep, sort of like mark like mark on Monday. Like he's coming It's coming around to what the real problem is mark. You pay people too much hate to break it to you He's known so last year No, I know but now it's becoming like Painful. Yeah, yep, and painful is when the change comes and and the reason he did it Was to be a nice guy Right, he didn't he didn't do it because oh it wasn't for retention. It wasn't for whatever It was for Whatever it was to feel a good number room I think that's part of it, but I think part of it was retention because he was if you remember Really concerned about losing people, especially samantha I But I just don't know if his concerns real, and I think that I think that's also happened. No, I don't think it is, but I think it was to him for a long time. Yeah, yeah. definitely.
01:12:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He the theft. Yeah, that like, and how long it takes to replace people and the comfort like people weren't as happy.
01:12:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh my God, the revelation was wait, these people don't need to be lawyers. I was floored when he said that. I'm like, whoa, And he's like, yeah, no, they don't need to be lawyers. So I'm like, oh, well, that totally changes things, right? Because you cannot, he cannot tell me, and especially if you talk to Salko, Salko's like, dude, this isn't that hard. He's like, these guys, they're not lawyers. Like Sam and Tyler, and they're not lawyers. They are not. He's like, they are people with law licenses. There's a huge difference. mean, he would argue that. Mark is not a lawyer. He's like mark has never set foot in the courtroom ever and he never will so it's like ever Yeah, most of them won't most of them never will because I know that's right doesn't want to that's why he likes this I mean, that's the track that they're on right so in a way they're completely overpaid and now even more so I'm like Dude, they're really overpaid and you know, I just keep saying it But it's like I know the time's not right, but I know the time is also rapidly approaching If you start to dial in these processes, which is happening with intake, which is where it should start You start dialing in these processes You're he's gonna discover. Oh, yeah, I don't need lawyers Like you could because it's all It's there's no if you're never going into the courtroom Right if you're never going in and trying to woo a jury and get a higher verdict And you're just dealing with the black and white. It's either there or it's not Right so you can't make an argument to get this huge settlement when the policy doesn't go that high. So there are these built limitations, but the processes don't exist, right? like in Salko's point, that's why the whole AI conversation I had with Salko when I was like, oh, no, no, you could teach it to look for words. And he was like, oh, wait, what, really? Yeah, yeah, totally.
01:14:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But, okay, so, and this is why I take a holistic approach to business is because the CEO is always a bottle that one way or another. all are, because we're But one of Mark's issues. I know I am. Same. Is that he needed Bonparone, but now he's making friends.
01:14:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes, exactly. All kinds of things happening.
01:14:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yes, yes. So his need for that is changing. And in, I, I didn't put the two together before, but you know, yeah, anyway, that's what happens when people and it's like, you're looking at the map on the page and I mean, he knew it.
01:15:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I wasn't even really sure, but it came out of his mouth. He's like, oh, it's way too high. I'm like, yeah, probably is.
01:15:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, what?
01:15:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
When he was talking about payroll, he's like, my overhead is way too high. And then we, and then he drilled it further and said the overhead is payroll.
01:15:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, a bunch of people wrote it. Okay.
01:15:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's the other interesting thing. I don't think he had thought about it. It didn't seem like it to me, but I'm like, dude, if you're just growing and you're not making more money, what are you doing? And he thought it was to sell the firm and I'm like, but is that, is that what the multiple is based on? And he's like, no, not really, right? It's like, oh, it's the cases. That's the thing. I think he's starting to see that. I mean, he's done it. He's on pace to do almost a hundred this month into the math yesterday. I think it's in 94 Not counting whatever closed yesterday. I sorted I could be slightly off. So he's on pace to do a hundred in July where there's a holiday in the summer Right three things three things that are against that happen with his best lead source Monday getting the bed Totally just doing horrible and it's like get here you are and You know what? not hearing I'm overwhelmed. I can't we need more pods like it's not a trip That is not true. That's the next thing bringing it that up Monday Yeah Bring that up Monday And if anyone's gonna complain about being overwhelmed, it would be in California in the summer Cuz they're like I'm missing out going it's not like something like dude every time I talk to Tyler, he's at the airport, going somewhere, like I believe in me.
01:17:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so the last thing that I wanted to say, well, two parts, I don't know, my brain is like shutting down now, but that even our thoughts are iterative, you know, like, because we are changing, having new thoughts constantly, like it gets frustrating because like something will be obvious to you, something will be obvious to me, but that's, we're thinking based on our lenses, based on our experience, but also based on our makeup, being, for example, you're happily married with two kids, and like, home life matters, and our ability to make certain types of decisions is affected and affected and infected by the rest of our circumstances and so changing those things, changing his morning routine, him changing friendships, changing all these different things, makes him able to make decisions he couldn't have made before because Mark as a person, as an emotional creature, which we all are, as EOR, needed to make alterations, but those changes don't happen like that. They don't happen overnight. They don't happen because we had a conversation last week and you immediately apply it and change it and then you get the impact and effect and but it's it's all gradual. It's all a gradient spectrum type of changes, results of changes. Now we have new insight. Now we have new lenses. Now we see things differently. we know more things. things. Now we've altered our environment and the gist. That's why it's so complicated. That's why pacing matters so much. I know, you know, like I'm not preaching to you, but it's just every week, I think about, you know, what we could have done and what we already knew, but you can't take the person out of the equation. But, and that's also why, if you're going to launch basis, your first few people, 100% because that interaction is probably going to be more weighty than maybe down the road when you streamline everything. Those should be the most cherry-picked kind of clients, partners, whatever that you bring on, because that will affect the trajectory, I guess, of how basis evolves. because no matter how much we want to think of it as a system, a process, a product, whatever, you're at the center of it and whoever you're interacting with regularly is at the center of it and that energy makes a huge impact on the decisions that get made so the path that gets plotted out and so on. Yeah, anyway, just pondering, I guess. And my brain is going, I need food and probably nap. Well, I get a massage in two hours. My Russian massage Elena, she's so good. She's like scary also because she's Russian, but also she's like a second mama and loving and it's awesome. It's a 90 minute massage and I'm gonna go nap after that.
01:20:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, or during.
01:20:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, she talks too much.
01:20:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)

00:01:25 - Chona Sweet

00:02:09 - Chona Sweet
No, so what happened was he bought a dragon device, but it's not compatible with my apple and he bought apparently he bought me a laptop, but I don't he's all over the place. The one that has I don't have it, so I'm still using my Mac, so which and if I told you this I have arthritis and I can feel it now.
00:02:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I'm a witch.
00:02:43 - Chona Sweet
You did not tell me that, but I have osteoarthritis and yeah, I have I have psoriatic arthritis, so mine is a different kind of different, but it's you know it's it's more of like a you know skin, I have two in one psoriasis and I That's fun. Yeah, that's lots of fun.
00:03:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, did Mark decide if he's coming or not?
00:03:06 - Chona Sweet
I don't think so. He's slammed. He's like so short when he responded. he wanna, I'll let you leave.
00:03:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You tell me what you want. So let's go back over the homework quick.
00:03:20 - Chona Sweet
So map out, ideal, work read. Okay. So I can also copy his comments into my notes, which I was actually, yeah, when you're done. No, I was thinking about it and I don't know why it's having difficulty answering that question. I don't know why. I feel like because your question is now and the future. Yeah, I don't know why it, I'm having difficulty answering that. question. That's, that's something to look into.
00:04:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tell me just work through it.
00:04:13 - Chona Sweet
Talk, talk to me about it. So I think right now, I mean, maybe because of the, um, uncertainty of all of these, like, I honestly do not know how I, I assume that I will have to work a lot. That's what's in my head. That's why it's hard for me to even schedule something for, to work on my physical health and maybe, you know, schedule a workout.
00:04:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel that's actually the reason for the exercise. So we reverse engineer it is what we do. Now there are going to be seasons where you're definitely Going to be putting in a lot more time. You're in one of those seasons right now starting as always the hardest part right, but there is There's not really any such thing as work-life balance right where everything's always everything is good all the time That doesn't work but it's more like Changing harmony like if you ever seeing and you're seeing in music the notes are changing constantly and Sometimes they're in harmony with each other. Sometimes there's dissonance and all of it's beautiful and and it's orchestrated on purpose, so What what we want to do is figure out So this is a conversation about principles and priorities and values right and from that so Principles and priorities inform What we're going to do and why we're going to do it and well okay so principles inform priority right what's important to us our values inform what's important to us what's important to us is priority right and priority informs activity what are we going to do it should it doesn't always most times people are on autopilot or they're doing they're reactive and they're doing what they're told to do or what they think they ought to do rather than what is actually most important to them so by having this conversation early on we get to the point sooner rather than later where you can do the things that you need to do because whatever you do if you're burning yourself out it's not maintainable right hey Mark sorry I just caught the last part about trying to burn yourself out on purpose now yeah tell me something I don't know mr. sweet let's go faster let's go Oh, master. Oh, my gosh. Tona, do you know how many times if I could have, like, reached through the... Yeah, who many times?
00:07:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm really basis for her as well with me, so I have to I'm telling me shocked.
00:07:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, we can shift gears, Tona. We can go back to that because I'd rather use Mark's brain for two things. So what you brought up is just...
00:07:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm suddenly you drugged up at the moment, so just as an FYI.
00:07:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

00:07:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. My little girl went to school for the first time in a week. They've got COVID. It's been going around yesterday. I almost want to cry just thinking about it, but I got her up, and I'm like, are you going to go to school? She goes like... I need to like yeah, you do and so I go out and she gets dressed and she's to the door and she's got her backpack on She's being a good girl, I look at her and she got tears down her eyes, and I'm like going back to bed You were not going to school Okay, I feel better now. Okay, wait, no actually she thinks that's distracting me I was trying to pay attention to what you wanted. Okay, so When you're talking about she has a first shot at first one shot at first impression. Yes What is good ice? Oh, look how cute.
00:08:30 - Chona Sweet
Shona is China you so I'm telling he's You're cute.
00:08:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

You're beautiful Cool sandwich place in New York City Tell it's based in Tuscany, I guess like all on Tonshio sandwiches So they make the bread fresh every five minutes and so it's really thin You guys get all this good food.
00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I live in redneckville, okay, and they're And when I get to go visit my sweetheart, I'm like this Let's have like just feed me. I'm I'm happy. Okay. So, okay, so the automation and follow up. Sorry, is a conversation we were having. But the fact that you brought up first impressions, make me wonder if there's an issue that's happening. Okay, so let's talk about that.
00:09:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So, because we can never time things perfectly, because you know, like, there was a patient that came to see Chona that was involved in a car collision. And it's not like a big enough case that I would get super excited about. mean, I would probably take it all things considered. So this was a really good way to for her to introduce herself to some other law firms, right, one of which ways to introduce yourself to a law firm. Hey, I have a potential case for you. And depending on how she had the relationship start, depends on how you would approach that, right? Yeah. And so the initial reaction was she had a law firm try to send them a case at one point and pull the case from Chris and Frank. And so I was like, okay, we'll meet that. the good one, but they weren't very responsive. So, I connected Chona to Mike Hobbes, who's a firm that I personally work with a lot. I like the guys a lot. very, very straightforward, but they're a very high volume firm. So their model is they get a lot of referrals from other attorneys and they also do a lot of their own marketing. This is not as we confuse with the Hobbes up north that Dan's worked with before, just FYI in case that comes up at all. They do about 300 cases a month. So, they do a pretty significant amount in just California. Okay. So, they're a high volume firms, but they're good guys, right? wouldn't connect to Chona if you didn't think we're good people. So, I don't know how the conversation went, I just said, hey, I'm introducing you, I called Mike, I told them about Chona about the practice that's going on, and one of the things that Mike said is, look, we're getting pushed back really, really heavily about doctors in our cases. So the doctors making a huge value difference on the personal injury side, which is something that I've you've heard me preach about, you know, 10,000 times. That's why the doctors are so important. So I go and spend time with them. That's why we keep trying to find new doctors because the personal injury course gets to be known as, you know, people who just do the same things again and again and become very well known and the insurance companies devalue them very heavily.
00:11:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you watching the football game?
00:11:27 - Chona Sweet
That's, I don't know how you can see the background on the school.
00:11:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What, that was sorry.
00:11:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's muted.
00:11:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's squirrel squirrel. Okay.
00:11:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Anyway, I thought it's wrong. And so that's one of things that I love with what Chona works with with Dr. E because he does so much insurance work. He barely does any personal injury in comparison. And so he's a very like clean doctor. And so even if gets to pose or whatever else, he can honestly say the vast majority of my work is insurance. This is what I built all this is when I do this is why it works. And it's great. And so for a firm like Mike Hobbuses, they're really excited because, hey, this is a new clean doctor that's like a secret weapon to someone. So now we've got three factors coming together. And I do this to kind of lay the groundwork, right? yeah, she was reaching out to them with, Hey, I've got this new client for you. So awesome. This doctor's already sending me clients. I told Mike, you know, I don't really want you on a sending me clients and not really want to send them clients because I think it could theoretically be a conflict, even though it's not. But just to not be conflicting.
00:12:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Avoid the appearance.
00:12:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Avoid the appearance of it. Reality and appearance are obviously two different things. But you know, these are people I trust and they're like, okay, that makes sense of why he's marketing me something really great if he doesn't have any interest, right? And it makes sense of why I'm doing it because I can't do it really for myself. Right. So here's Chona's introduction this afternoon to Mike Hobbuses, who could drive them, you know, 15 to a. hundred patients a month.
00:13:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, huge.
00:13:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
They're not ready for 50 to 100 patients a month, unfortunately, of new PI with how they're set up. But I can always pick and choose the timing of these things, right?
00:13:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, you can not do it preemptively, like too soon. You can do that.
00:13:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
an option for past that option.
00:13:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I just wanted to make sure that we are fully accountable across the board.
00:13:28 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
The other part of it, too, is I know Dr. E's, I mean, he's patient, but there's some lack of patients as well. Like, you know, been 45 days now and he probably would want to see some movement on the personal injury side.
00:13:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're faster, Mark.
00:13:42 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What does that sound like? Yeah, I know. Constantly faster. But also, this gives Chona a reason to say, hey, we need these things in place rather than just home.
00:13:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, sorry. dias are starting to hurt. Okay, focus, focus, focus.
00:14:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Her, I also saw this as a way for Chona to leverage this fact of, hey, I've got this new attorney's office who produces a lot of cases that's going to start sending us stuff that we need to get our together for lack of a better term, because Dr. E said the right things during our lunch of, hey, we'll make sure we have the proper email and proper things, but I kind of know how these guys go and like they'll say the right thing, but they get so distracted by shiny objects and, you know, else that's going on, and just quite frankly, his work period, that it's not top priority until it needs to be a higher priority. And so this is a way to push it to be a higher priority. Okay. That being said, in the short-term interim, so you were trying to push Dr.
00:14:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
E into making your work that you're doing a higher priority. I just want to make sure I'm on understanding this clearly.
00:14:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay, cool. And sorry, Chona's value and everything else. So that way, Dr. E gets a little more excited about building up the structure he needs to build out. Realize it's actually right there. Correct. And it's happening and not just theoretical and not . Yeah, got you. Um, so that's the reason for it. And I know that if something does go wrong on the first one or two, like these are guys I know well enough I can give them give Chona another chance in a couple months, but I obviously would prefer not to do that. So so when you talk about first impressions, you're more about like the whole operation, not like I'm talking about, unfortunately, you know, Chona's been told, okay, we've got this like info ad, you know, pain management or whatever it's called. We've got cast. We've got everything else like you telling Chona like, just do it yourself until you have a system that works because when you rely on other people, it's not their priority. It's a higher chance of it going wrong. And so it's building a temporary system until she can build a better system and a better thing around it.
00:15:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm with you, except you need to understand where she's at. She is in the oldest profession. That's not the oldest profession. Okay.
00:16:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:16:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:16:05 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That is definitely not the oldest profession. Why not? she's in that.
00:16:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a whole other thing we're going to talk about. Okay. One of the oldest professions ever. That is predominantly male. And this is, this is the reality though. There is an energy and a stigma and a literal psychological term. Ask Jonah that shows up and I'm trying to explain this in the way that you could understand because I know you and I know you're like whatever just do it. That kind of thing. But it's not that it's actually it's really not that easy. Of course it needs to be how I do things. Okay, but so there's there's two things that you have to deal with. Number one is the the actual issue of the structure and the mentality that she has to massage and work around. But the first step is China has to feel confident enough to do that. And that is being built up right now. That is new. So you remember how I talked about saying sweet things, Mark, and being encouraging. This is going to be one of those things where you actually have the most power to do that and just encourage her, again, a particular way. Because I can tell you as a woman who's come up, you know, six years in corporate and then in this business, there even when you're a very, very strong woman and born that way, there's, there's a lot that you have to fight mentally because you're kind of groomed to feel energy and then pull back when, when you resistance and kind of be like, okay, well, work around it, whatever. So the best way, and I'm telling both of you, the strategy to go around this is similar to the tactic that you just pulled, which is let me show you what's really on the table. So, and Chona, one of my favorite things that I learned is that it's better to make forgiveness than ask permission and just kind of do things. But, Mark, the stress and the energy that, so let's say she goes and she does everything perfectly. It's still going to stress the crap out of her. And she's going to take that energy and anxiety and it's going to need to have an outlet. You understand this? You've gone through so many things since we've been working together.
00:18:31 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know. She's in control of it and it's not up to someone else to drop the ball. For sure.
00:18:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Chona, who's being quiet right now and can participate in this conversation, you can do all of these things. But you guys will all get there faster. Just understanding the real, like, so you're not answering your phone first thing in the morning and checking the email and being reactive to everything that happened. She's barking at the dare. They play tag. Literally, they will just chase you. each other and the deer will stay there. And if the dogs go away, it'll stay there until it comes back and then they just wait down. Anyway, have a daddy. What was I saying? Sorry, it's only last during the talk. Dogs, but I really need to be out of time.
00:19:21 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, if I were in children's shoes, I would use this opportunity to leverage it. To talk to talk to me, to say, hey, I've got this potentially coming in. Let's try to make a system for right now of some of these new patients coming through because the one in our trip, it's like, yeah, I'm going to make these changes. going to set up this email that's proper. going to talk to Cheryl. I don't know if I'm to or did that not happen or you don't know.
00:19:49 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, so I'm not sure you want me to answer your question for you. want to talk about what we talk about. We have us or, you know, I don't know where you guys will just start right now.
00:19:59 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
we need to know what structure has been
00:20:00 - Chona Sweet
I haven't seen him the whole day. I just saw my patients because he texted me like 20 minutes before 9. He says, oh, you're taking over Long Beach patients today. And so I just get ready and it's 30 minutes away. So that's what happened this morning. But to answer your question, I haven't talked to him. He's gonna call me supposedly tonight. He's in the OR right now doing cases. So that's that. So I don't, I don't know if we have an email. Sorry.
00:20:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry.
00:20:40 - Chona Sweet
Go ahead. You're still talking. Right now, I spoke with one patient that's coming from Mark. Actually, I talked to her last month. So she's kind of all over the place. So finally, she agreed to come tomorrow. So that particular patient is coming from me because. through Mark. So they created a group chat for me, the office manager cast, which is part of, the office manager Cheryl cast, which is part of the lean and then me. So they open a new chat for me and then another person for me to put in there all the patients that's coming from me. Just a, not a formal medical records. It's more like, Hey, I have this new patient. Can you put it on the list tomorrow for me? That's, that's the, that's the only progress so far that I've seen that some sort of kind of segregation, like for me to say, this is for Chona from Chona, you think the chat for her. So that's actually a good thing because I, that's a start because I, I checked them today and I said, Hey, I want this patient to make a release. then the managers, like, we created a chat for you. I said, I'm not included. So and then he's like, okay, let me include you. So that's actually a win already. That's number one and then number two about Mike have us about this new patient that I I'm referring to them right, so I talked to Mike have us and I we talked briefly about the patient about my background Where we're at where offices at and he asked something that I really don't understand he asked something about who manages your lean or your the paper you guys have someone else just doing that so what I understood is he's third-party Person like choice and what I said is no, it's just us managing That's my answer and then he's like, okay, so that's that was a question.
00:22:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Let me explain to you exactly what he was asking They know exactly what he's asking. He's asking about billing Yeah, it's a lot of pain doctors and a lot of busier practices have either third parties or a biller handle it. And it's generally a huge source of frustration because those billers are paid on what percentage of the total bill they get. So they're incentivized to try to get as much from the lowers as possible. And on our side, lower side, it can get really frustrating because it just sometimes doesn't make sense. we'll make a very fair offer. And they try to squeeze out an extra hundred bucks or 200 bucks that just pisses off the attorney and takes acceptance. So yeah, so what you about was you being the main point of contact for billing for scheduling for everything else kind of in the short term. So you have control and how this feels good about it. And God forbid you ever leave Dr. E or go somewhere else. It's tied to you and not to someone else.
00:23:48 - Chona Sweet
So here's where my appreciation of all of this right now with with because I view and I told Mark about this and Mark gets, you know, easily appreciated with me. because I asked a lot of questions and I'm new. I have to reiterate that I'm really new at this field. And I don't know the dem, you know, all the abrogations, like anything like that. And sometimes I think Mark gets frustrated because, you know, Mark wants the things done, but he doesn't want to discuss the steps towards it or even diminution, like little things. I, like when I was asked that question, talking about first impression, I don't know if he got impressed with me or not because I, and he asked me questions about where do you do your MRI. It's a good thing I remember where I've been there for one and a half weeks, one and a half months. I remember this imaging place. I said, the wave imaging, I said, and then he said, that's actually a good place. it's a good thing that I even remember that. But then again, between Mark and Dr. E, I don't feel like I'm getting enough information, like. actually not support me, but it doesn't feel that way, if that, if I'm being honest.
00:25:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a lot to say, let's break all of these things down. First of all, just taking into account that there's a lot for you to wrap your head around. And Mark, so have I ever used the driving analogy and explain that to you what it's like, either one of you? Okay, so do you remember what it was like to learn how to drive? Yes. Learn how to drive.
00:25:29 - Chona Sweet
Actually, I was telling Mark I learned how to drive here in America.
00:25:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so here's, here's the point of that is that when you learn how to drive, first of all, my girls always think that it's so easy. They're like driving it so easy. I can't wait until I can do it. And then they get behind the wheel and they freak out because it's terrifying because what you have to process mentally, you have to know the law. But the law seems like it just goes out of your brain because now you're faced with, I'm at a forward intersection and I don't know if I go left or right. to drive stick. So I'm also trying to process the clutch and the gas and the break all at the same time while my mom's over here freaking out and I'm feeling her energy. And then I'm like, do I go? Do they go? And there's all of these thoughts and it is overwhelming and frustrating. And every single second in the car is stressful. But then a year later, you know, you've just been doing it. And one day you look around and you're like, this isn't that bad. It's not that stressful. And five years from now, you can eat and drink and have phone calls.
00:26:32 - Chona Sweet
You shouldn't do that. I'm just kidding. Nobody does that.
00:26:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, don't worry. I don't put on makeup or do any of that stuff, but I will eat and have a conversation. Oh my gosh. Anyway, there's the neighbor dogs. So the thing is, in the beginning, and for quite a while, you're mechanically processing everything. But there are gaps in knowledge. So when you're first learning how to drive, if you've never come into They have roundabouts now. They didn't that used to have roundabouts. some of the roundabouts have multiple lanes. And some of them don't. Every day, China is running into something brand new. Every day. And we don't know what we don't know. So sometimes she doesn't even know what questions to ask. But then if she has enough perception to say, I need to ask this question, but there's nobody to answer the question. Or nobody who can answer it from the perspective that she needs it, right? And that's different brains. It's a combination of different brains, and different personalities, as well as different values, which hold on to that word of values, because we need to come back to that with Dr. E. But you have to keep all of that in mind. Chona, this is why I'm telling you, like this is where you just have to buckle down and know it's going to suck for a while for all of these reasons. And you are going to deal with people who don't understand what it feels like for you to do what you do. And that is part of the path and part of the journey is not doing it because of how other people show up because of but because of what you want to come out of it. So if people aren't giving you what you want, then you have to decide, am I going to keep pushing until I get what I want? Am I going to drive this? Or are you going to let Mark drive it? And then you are just passenger and you're just kind of the leaf blowing in the wind. So I would recommend that you take a little bit more charge of it. If doing these things that way but for you to feel confident in it, you're going to have to drive and but taking into account that right now you don't know how to drive. You don't have the tools and you don't have the practice so it's important to keep that perspective and it's going to continue to be frustrating. Now there are things that we can do to speed up that process and smooth it out and one of the things is having a conversation with Dr. E between the two of you, I'd be Happy to join the conversation and help facilitate it, but it's really important to know what are his drivers, what are his motivators, what is his top priority. Because if his top priority is I'm on autopilot, I get through the day, I want more money, but I don't want to really put any effort into it. I don't want to do the structure. I don't want to make any changes. That's not really compatible. So then you got to hold them down and mark this to somewhere where you could be really useful be like, you say one thing, you do another. So like, these are the numbers that are available to you. Now, don't use my language. Use yours. This is me saying this is around the conversation, right? You have to figure it out. Now, did you just sell him into something he wasn't really interested in because you could?
00:29:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, no, no, no. Okay. Dr. E is a good doctor. He's a better business person. Okay. And he's been doing some personal injury before all of this. Personally, he's not brand new to him.
00:30:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if he's a good business person, why is he not understanding how to support this process better?
00:30:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He is drinking out of like four firehouses at the same time.
00:30:13 - Chona Sweet
Like Mark worse than me.
00:30:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's not necessarily a good business person.
00:30:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That's a busy business person. Very busy business person. Like we're talking about how he took over for Optum. Now he has 6,000 plus regular patients he needs to see and not enough staff to build on top of it. He's in the OOR right now. He is a practicing doctor while trying to also manage this business. And again, what he does on the insurance side or is the personal injury side are two almost contradictory practices. And so what I mean by that is he gets paid up at flat fee per month to take care of all these patients. He gets a little bit extra for, you know, each procedure he does. But he is almost incentivized to make it harder or more difficult for these patients. patients to come in, because he gets paid the same amount per month, whether he sees one patient or a hundred patients.
00:31:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That sounds very contradictive to what you're trying to do.
00:31:10 - Chona Sweet
So I don't want to cut Mark because we already established a key busy. I feel like he wanted someone to drive this, but here's my problem. I feel like I'm walking an eggshells, not with him, but with his office manager. So, you know, Cheryl. Cheryl wants to be involved with all of this. I don't know what kind of pay structure he did with her. I feel like he did also something else with PI with her, and he or he wants her to always be involved on the back end because he wants to take control on this PI cases.
00:31:49 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
But even another layer to it, he won't let her negotiate on the billing for PI.
00:31:54 - Chona Sweet
He wants to be in control of the money side of it. No, he does. She negotiates the PI too, but she gets frustrated. because the lawyers always, you know, negotiate down, so she doesn't like that, but she, she, I've talked to her multiple times because I wanted to be on her good side too. I wanted to understand how the practice works. She wanted help, but at the same time, I don't know if she's ready to let the rain go, you know. So, because when I asked her, if I have a new client that's coming from me, how does it work? And she once, and she, wants her to be emailed first. And that's what Mark and I are trying to avoid, is steer away from that, create a universal email where I am CC, where it will go to me, go to Cheryl, go to Cass, and go to E. But that's the email that Mark is talking about. Beyond that, it's the politics of me trying, I feel like I'm walking on eggshells with Cheryl, today. that I have a new patients for tomorrow, I already make a schedule and then they ask do you want me to call the patient schedule? No, I already did all that. Because again, I wanted to drive this, I wanted to make sure that I'm in charge on making sure there's appointments. again, that's where my frustration is at, other than no structure. But we are overwhelmed with the new patients coming in because of this optimization.
00:33:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And new patients, not PI patients, they're regular.
00:33:28 - Chona Sweet
PI, this is the regular patient of the clinic.
00:33:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so there's a lot of moving parts in there and personalities and roles. And that's what I was talking about too, having a conversation like understanding what drives and motivates Cheryl. Chona, I don't know that you were there for the conversation, but we were talking about how can she take stuff off of Cheryl's plate or how can she make it better because
00:34:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm sure, so like Mary, this is kind of, I don't know possible.
00:34:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cheryl's married. Right. So sometimes it's working around, sometimes it's working with, but first we have to identify what is the situation. I'm probably going to move in a minute.
00:34:15 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
She's driving me nuts. Go ahead. More than that. It's making sure Cheryl's still somewhat in the loop, whether we're working around her or not. If she feels like we're actively trying to cut her out. That's when there's going to be the biggest problem.
00:34:26 - Chona Sweet
Which I can talk to her again tomorrow. Every time I go see her, Cheryl talks a lot. I feel like I like her as a person. She's a dog person. I really like her. But her mouth and her mind are working really fast.
00:34:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry.
00:34:44 - Chona Sweet
Hold on.
00:34:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So do you know what she wants? Like what motivates her? What is she happy with anything in work? How long has she been told?
00:34:58 - Chona Sweet
old is she? Um, I would. Let's say she's, I don't know how old she is, but she's probably like early 50s, yeah, mid 50s. She has been with Dr. East since the beginning, which is, you're due to the 2017 honey, he's probably about the same or longer.
00:35:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
She's been around for a while, she's like theoretically quite like 10 times kind of situation.
00:35:24 - Chona Sweet
They have a very, they have a relationship like Mark and Mary. However, she is more vocal than Mary in terms of, and this is what I don't agree, but then again, Dr. E allowed that to happen, but she would call him out and call him, like when I say call him out, like they argue verbally, very, you know, other stuff and hear it, which again, that's their relationship. But, um, but her as a person, we talk and we actually gone into, you know, a deeper level. She, you know, it's just, she's just the kind of person. But I think she doesn't like more work for her, which she verbalized. And with this new up to 300,000 patients coming in, she's overwhelmed. So she's hiring new staff right now. Um, that's what's happening. So in terms of the PI, this is not her priority, if, to be honest.
00:36:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, that's important.
00:36:37 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, that's, that's where I come in. She really thinks that I will help her off low without taking it away from her. That's what it sounds like to me.
00:36:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is a very clear distinction. Um, so then you have a conversation about that. With her? Well, I think. I'm not really sure. This is this is one of those things that takes some finesse and maneuvering. So, and it works better with time, which is, he's not patient. Mark's not patient, so that doesn't work out very well. But Mark, so here's the reality. If you don't take time to finesse and massage it, either Chona is going to fail because that it's just not going to be worth it to her emotionally to do this, or Cheryl's going to leave, or like something is going to blow up.
00:37:38 - Chona Sweet
Right. Before we left, we added the lunch with Dr. E, and he said, he's going to talk to her about the clinic, but at the same time about the PI. Because he, Dr. E, he's supposed to hope. hire someone to be just in charge with P.I. calling the patients, creating that connection with the other lawyers or whatnot. So that is the plan, but the immediate plan is to create an email and phone number supposedly. Just for P.I. because I told him I'm going to attend in November, I'm going to attend this thing with Dr. Choy. That's a networking event. I need to be able to provide a card with the email and phone number that you want that someone will have to answer that phone. That's right now our phone system, our current patients are mad because they're calling no ones answering. They're leaving voicemails and the staff go to the voicemails whenever they can.
00:38:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I think one thing that might be really helpful and without creating a lot of friction is start with an org chart and roles and responsibilities. the P.I. structure isn't 100% knew he's done a little bit of P.I. right?
00:39:04 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Unfortunately, yes.
00:39:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Chona coming in and the arrangement that you have is really a new kind of beast and a new structure. So it might be good visually to outline an actual like org chart of what the structure looks like, maybe like a company within a company or whatever, however it looks like, but then roles and responsibilities so that there is a very clear visual without even talking to Cheryl about it. Coming to the table with this piece of paper that shows Chona is not a direct report to her that Chona is the head of her own little kind of department. Look, because otherwise you're going to have this battle.
00:39:51 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So You are in my spirit.
00:39:54 - Chona Sweet
I think you kind of know because we're contractors. knows that the way in her mind, because again, I've talked to for a long time, I feel, every time go talk to her is like three hours. But anyway, on her mind, she's in charge of the business side, part of it, the logistics of patient appointments and insurance, and also in charge with Medicare paperwork on the providers. The medical side is Dr. E, so that's how she's structured in her mind. So if there's a problem with patient care medications, it's Dr. E. But if there's a problem with, I guess, Medicare or whatever insurance signature we need to do, it's her.
00:40:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So within that, there's, what I'm talking about is delineating a difference between P.I. and any other patients. And thinking of that as almost like the silo inside of the business. So that, and within that realm, you manage the patients and the finances and the operations that now, Mark, you were making a face when I was talking about the org chart and all of that.
00:41:22 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So a little bit, because like, she's like a merit. And so in my experience dealing with have a thing.
00:41:30 - Chona Sweet
Anyway, what? No, I said that that's that. Unfortunately, like Dr. E, that's what Mark allowed to happen. Same with Dr. E, that's what he allowed for Cheryl to talk to him that way.
00:41:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't agree with it. Because because it's not delegation, what's the word when you you why can't I think of this word? It's driving me nuts, freaking hairy menopause didn't ever used to have this happen and now it's just like tip of the tongue. Anyway, um, an abdication, abdication. And Mark, you're good for that, by the way, abdication, an abdication, abdication, they've got it, whatever. Anyway, you're doing amazingly better now too, but this I think is a similar situation where it's like, out of sight, out of mind. I don't want to handle it. I'm going to, if I can yell at you and tell you to handle a certain amount of things and it comes within the realm of what I'm okay with, then that's all I'm going to do. And that's the situation. But the problem is you're trying to build an optimized structure within a chaotic structure that the two aren't very compatible. So either I mean, like, now if you were just putting a person into this, it's a whole not a business. You can burn through people. This is your wife. So Oh massaging it well and making sure that it's not like ruining her in the process is little bit different. But you have the ability to drive it and here's how you do it. The angle is always the numbers when you show people the numbers when you show them. This is what's on the table that we're not getting to, but also here's the cost of this structure not working properly. Here's the cost of you letting somebody be in charge who doesn't even understand the value of this and why it works this way and why it needs to work this way. This is what happens when you don't follow up with people and we're trying to build an engine that generates money. But it has to operate in a particular way because PI is different than everything else that you've been doing all of this type of stuff. But so if you can sit down with the data, whatever data you can have, it can be some forecasting and some projections and just say, look, this is this. This is what it would look like if we're operating a capacity, this is what the finances look like, this is how many patients we have, and then let me break down operations for you. Let me tell you how I imagine it would look like, right? One person has to be in charge of this. We have an automated follow-up system, it does this and this and this for scheduling. We've optimized charting, we've done all of these things, and then you really don't have anything to do with a doctor, except for you house it, and you hire Chona, and from time to time we have meetings in conversation, so we're all on the same page and making sure everything's flowing. Like that's how simple it is, however, it's only that simple if Chona is empowered to be able to build the structure that has to happen. So are you in or are you out? Like really, that's the conversation. Now, however you finesse that and negotiate that, that's up to you, but I'm telling you, the clearer you get, and the more data and vision. jewels you bring to the table. And I'll give you a reminder, every time we needed to get you on board to buy into something, it happened as a direct result of we got numbers.
00:45:11 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And then you're like, okay, and seeing it what are the issue that she was facing is if Cheryl thinks you're trying to go either directly around her or just not involving her in some way, shape or form. I don't know if she's going to go to the point of trying to sabotage. We're trying to make things just significantly more difficult.
00:45:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So hold on. So this is an if, right?
00:45:39 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And we can do if all day long. We don't know. Okay, with a relative degree of certainty that if we try to go around her cut her out, she will actively get significantly more.
00:45:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I agree with you. I agree with you. And what Chona is dealing with is alpha females type of thing. Like if you're the head girl in there, another woman coming in, it's almost most always, it does not work out very well. So, but, but Chona is not that type of person, but it doesn't matter, because it's their perception. That's all that matters. So, but this, this is why Cheryl needs to, I would have the conversation with Dr. E first, and then with Cheryl so that she could recognize this is a silo. This is a thing within a thing. So it's not about cutting you out. I'm taking nothing away from what already exists from you. And what I'm bringing in, you wouldn't have if I wasn't here. So, you don't need to worry about that. But here's what I'm going to do for you anyway, while I'm here. I would love to help you with some of your systems and some of your things and help improve your life. you can do that, Chona without taking too much on yourself. And I think that you can bring some improvement, but, but while you do it because your stuff is not her stuff, it doesn't matter if she adopts it or not, right? And it could just be being a friend, being nice letting her vent, like whatever kinds of things. But she needs to be able to physically see and wrap her head around how this doesn't exist and be very clear that it didn't exist without you. It's here because of you. You're not taking it from her. You're bringing something in new that has nothing to do with her, but exists in the same building for all intents and purposes. And either she can wrap her head around that or not. And then you guys have to deal with this and make a decision. Is this compatible? Are you willing to work under those circumstances? Or do you need to draw a line in the sand? And if so, draw the line. But either way, be very clear about what you are willing to do and not willing to do and don't put it in somebody else's power with their attitudes and whatever. Either figure out a way that's compatible or find somebody else to do this with.
00:47:55 - Chona Sweet
I thought, well, I talked to her. You talked to her, Marcus. me and I and her talk and you know that that is the the common thing that we're trying to say is you know how can we help you make it a little easier for you but bringing it in so like for example like the chat system that I start today again it's like saying hey this is coming you know it's kind of like me in a way telling them this is coming now and and so I think she is on board um she's overwhelmed with the new new optimizations but and I think Dr. E recognized the burden on her and that's why Dr. E said he will hire someone else it's more a full time because right now there's a part-time person doing the PI which is cast um which is related to Cheryl again it's very close to it but um I think we are there so it's just more of a rating I think right? Because we already talked to her about this. It's just more of really happening now. The main problem is someone who answers the phone. We need someone who- There's a lot of issues.
00:49:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, there's a lot. And you know, both Chona and are trying to figure out how to approach this in the way that gives her the highest chance of success, right? Because it's a lot of different factors and a lot of different factions. And his practice is obviously very, very different than what my stuff is to some level. Same time, it's also very similar to what I have to go through. And Dr. E recognizes that what they do currently is not going work for PI. Cheryl also recognizes that what they do is not going to be good for her period. So the good news is they both recognize that there is an issue. Neither one has a solution for the issue, but at least they recognize the issue. And so another part of the reason to kind of with light of fire under this, I guess, for lack of a better term is when people see that it's actually a fire that needs to be put out, then they tend to pay a little more attention to it and put some more resources behind it. So is that the most ideal way of doing things? No. But you and I both know, like, especially when I'm like, , we're really behind this month. What's going on? We started taking into things.
00:50:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then we mark, which is last time you called your vendors?
00:50:23 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What? No, it's the same kind of idea, right? Yeah. It's Joan, are you paying attention? So, you know, it's not saying she's not paying attention, but like you're immediately going to get her attention one way another by saying something like that. Yeah. Here, Dr. E is focused on making more money. That's the only reason he's doing PIs, not because he wants to help more people. Sure, that's part of it. But he's doing this because it's another income stream. And Joan is doing this because it's going to make her more money. If it doesn't make her more money, she's not going to put up with this extra stress and headache because this is more work and this is more stress than just clocking and clocking out. There's no doubt about that. But Chona wants to make more and wants to grow and you have to go through pain in the to get there sometimes. This is gonna hurt at the beginning. I don't think there's any two ways about it. Chona's gonna have to do a couple of things that she's maybe isn't comfortable doing because it's not all spelled out while we get it better figured out.
00:51:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think she's doing amazing. Every week, this is the perspective that we have to have and you have to take Dr. E is like every week, there is measurable growth that's happening. So new levels of awareness, every single week that are significant, we're only six weeks in. first 90 days of anything is almost always mostly just information gathering and topography. That's it. It's just mapping. There's learning and understanding and then understanding the layout of the land then coming up with the strategy. So the pace of this is already pretty good. And I know that you're like bigger, faster, whatever. But the reality is, I've built companies from zero to seven figures, my point is that those are small to big really quickly within a year, many times over, but the thing, and I've come into ones that I've just hovered around for like nothing and then just exploded, it happens, the pace of it and the structure is always the same, if they're going to be successful and not implode, which by the way, I've done that and I've watched people grow way too fast with their arrogance and sell too fast and everybody lost their jobs and everybody lost everything because they grew too fast and that was the main goal. So understanding the human resources and the human aspect of it and knowing that the brain can only process so many thoughts in the first place, okay, just learning, then learning how to optimize while also dealing with other people and their personality. all of these dealing with the pecking orders, dealing with all of that, this is a process that takes time. If you're not going to break it. Yeah, anyway, so it's on a good track, but you are the thing that you, it's an unknown. You're building in somebody else's house is the biggest issue right now. You have to decide if that house is compatible with your vision because you're still a homeowner of your own, right? You're like, I'm building a house on your property, not in your house kind of thing. So that's a better reality. So I still need to have autonomy over my house and can we cohabitate? So that's the unknown. Worst case scenario is it doesn't work out with Dr. E. You guys have learned a ton of things and you go take it somewhere else. But you need to, there has to be a possibility that, and It comes very powerfully with this energy of a take it or leap it. It's the power of like a few money. Basically, it's like, look, we know it's going to work. We want to be compatible. We know that this is your property. This is everything that you're doing. We want to do this with you, but understand that we're bringing the strategy, the awareness, the skill, the expertise. We're taking care of your clients. We're managing the tech, the billing, the whatever. We are optimizing everything and you get to read the rewards. What can't happen is you pull out the rug from underneath. That's the cutest off of the knees. What can't happen is you create a bottleneck that closes off everything when we've discussed having open flow and making this happen. So your energy, even if you don't say the words that harshly needs to be like, okay, we're working together, but understand.
00:55:00 - Chona Sweet
I'm driving this whole thing and that was the point is that we're driving so You know you brought out a good point because I feel like well first I'm new and the expertise and I'm feeling you know, I I going over that hump of You know feeling self-doubt or whatnot that you know, I wanted to drive this Within Dr. E stuff, but I feel like I'm not confident because I don't even know the the terms that's being used You know that that's that and the second thing about the building is he has his own thing I think the majority of it the main point is he still he doesn't want to let go of the full control because he obviously the contingencies of what if I leave he needs to make sure that he can control that Yeah, we started and he's gonna benefit that I can
00:56:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
help you with that by the way. This is just a conversation that you have. So sometimes I work with new clients and I'm not 100% sure that I want to stay there. And I will let them know that ahead of time. But what I will also tell them is if I grow with you to a certain point and I decide, you know, I want to go, I'm going to replace myself. I will hire and train and insert somebody and you will still be better off than you were when I got here. So you can't replace me and you should know that I'm that invaluable that I never had anybody be able to replace me. But what I can do is build a structure and train somebody and train the rest of your team and also be available for consult afterwards. So but what you should not try to do is try to own me, try to control me, try to pigeonhole me because I can serve the best being free to work my magic and do what I do. So yes, you're, you're new at learning these things, but you aren't just you, you're, you and Mark together. Um, you have just because you don't know the specific terminology and the processes and the way they do things doesn't mean you're not incredibly intelligent, powerful, um, innovative, all of these other things, right? So I go into people's businesses. never know anything. Everything is brand new. Like I understand business theory really well. And if I ask enough questions and get enough answers, there's probably no where I can't bring a tiny bit of value, if not a lot of value, but I have to be able to have enough experience. I have to be able to listen. I have to be able to observe. I have to be able to watch for a long time to wrap my head around it to bring any value. So it's all potential. It's all there. But if nobody answers questions for me, if nobody lets me watch anything, I can't give anything. So there's no point in me being there and if that's okay, if I'm not wanted and I'm not needed, then I shouldn't be there in the first place But we're under the premise that you're wanted you're needed to facilitate this particular thing Therefore you need to be given all the things that you need to including the time and the space To wrap your head around what exists there rather than coming in with a grenade and going okay We're gonna just build this and blow everything up. No, we're going to figure out how to be symbiotic We're going to figure out not only just how to coexist with each other, but you feed me I feed you we're nurturing and nourishing each other in This thing that comes with strategy strategy has to come with knowledge and wisdom and experience which only comes after certain amount of time but somebody has to be able to Articulate that and have that conversation and make sure that there's an awareness that this is what's happening because most of time and people are like freaking neanderthal level conversations, money, faster, let's go. Okay.
00:59:08 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know what you're talking about.
00:59:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I wasn't honestly, Mark, I've got lots of experience with lots of people and you are not that brute force. I mean, I hear it, but then you're like, yeah, yeah, I get it. I'm talking about there really are people that just can't even comprehend the things that actually have to happen at all. You have at least beacons of awareness that fles for a moment.
00:59:35 - Chona Sweet
Yeah. I think, you know, even Dr. E, one did he say that he told that to me I think a week ago, I think he's also trying to think in his head if I'm worth this. And I think when he, when I was taking care of a meeting patient and I called whatever, I forgot exactly what happened. But he said, actually you do. feeling, helping with the lean cases now is, you know, is really worth it. He said that verbally. So it's like, okay, that's good in my life.
01:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to give you a strategy that you can use. And that is, you know, when you're wanting to ask for something and do something. So not only can I help take the lean cases off of you and ease your burden there, but I can also add blank. So you want to remind him what he's already acknowledged. And you want to remind him that the because because people forget, Jonah, they forget what's good. They forget what's right in front of them. They forget the value. People do that. They do it in their relationships. They do it in their habits. It's just it's human nature. So you want to remind him there's already proven value. I'm going to bring more. You didn't even know like this could happen and how good this would feel. Now, you know what this feels like, wait till we actually get going. So kind And I suspend your stress and your doubts and your disbelief and, you know, let's get at it.
01:01:07 - Chona Sweet
Speaking of the devil, he's actually calling me.

So, hey, here's Shiny Ball with how this coming through, because it's been 45 days, so like the newness of Chona is kind of wearing off like, yeah, because you I mean.
01:01:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't mean she's not. No, no, no, no. I do get you. That's why I said, oh, but that's actually the perfect timing to do the numbers and the forecasting that I'm talking about. And look at on paper, this is what we're talking about, and then saying, this is like, so then you reverse engineer it. So what's the capacity? Then reverse engineer that across the timeline and go, okay, well, here's where we're at now. You know, if we grow at 5%, 10%, whatever, and make it a reasonable, taking all the things into account, like how, what we could do that. So what does that pace look out? How far are we away from this number? And if you're going six months, nine months down the road, and that seems like forever, it's not, because how else are you going to get there? six months or nine months from now have all that revenue coming in, and this additional stream with all this new systems and understanding, and you just, that you could potentially go apply somewhere else, like a whole new level of awareness on top of the revenue stream. You can't wait six to nine months to, to let that be built out and, you know, deal with a little extra.
01:02:53 - Chona Sweet
Like, where does he think he's going to go get that revenue without any effort anywhere else? Right. I think the only number that, You know, Mark told him that he's kind of that his goal to reach is the 400 patients a month that cap that mark that's from that He can calculate how much it will be Do the calculations for him in a spreadsheet?
01:03:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can do it on our next week's call if you want to we can do it in the middle of week We can have a separate meeting to do it whatever, but and we can we could do a little whiteboard It's too late right now to be able to do that. gotta go check on my daughter But that we could do that together or you guys can do it, Mark You've got it. You've got enough experience to do that, but basically What is the pace potential so I know from Fuji's marketing and his timeline like 18 months from now for sure You guys could be doing that But you know with all the experience that you have and and the SEO cuz Fuji did his own SEO So you're also a jerk into difference that Chonazim is an advantage that Fuji doesn't
01:04:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And the reason with the people I work with of, hey, there's a conflict, but I want to make sure, you know, show those taken care of with working with good people makes total sense.
01:04:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, nine months from now, that's an entire possibility, but, dude, get out of the way, like, either you want it or you don't, you don't get to want to and control the things that you don't understand. Yes, you're the doctor, but there's more to the business aspect than having a medical degree and going and handling the patients and even owning the business. Like, this is his, this is not his realm. You're coming in and you're taking the mental load of it, organizing it, masterminding it, structuring it, and facilitating it.
01:04:46 - Chona Sweet
So, my question is this, before right now, short term, if I talk to him right now, and he said, did you guys do the emails? That's no. Okay. So, I'm going to have all new, I need my business card with my email then. then I will be the point of contact from this for this new patient as of right now. And then the second one would be phone numbers. Now, this is what I wanted to ask you, and also I'm going to ask myself, do I put my phone number there for right now? That's my question. It's like, can I really do that? What if I'm with the patient talking to a patient and all of sudden there's a lean call that I have to answer or...
01:05:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, I'm going to be to backtrack. So building the optimal system means doing things the wrong way once in a while. Sometimes you don't know until you try it, and then you might get a Google voice number that's not your actual number so that it's separate just for this business with that face for Mark.
01:05:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He told me to do this for two months straight.
01:05:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because you want to be able to segment things and not have your number be attached to all these things.
01:05:57 - Chona Sweet
just opens up a can of worms. Oh, that's the best.
01:06:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You could do Grasshopper, but Google voice is easier, it's cheaper, it's less hoops, it's a shorter learning curve, I mean, it depends on what you need to do, if you need to have a complicated phone tree, then Grasshopper would be better, because I'm not the pending pincer miserly, but I also do the level of intuition that's needed to be able to organize it. The bottom line is figure out what you need to happen, how you need the calls to be handled. If there are options like logic, if this then not, if they're calling at this particular time, if I want to be able to press this number, if I want people to be identified ahead of time. Like if you, and probably would be useful if you really think this through like, how could I process different types of people, can I give them option one if you need this option two if you need that, Grasshopper would be great for that, and then you can actually use the phone system to kind of help process people. Faster even just by putting them in the right category priority, whatever. So, you know, I you're triaging right I get to this person faster because they Raise their hand for this and that type of thing.
01:07:11 - Chona Sweet
So Then the grasshopper do like if there's a number that I choose and we'll put it on the That will be the one that we will send out Can it be one transferred? to a different number once we have the main person who is gonna be answering calls or what once we have the Ask them the questions because all numbers have different transfer rules depending on where you're transferring from and to the reason I was suggesting grasshoppers That's why I use my first start my firm.
01:07:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I've used it.
01:07:43 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's it's it's a great service Yeah Yeah Yeah, and To your point you can make phone trees like okay, it goes to let's just use castes things It goes to cast castes and pick up then it goes to chona chona doesn't pick up then it goes to x then it goes to y You can make the phone trees, so you've got the backups, or you have all of them at once who are picks up, picks up.
01:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So the first thing that I would do is the two of you to do this together is map out what would be the most strategic way to process any types of call, right? If you could have the phone system working for you and make your job as easy as possible, what would that look like? Then you go look and say, can I do this? And what's the priority? Changing the number isn't the priority. mean, if you have existing business, it's a thing. could have some issue. could potentially lose some business if you change your number. But if everything's going, well, why would you change your number? Number one, and number two, people can, we all have cell phones now. not like there used to be a roll index where you went and write things down.
01:08:53 - Chona Sweet
You just be like, hey, save my contact. Okay, believe me, I've updated.
01:08:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
know what I mean?
01:08:58 - Chona Sweet
I did. Before I forget. I forgot already.
01:09:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait.
01:09:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I was just going to say, we don't want to use the Dr.
01:09:07 - Chona Sweet
main number because right now it goes to who the hell knows. Okay. I remember now. Also, I wanted to make sure that there is a way where we can delineate, okay, this is coming from Chona because if they call that number and it goes to pass, they say it's for Dr. E's. You know, that's what that's why I really wanted my email to be the one, the point of contact that the email on the card like here.
01:09:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
have the. I love the way you're thinking and so the hierarchy of all of this is first you have to have a conversation about what is the actual goals and values that are driving because if somebody has an issue with a decision that needs to be made, the decision supports the goals and values. And they're getting in the way of it, then, okay, something is not aligning, right? Either this is the goal or it's not. If this is the goal, what the hell is your problem?
01:10:09 - Chona Sweet
Why can't we do this? now, there's two. One from him that's currently on, which I'm also taking care of right now. And he said he didn't say the amount, but he said he will also pay me higher on those because I'm taking care of them. And this is mine, the future one. And he said it's 50% of each consult and 20% of procedure. This procedure, I don't get because it's coming from him. So that's why I really wanted to deal with it, you know, but that Mark said whoever he's not working now, but it's going to be very hard. But I don't think Dr. E is going to, you know, he. He's a reasonable guy.
01:10:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He's going to be going to vote. Really? like your show says his, he's not really going to like push.
01:11:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it makes sense even just like I'm on GoDaddy.com like Dr.
01:11:06 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
E. Payne.com was available. Like would it even make more sense to just build out a separate site for his pain management stuff?
01:11:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They went to quarantine to build it up. Probably, but you want to think about it a little bit more through just to make sure that like you've thought about all the things that you need to think about. That's all.
01:11:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Because two separate email programs can be difficult for someone to handle.
01:11:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yeah, what is the whole picture? what does that open? And is it going to, for one small reason, create more problems than it solves? Probably not, but I'm just saying it's not as like, yeah, just QKN doesn't mean you should. Yes, there's simple logic in that, but the business is complex and it deserves the thought about every aspect and what are the adjacent issues, secondary, tertiary type of. of consequences, potentially, of creating that. Does it trigger any trust issues? Do they feel like you're trying to siphon anything off?
01:12:11 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
would be asking for is OK first without.
01:12:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, right. But the answer to my point is think about it, talk about the right diagonally, all of these different ways, explore that. But the one thing that you guys could do that would be the simplest thing, and just get a piece of paper and write it out. So where do all, where does the business come from? How would this business be handled? How would this business be handled? You could take a picture of it and send it to me, and I'll create something more professional, kind of flow chart. Mark, if you could, and I'm going to give you a homework assignment, and Tony, you can neck him forever. But what do the numbers look like if we get him 400 clients? Like, how did the finances work? How does he get paid? I guess Fuji does it, but he has a whole team of people that help him with different things. So what I need to see is the game plan written out. If you do that for me, I will help you come up with the pitch to basically be like, look, this is how I need you to get on board.
01:13:20 - Chona Sweet
I will be able to handle it as long as I don't help with the main thing.
01:13:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I just need you to write everything out. And if you can kind of do it almost like a flowchart, my map, so the segments build the containers and write out like this so that I can visualize it. But also then I can help you with handling the conversations with Dr. E and Cheryl. So anything that's related to Cheryl, if you can draw a little circle and kind of show me what Cheryl does and what you can do to help. I might ask it'll probably inspire questions so I'll ask you some other questions but we will get a physical representation of visual of what's happening and then where we're going and how it helps Cheryl and how it looks good for her how it helps Dr. E looks good for him and you guys because when people can see we can literally on the same page because a page actually exists does that make sense um it becomes very powerful there's always an epiphany and aha like holy crap that's not what I thought it was every time right Mark so um we didn't get to some of the other things that I have but that's okay that's the pace and the priority has to be what it is so just tracking your time and having that awareness that you did have right you can only learn so much every week you keep coming back with this this new something so Keep that up, you need to encourage yourself and know that you can't do all of the things, but if at the end of every day you can look back and inspect it and go, I learned this, I did this better, I made this grow, got traction here, I got momentum there, whatever. If you have a few of those to look at every single day, there's nothing wrong. You can't be superhuman and you should go to bed with some peace and be able to relax and go like, I progress today, I move things forward.
01:15:31 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, it's, you know, for right now it's just more of me getting faster and, you know, with my between being patients and charting, because some of my colleagues, they do it, the follow-up patients, they do it right there and there. I've been charting after, I've seen everyone. I do chicken because, you know, I do my notes little here and there and then I kind of perfect it after. It's really just making sure I don't charge the entire night.
01:16:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. I want you to think of the driving analogy.
01:16:11 - Chona Sweet
Yeah.
01:16:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
01:16:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
in a parking space for 30 minutes doing nothing to implement your phone is not going to get you to a spot you need to get to either.
01:16:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. No. Decompressing. That's called decompressing mark.
01:16:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I will slap you. You're just called procrastinating too.
01:16:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't her sandwich. Then I know. Yeah.
01:16:33 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Mental. She has food in the fridge.
01:16:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She has it. Mental. I don't even think you understand the mental load of a woman. Like it's a whole not a thing. It's not, it's not picking. Like our brains are different. Our brains are different. So I could be wrong, but I'm just saying it could be just a decompressing. Don't be nitpicky. Damn. She's doing good.
01:16:58 - Chona Sweet
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
01:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:17:02 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You know, you know, but most of you are in better.
01:17:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, maybe you can like, do you get more and better? Yeah. Yeah.
01:17:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Not a $406,000 bag nice and sweeter.
01:17:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, no. Money has nothing to with literally got paid to $406,000 bag and we're both like what the F is. Why?
01:17:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I know. I know.
01:17:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The bag of my house costs.
01:17:30 - Chona Sweet
Okay. That's a bad world. It's just crazy. And there are people that.
01:17:35 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So how many patients do you need to see to get that? No.
01:17:39 - Chona Sweet
How many houses could you build in the Philippines for that? Seven. saying no to this is, you know, something wrote me like I wouldn't even dare. It's not a matter of weekend, it's a matter of like, no, that one. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. will make sure that I will, there are information. Questions I need to get from him like we talk about we don't know if he's done the email yet was a plan because if not, I will just push it to just be my email in that.
01:18:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Draw that thing out for me because I can help you with that conversation and Mark, there's a saying that you can catch more flies with honey than vinegar.
01:18:23 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So there's also if you're not first, you're last and second place is the first loser and I won't and so when you are in your death bed at your end of your life, what do you think you're going to be thinking about? You know, same thing with my dad that I still work to finish because that was all the way to the last day.
01:18:41 - Chona Sweet
So that's probably what's going to be for me.
01:18:44 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I just want to be realistic. know that's up to say, but I probably agree that would probably be how I end.
01:18:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Was it happy?
01:18:54 - Chona Sweet
Yes.
01:18:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right.
01:18:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm just, I don't even know what to do with that. think I was happy. My dad was happy.
01:19:01 - Chona Sweet
He's kind of drugged up. He was drugged up at the yeah, no forgiving too much drugs that helped him to sleep.
01:19:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
that's okay.
01:19:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How's this care is rough?
01:19:14 - Chona Sweet
It's fine. We have to.
01:19:17 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
doesn't matter.
01:19:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Neither here nor there. It's only theoretical. didn't. Okay. Well, we have wasn't leadership part of our studies.
01:19:28 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What happened?
01:19:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Leadership. Remember how we discussed leadership for a long time?
01:19:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
There's also jumping in and figuring it out instead of having everything.
01:19:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just go.
01:19:40 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Just go.
01:19:42 - Chona Sweet
faster. Now, I called you before to have us call and I don't know if you can hear it from me because I'm not sure of what even to say but you just you told me you're good.
01:19:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You're good.
01:19:58 - Chona Sweet
Okay.
01:19:58 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You're good. We're fine.
01:19:59 - Chona Sweet
Everyone likes you. I mean, works out, but it's of that talk, though, Mark, can we have more of that talk?
01:20:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What? it always works out?
01:20:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, just positive, like positive.
01:20:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I, okay, I'm only you.
01:20:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We have to understand the different drivers. Everybody has different drivers. some people, like, if you say that they're going to sit on their laurels, and they're not going to do anything, and they're just going to, you know, like Tyler. Tyler? Is that the right guy? Tyler? Right. Okay. Then there's other people who will take that little bit of praise and multiply it a hundred times over, and they'll want to go get more and work their butts off. That's who you're married to. I promise you, I saw your eye roll.
01:20:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, we've also had a discussion yesterday about how just hiring people is the solution to all of your problems, and having someone else do things is not the solution to all of your problems.
01:20:58 - Chona Sweet
We talked about that one.
01:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. How's that? How's that relevant?
01:21:01 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm missing something.
01:21:04 - Chona Sweet
Because I said, he mentioned about Dr. Dr. Fuji, I asked him like, how fast does Dr. Fuji talk to his patient and telemedicine? He said five minutes. That's not enough to get the history. And Mark said he have a VA virtual assistant that gets the medical history for him, all the relevant information and the type it in. And then I said, you know, like right now my mom had a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist and they emailed her the pre, know, type in your information. But, you know, that's that was my question. And I said, maybe later on, you know, I can have someone that can do that for me, which is basically the VA. And, you know, but when we get busy, that's what is.
01:21:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When you get busy, you're going to need to do that. But right now, the more that you understand about the operations from the ground. The better you will be at hiring, leading and delegating all of that to people, but for sure, but, you know, tuck that under your cap for some energy for later is that there could be help and you can spend more time kind of strategizing and doing in the high level operations and getting some assistance, but there's timing to everything. And at the end of the day, all I'm saying, Marcus, just be more encouraging.
01:22:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I would not be putting my reputation on the line. would not be putting how much time in her in general, if I didn't believe that she could do this and do these amazing things. I'm taking away from my own energy, from my own time, my own resources, my own reputation, because I want to see her succeed and do well and achieve what she wants to achieve.
01:22:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so all I'm saying is, no matter what you say to help her, at the end of the day, you're doing great because you can measure the things that she's doing well. And if you need help measuring what she's doing well, come to me, I'll be happy to help you with that.
01:22:57 - Chona Sweet
How can I get her to go faster?
01:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm coming to LA.
01:23:01 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'll meet with all of you in person Ronan's big puzzle do it. Big Can I come hug Ronan? I know Ronan tagged both Jonah not yesterday because he hasn't seen us in a little while and he was adorable.
01:23:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just get me a plane ticket and I'm come down and visit everybody and I'm just and then slap you once and I'll take a sandwich okay bye. All right Thanks for paying attention. appreciate that show. Mr. I want to go faster. The way that you do that is do the job. Write down what it looks like. What are the numbers if he gets 400 patients like what what is the revenue to you to him? Whatever what does that look like? And then we have to figure out what does it look like operationally. So how many patients are being seen every day? How many people like who's seeing him is Jonah doing all of that. So we need the structure that you're aware, written out, I'll have follow up questions, but from there, this is how we draw the map of, it's basically the treasure map for him to look at, and you to go, do you want us to get to the treasure or do you not like.
01:24:17 - Chona Sweet
Well, he loves to.
01:24:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, so get on board with the show him what he needs, like you're going to need a shovel, you're going to map, you're going to. Exactly, exactly, but it starts with that. So if you do that, and then Chona helps me with the operational imagery, then by the time we talk next week, we've got a really solid game plan for the next conversation that you have that really should be impactful. The only way it's not going to be super helpful and get you. To do some traction with him is if he's just not actually wanting what he says he wants, but then you'll know, because if it's that in his face and clear. here. And he's still cognitive dissonance, right? Saying one thing and doing another, then you need to make a decision like, because if people can be faced with all of that and still operate contrary to what they say they want with all the evidence, that is not going to change. That's a personality trait. That's an operational trait. That's not, you know what I mean? So, but then you'll know, and you'll know very soon. So, get those visuals. You know what the assignment is now? Yes. Okay.
01:25:34 - Chona Sweet
And Shona, you? Yeah.
01:25:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And also, Tina, taxes are Ronan pictures.
01:25:42 - Chona Sweet
Very happy to receive them. Thank you.
01:25:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, you guys.
01:25:47 - Chona Sweet
Have a good night. will talk to you soon.
