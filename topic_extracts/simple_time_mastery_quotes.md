Hello.
00:00:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, how are you?
00:00:04 - Michael’s iPhone
Good, well.
00:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
are you? Good. How's the babies and the family?
00:00:10 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, it's exhausting. I forgot. I forgot how tired you could go, but I can't complain to you. You are Esther. You guys are the ones actually doing it.
00:00:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, it is a family thing that whole, it's not just a women thing, although we definitely definitely got a lot to do.
00:00:30 - Michael’s iPhone
I'm pretty sure you guys do the bulk of it.
00:00:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, I just saying it's not just stuff.
00:00:37 - Michael’s iPhone
I will agree with you, that it's all right.
00:00:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My power, power went out and all my stuff. Yeah, I had to reset everything and like log back in and load my browser windows and all of that.
00:00:53 - Michael’s iPhone
So that almost never happens.
00:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that was fun. So I'm just, I'm a little disoriented.
00:01:00 - Michael’s iPhone
to the one getting everything back up uh Mark said he hoped you got your GT4 yeah we yeah yeah it should be coming on Thursday oh okay um let's have you what's the progress on assistance or chef or anything like that oh so we found uh we found a home assistant personal it's like a task person and also to watch Mari so she's gonna come Monday through Friday from 8 to 12 or 7 30 to 12 and what we believe is that'll help us return Amazon stuff do shopping at Whole Foods our weekly uh returning things dropping you know is to UPS to kind of the tasks and then also when Esther's super tired we're gonna give her Mari for the morning and then she'll bottle feed Mari for the 8 o'clock and the 11 o'clock feeds and then let Esther sleep in or just do whatever she needs to do and then at 12 o'clock Esther will take over as usual for the rest of the day and yeah and then I usually come back and finish work about five so I'll take over or help out at five so we're gonna start there I love that plan my stinking AI note taker is also not letting me highlight so I just want to make sure I get that so 12 o'clock to noon um yeah we're gonna do it above board too you know a lot of them we want to just cash and I you know I'm in position where I don't really feel like I want to do that and risk that so we're just gonna do it above board we're paying her 35 an hour which is a premium but yes but then uh then we could do it above board pair, like a normal W2, like legally, we're supposed to, and then be done with it. Because yeah, I think I could find a cheaper person, like 25 30, but they all wanted cash. And I was like, I don't want to risk that, you get hurt, and then you sue me. Yes.
00:03:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But also, it doesn't, I, have you considered 1099 instead of W2?
00:03:21 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, we looked at, I actually, we have an employment lawyer, and we talked about it. But if they're coming to my house, it's pretty much W2. Unless they're doing tasks like cooking, specific cleaning, but if it's like, every morning, eight to 12, like on a schedule, and it's, uh, it's tough.
00:03:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, the schedule.
00:03:39 - Michael’s iPhone
It's only, it's, it's excuse us that that becomes an issue. But I was just like, I don't even want to, don't want to go in that. Yeah.
00:03:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And are you hiring her as an LLC or like a corporation?
00:03:54 - Michael’s iPhone
That's kind of a personal corporation. It's weird. Like, yeah, I set it up through Poppins payroll, so they specialize in
00:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
housekeeper payroll well what I'm asking is like are you using the are you minimizing liability as much as possible in your corporate structure no is that something that you consider maybe wanting to do that's a good point you mean like corporation hire yeah I mean even just an LLC is still you don't have to deal with unemployment you don't have to deal with any of that stuff although if you're doing W2 that's probably financially the best way to organize it in terms of protection from getting sued especially if that corporation solely exists for home operations type stuff rather than you know any of your other business so that its assets are minimized the her ability to sue you is minimized But also, you have to pay unemployment with W2. You have to do all of those things anyway. So an S-Corp really isn't gonna add any more burden, but it should give you some more protection. And also, there are things that you can do to protect your money and an S-Corp that you can't do and other things like hiring the kids, paying that type of stuff.
00:05:23 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, we already passed through one of the Corps. So yeah, actually, maybe if we made it sort of like an executive bonus. I'm gonna look into my accountant. Actually, that's a really good point. Maybe if we put another layer of liability besides just the work of insurance.
00:05:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thanks, y'all, look at that. Every week, I'm gonna look for a way to be valuable.
00:05:44 - Michael’s iPhone
We'll try. I hadn't even thought of it. Yeah, because what I had talked to my accountant was like, hey, can I use business expenses to pay for this? And they're like, no, that's sketchy, like, don't do that. But if we're doing it for liability, we're essentially, we're giving the childcare, you know, as a executive perk to me and Esther. Yeah, but not trying to claim a tax deduction. I think that would be in just for essentially liability.
00:06:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, let me ask. That's great. Thanks. And also that, to the point of the type of people that you want to have in your life, having somebody who is good at wealth management and wealth advice, there's a big difference between accounting and wealth management. So the difference between multi-millionaires and billionaires think very, very differently. So anyway, something to keep in mind. All right, let's write that down. Okay, so 12th noon, you rattled off the task from me really quick.
00:06:42 - Michael’s iPhone
I would really like them one more time if you don't mind. Yeah, so she's going to work from 8 or 7.30 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. So the biggest things is like the weekly or by week or twice a week grocery shopping, returning Amazon things to Whole Foods or UPS stores. dropping off packages we want to send to UPS, USGS, or FedEx, and doing just random, you know, we need diapers, please go to Target, you know, stuff that we can't easily order online. So those are like the tasks. And then, under that house cleaning, she's going to do, we're going to have the housekeeper continue coming every other week. But she's going to do maintenance of the dishes in the kitchen, which is what Ester and I were driving us crazy. So she's going to do the dishes in the kitchen. She's going to help us with the laundry. I want to say my laundry because I have more than Ester and, you know, washing and folding my laundry and, you know, a light bathroom cleaning around mostly the toilets. And then, as a backup, if Ester's tired, she's going to have bottle seed Mari for the morning and just focus on Mari for the morning.
00:07:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. how did you find her?
00:07:59 - Michael’s iPhone
do you know about that? The value is like let's just explore that conversation a little bit so I'm familiar with it. Yeah, so I just started asking my neighbors, hey, you know, we're looking for a housekeeper, do you guys know anything? And then this lady actually came to our attention because she babysits our next next door neighbors to kids. She's been doing it for five years. And now they're both going to school in the morning, so she has no work in the morning. So they said, hey, you know, it'd be perfect if you guys took her in the morning and then, you know, obviously we'll do like normally act. so we had to talk with her Esther and then me and then also my my mom, my grandma was very skeptical. So we all talked to her and then we're actually going to talk to the my neighbor today little later today. going get on the call and just kind of bet her a little more. But yeah, that's that was kind of a process.
00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it hasn't started yet, but you're you're right there making that decision.
00:08:59 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, September 1st is when. And the kids at school starts when she'll have time to start with us permanently.
00:09:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's a very good day. That's the day Tina was born.
00:09:07 - Michael’s iPhone
So I put good blessing. Nine one in 1991, right?
00:09:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nineteen seventy six year of the dragon.
00:09:16 - Michael’s iPhone
I have no shame.
00:09:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I earned every strike. Every strike. Um, OK, so how will she roughly?
00:09:28 - Michael’s iPhone
Does she have kids? She's two kids there in Guatemala. They're fully grown. Actually, I'm sorry, they're in San Diego. They've brought their families from Guatemala. Her kids are in San Diego.
00:09:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so how old are the kids that she was babysitting?
00:09:49 - Michael’s iPhone
Four and six, I believe now. Four and seven, something like that.
00:09:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And what kind of family are your neighbors?
00:10:00 - Michael’s iPhone
Two lawyers, they're two stay at home lawyers.
00:10:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so the reason I'm asking is because it speaks to level of expectations. You know what I mean? If people in certain industries, you already know there's going to be a certain level of competence required, ability to communicate, ability to work autonomously. Generally speaking, higher level professions have low tolerance for stupid mistakes, especially on repeat. True. Right, so if they're both attorneys, even if they're not the most high-performing, there's a certain amount of effort you have to do just to get through a law school and medical school, right? So the odds that she's highly incompetent, or you know what I mean? Just because somebody refers you, somebody doesn't mean it's a good referral, but similar ages, similar neighborhood, which is going to be similar of a sort, income levels. You know what I mean?
00:11:01 - Michael’s iPhone
There's so many things that go into that So that's super hopeful and I'd like We've actually seen her at like the park with the two kids before like I've seen her multiple times that like the parks and Yeah, so every time I've seen her like she's not on the phone. She's not like texting, know She's always like watching the kids.
00:11:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that Yeah, that was a big thing too.
00:11:26 - Michael’s iPhone
We we had seen her. I so that's why we're gonna talk to the lawyer the owner today because We don't know how she's you know in the house Seen her in the house. I've only seen her in the park. Um, yeah, and what you have nanny cams We we thought about that we haven't Because mostly because estu is gonna be in the house kind of like the lawyers work Um, but yeah, we're thinking of that Well, um most of the services have apps and you can have sketch
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
tools where you can turn things on and off. So privacy mode, like if you only want it to be on during the hours that she's there, do a little research first and find something that you can just schedule beyond during this time. If you don't want the footage, you can save it to a cloud or an SD card so that it's not in the cloud and your privacy is your privacy, that type of but, you know, when it comes to your children, safety, things like that, something to consider. Also liability, if anything ever happens, you've got evidence and nobody wants to be that person, nobody wants to think about that, but after the fact is too late. Also, we all tend to be on better behavior when we know we're being watched and it doesn't matter or cause an effect, chicken and egg, it doesn't matter. Whatever draws us out to be better people draws us out to be better people.
00:12:54 - Michael’s iPhone
So it's like the switch, it's like switch, the housekeeper to know, like make it easier for her. to be on her best behavior, right? Like, that's what the book talked about is like, yeah, like, who knows if it's forcing her or it's like, you know, whatever, it doesn't matter. Like, the end result is she's going to be a little bit better because she is being watched. Like, yeah, I like that.
00:13:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ah, look at that. We're applying switch.
00:13:20 - Michael’s iPhone
I like your book. I'm going to read that book. Like you said, it's short. I think I'm going to, I will read it four times because it's just a very, like, basic, easy to understand, like, makes sense concepts. And, yeah, I'm going to read it four because it's anecdotal, the stories pop out in your head.
00:13:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, that's the thing that's been amazing to me. I only read it once. I should go back and reread it. But I, the details of the stories that pop in my head and how frequently they do, I reference it probably several times a year. There's only a few books that I do that, which you would think it'd be more than that. But I can't say that about most books or anything that I've read. a single source that has multiple applications and that's one of them so that's why I don't recommend a ton of books but I gave one a mark today also that I haven't read for like 12 years probably called EMIF and that would be good for you to read as well I just think it's a good overall business book but it is about structure I have read that I think I have read that book it has like a really a lot of words on the cover it's like the EMIF yeah I read that I don't remember what the premise was it was about sales it was more about how many structure and maturity and menu items so for example you can't go to McDonald's and order a filet mignon because even if they wanted to go to the store get it for you and you said you were going to pay him $200 to do they're not going to be good at it you don't know what you're going to get because that's not what they do over and over again, but they want to be the best at what they have. So these are the limited items yet. Right.
00:15:08 - Michael’s iPhone
Was it even mastery or something?
00:15:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Revisited.
00:15:12 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. Yeah. haven't read that. Yeah. That's what it was.
00:15:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Even if revisited. Okay.
00:15:17 - Michael’s iPhone
That's great. I'll pick that up and get it on book on tape. I do remember I liked it a lot. I don't remember. Yeah.
00:15:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then also talk about IBM. I think that was e-book, Emeth and they talk about org charts and that IBM was kind of unique in that it was born as a mature company. So it talks about companies from teens or like newborn stages and then beginner right and then teenage and then a mature company. And a mature company has SOPs has an org chart. It has all of these things, very specific functions, very specific seats and roles that perform each of those functions. functions and that type of thing. And it has been so long, so I have to go back and ask myself what I will.
00:16:05 - Michael’s iPhone
I will already totally read it.
00:16:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, it's okay. You don't have to do I do. I need to because because it is one of those ones that I it's a it's a staple. There are certain staples that that I like to reference. And it's because they're foundational concepts like switch those concepts. You can use them for almost every type of decision that you have to make that is high impact, right? Who you hire, how you hire, how you choose your how much time you're going to work, where you're going to work, that type of thing. Because it gives you a structural concept framework to run your decisions through. So switch does that.
00:16:59 - Michael’s iPhone
And think no, no, I'll really. For sure, I do remember it.
00:17:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, okay, okay, so I'm excited.
00:17:05 - Michael’s iPhone
I forgot Yay, I love it. I love it when people are excited and they when I read over and over it is Peter Teal is zero to one It's about like starting a new business or thinking about like a product that you want off That's the one I've read like price five times now That's the one but but it has like the same thing like you're saying and like switch very simple concepts Like things like a checklist to go through in my mind. Like is this even a good idea, you know, so okay?
00:17:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'll do that. I love that love that Okay, so we're starting off with an assistant and she is going to tackle dishes every day Yeah, through Friday Right. Well, that's what I meant.
00:17:49 - Michael’s iPhone
Sorry Monday through Friday The hard thing that Esther and I talked about is like Esther doesn't like leaving the kitchen dirty at night And so we're trying to like she thinks she would be okay and we're trying it for like a week because it's just very foreign to her like you've stuck in the kitchen sink overnight so yeah but she has just very skill like but I think yes just come around she's like let me try it you know we'll try it for two weeks see if I could like handle that she doesn't like going to sleep with the kitchen and mess I mean I get it but you know if you know help is coming in the morning that I feel like maybe we can try it and see and something that you can help her with this is is it because you know that in the morning you're gonna have to face that duty and you don't want to start your day thinking with that that is on your on your plate so it isn't that there are dishes in the sink it's that there are dishes in the sink that you have to deal with first thing in the morning or look at all day so if you because yeah no I actually talked to her but I did I asked her the question it was because in childhood she would get that she didn't have a great childhood she who would get yelled at if things weren't aligned. So now she makes sure things are aligned. That's the reason. And she even said, I get it. That's my reasoning. But it's hard to break that and go to sleep with that purpose.
00:19:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For that purpose, maybe ask her to commit to just 30 days. 30 days, draw how she feels progressively. But here's the thing. Our decisions should feed our values because of our priorities. Our priorities are from our values, not someone else's. And so the way to loosen ourselves from the past is to break the responses that we have as a result of them. So if it was really Esther's vow. use rather than a fear response. Um, that wouldn't have been what she said.
00:20:06 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. So she's still she's still making it about a fear response rather than about her own.
00:20:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is to not give it any power anymore.
00:20:18 - Michael’s iPhone
So I like to practice taking the power away from dishes shouldn't have that power over her. That's right. I like that.
00:20:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She needs your coaching. I'm here. Um, but we can do this. But this is, this is why I talk about the holistic approach stuff. Because yeah, she can help her.
00:20:41 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah. If she could make that like if I could just put like a little bit of a carrot and be like, Hey, why don't you focus on your values? What do you want? Do you want the dishes to hold that power of fear over you? And if I could just get her just a little switch try it for 30 days, then it'll make our lives better at night. could focus on the kids at night instead of, you know, washing dishes.
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
for 45 minutes.
00:21:01 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, you know, we might cook more right because you don't cook because we're so afraid of all the plate, you know, the pots and pans, so like that might be better. So yeah, I love this. I'll give her just that little nugget and see if she'll try it for 30 days and then see if it makes her feel better.
00:21:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Great. So there's one more additional power in that because if you take that fear that came from the past. And if she's able to, you know, loosen its power, what other things is she's still doing because of childhood wounds? And what other hold can be broken? So because if you learn that you can break a hold, then you learn that you can break all the holes. Okay, yeah. I'll look around.
00:21:52 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah. And she's a wonderful person. Like she actually goes to therapy, she works on the different, you know, she knows she has. as bad things and she works on them and you know she believes that some people don't think they can change but she believes she can change so yeah it's been really good.
00:22:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's amazing but the other thing is our partners see things differently than us and we can't see all the things all the time and you can't do all the things all the time so this is where leverage comes in what are those things that have the greatest amount of power for good or bad so in our business in our lives we want to create the powerful levers but we need to undo the bad lovers the one that if I go to bed and the dishes are in there that I could have a bad night's sleep that I could wake up bad because of dishes now I like a clean house I I the energy my productivity my happiness is very much tied to it but having had four kids and being single and running a business and doing all of those things I had to let certain things go and and I got help, you know, around the house and learned it. But I have to let, I can let things go in the moment. So my overall value of cleanliness has not diminished, but the power that I give it when it's out of alignment for the moment is also diminished, because I'm like, it will be solved. I have a system in place to solve it. I don't need to worry about you. You take no more mental space.
00:23:25 - Michael’s iPhone
So anyway. Yeah, I love that.
00:23:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Astronies you. I'm I'm looking for about two or three more clients to be full, especially as we're going into fall, because I want to be dizzier when my girls, they don't need me as much anymore. They're teenagers like growing up and they're moving out. And I'm like, I need to take care of other people. So if you know somebody, let me know. OK, so we'll get into your sleep stuff. But this is a pivotal thing. Can you guys hire this person?
00:23:56 - Michael’s iPhone
OK, so let me know. think so too. I'm really like, I don't like to hope a whole lot, but like I'm like, man, I think if everything checks out with her background within, you know, the old, the lawyer that I'm going to talk to, and I'm really like, man, this could be great. So, yeah, we'll see. I'll let you know in September.
00:24:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Optimism is powerful.
00:24:17 - Michael’s iPhone
It's powerful. It's good.
00:24:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've learned to be cautiously optimistic, but I used to try to hold back my optimism, because a lot of things wouldn't go the way that I wanted to. But instead, what I've shifted that to is instead of holding the expectation specifically of it will be this way, my expectation is it will be improved and it will be better. Because of the specific thing that I did, or because something else revealed itself along the way, or because I failed at this part and I learned and I'm a step closer to actually doing it right. Either way, I lose. And so there's nothing to not be optimistic about because I'm a step closer.
00:25:00 - Michael’s iPhone
Regardless, I think I think like that almost about everything too optimistic, but yeah, that's how I think of it too Relined Okay, okay, so watching folding that's it.
00:25:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a huge amount of stuff I'm super excited about that because we haven't really gotten to the business stuff yet But we came in with a baby and pending now the big is here now.

00:26:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, it's just, yeah, I love it. to me about how often you've been going, like, has there been an increase in frequency? Um, just just give me a little more detail.
00:26:21 - Michael’s iPhone
Well, the baby's been tough, but I think, uh, last Monday, I started going, again, I'm trying to go three times a week. So like Monday, Wednesday, Saturday or Monday, Wednesday, Sunday, it's just every week's different. So I've been trying to go at least three times a week. So oh, it's just great. Yeah. Glad we paid for access. This was wonderful. Best $200 I've spent.
00:26:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

00:26:47 - Michael’s iPhone
love that you phrased it that way.
00:26:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
told me to.
00:26:50 - Michael’s iPhone
like that. I know.
00:26:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know. But just because, just because I did that doesn't mean that that stuck in your mind and that because when you say it, you give it your own. on power. It's not because I said it. It's because you bought into it and now it becomes yours.
00:27:05 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, I would pay $50 a class to choke someone out.
00:27:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thanks. I think I need to do it too. I'm just a lot more calm everywhere when I do get a little, you know, rustling out of me. Yes. to that point, hold on, let me make sure I want to write that down. We talked about energy sandwiches a little bit when you've got some stressful things or you've got those like back-to-back meetings and things just jumping down and knocking out some push-ups or something to get attention out.
00:27:42 - Michael’s iPhone
Has that ever come up yet? I've been working so little the last two weeks. I really haven't done much work in general. Tomorrow, would say Monday. start working on Wednesday. So Wednesday will be, I'll be working again. So yeah, I mean, the things that I have got done, like the mission critical stuff, it's not really bothersome to me. It's like 20 minutes here, 20 minutes there, and then I get it done. But I haven't really tried to enter just that one yet.
00:28:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's cool. And really, like I said, I think the foundational piece is, and we have to sleep yet, but we'll get to sleep. But is getting your home situation, like you just entered the new season. It's not just two kids, but it's infant all over again.
00:28:35 - Michael’s iPhone
So yeah, this is very, very very Like our, I could already see like our time is gonna be, well, maybe not so much me actually, but Esther's time's gonna be vastly different. So there's a couple things on her business that I'm gonna probably pick up the slack on a little bit, you know, to help her because, yeah, now this is gonna be, it's gonna be all hands on deck for her for the next six not so. Yep, is what it is.
00:29:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so that I understand where your brain is going, what type of work would you be doing?
00:29:12 - Michael’s iPhone
On the Q and E work.
00:29:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I said, okay, when you say Esther stuff, then you mean in your business?
00:29:19 - Michael’s iPhone
Well, Esther runs her own billing company.
00:29:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She bills for my Q and E work, but we segment it. Got it.
00:29:27 - Michael’s iPhone
And so there's, there are things that I'm totally, I just shut off. I'm just black and white. I'm like, nope, that's, that's the billing company. That's hers and her manager. And I don't think about it at all. Literally, I walk into my Q and E. I interview the guy. I write my report. I send it to them. They take care of the rest. But now I think there are things I'm going to step in that she was doing that I'm just going to pick up a little bit more slack on. And just help out a little part.
00:29:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And before the baby, how many hours a week was as
00:30:00 - Michael’s iPhone
So working in her business roughly for she did she did a meeting on Tuesday, one on Friday, like an hour, maybe hour to a paperwork, but she has a wonderful manager, okay, you know, in the manager, a pretty good premium to be our manager. Basically, take everything off Esther's plate. The thing that Esther still has to do is just little things that are just very ownership related, I think. Okay.
00:30:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the manager can't help you with that type of stuff in for QME?
00:30:35 - Michael’s iPhone
Well, that's, that's what I'm going to, I'm going to help the manager do a little more. But like, I want my wording a certain way. And so that's the part I'm going to step in and like work with the manager instead of Esther and the manager on doing.
00:30:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Watch it.
00:30:59 - Michael’s iPhone
All right. my wording for how you can't advertise what I do legally, but I can say, I've done this, I've done this work, I've done this kind of case, as you could say, the truth. You just can't say, I'm the best, I will, know. So that's the point.
00:31:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One of the things that you could do to just just a thought, and it is just a this, not that document?
00:31:22 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
00:31:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Make that very clear. Okay. Yeah. Because if you give examples, and if you give enough examples so that she can understand this language evokes liability, this one doesn't. This one is a claim.
00:31:40 - Michael’s iPhone
is a statement. You know what I mean?
00:31:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. evidence based, that type of thing. So that's the point.
00:32:00 - Michael’s iPhone
is what helps somebody be able to see the correlation.
00:32:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if she's intelligent enough, if this is not that type of thing, we should be more helpful. Love it. Yeah, that's something simple. And then astronaut can work on that too. I could just talk to Esther about it. And then yeah, I can come up with that.
00:32:17 - Michael’s iPhone
That's great. Yeah. Okay, cool.
00:32:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Again, always leverage.
00:32:22 - Michael’s iPhone
whatever we can do to find some leverage and optimize the little things that you do, then you've got more mental effort for the big things. Big rocks, right? Yep, that makes sense. Okay, let me...
00:32:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so did you start using the Food Journal app yet?
00:32:38 - Michael’s iPhone
Yep, I believe I sent it to you. Tina at Profit.
00:32:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I documented it through Sunday. Okay, hold on a second.
00:32:50 - Michael’s iPhone
And separately, I sent the weekly report to your email.
00:32:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know which one you prefer, but I sent the Dailys and the weekly. You should only have one email from me, I think, but...
00:33:02 - Michael’s iPhone
As Tina, I imported it to Tina at Profit Drivers. that's me.
00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a user report. Okay.
00:33:02 - Michael’s iPhone
Um, all right. Well, that's good. So that's in macros. Let's take a look at this. And then I was shocked. Like, I thought I over eat all the time. Esther thinks I underneath, but I was shocked that like, I'm pretty close to 2000, whatever that limit is that 2000 calories a day.
00:33:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, yeah, but do you know what your BMR is? I don't know what the BMR is. Basic metabolic rate. Like what? No idea.
00:33:29 - Michael’s iPhone
Burn on average per day.
00:33:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they calculated it by your age, height, your weight. I'm not even sure if height is in it, but that's what I put in there.
00:33:40 - Michael’s iPhone
And then that's what they said, like whatever that number is 2000. Okay.
00:33:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what's your, oh, your budget is 2020.
00:33:44 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay.
00:33:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you're not trying to wait a minute. Correct. Okay. I'm trying to.
00:33:50 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. So then that's, that's probably what that is. That's very low.
00:33:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm a hundred and twenty two pounds. So it's a fairly low. That makes sense. Okay. Um, but what is your activity level? Like I would think that you're more active than you would need more calories than that because of Jiu-Jitsu.
00:34:09 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, actually you could see that like on the days that I did Jiu-Jitsu, I actually think I ate more that like I had a snack because I was just like dying.
00:34:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if you're actually under a little bit, but maybe not. So, and sometimes it comes down to macros and digestion and body energy, whatever. the whole, the whole point of it is just getting some more and I shouldn't end just seeing. So let me look at that.
00:34:38 - Michael’s iPhone
sounds great. never done that before, but I started tracking and I was like, oh, okay, I guess I am pretty close to the 2000 thing.
00:34:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I think your protein is low.
00:34:49 - Michael’s iPhone
And protein is low.
00:34:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because on average, just to maintain your muscle level and your weight. I would. say you probably need at least 100 grams of protein every day. So it's only a little bit under because you're averaging. Well, it should be, that would be, wait, seven days, yeah, 700, and you're at 663 for the week. So probably a little bit under, but we were already talking about more protein and probably you sleep at night. Unless it was fat and protein, because the things that you were eating weren't just high on protein, but they were also high in fat hot dogs, pizza. What was the other thing that comes? yeah, yeah, yeah, saturated fat specifically, which we definitely don't want to have more of. But I don't know what is the concoction that's helping you sleep better. Was it was it the protein? Was it fat? Was it protein and fat? So that's something to start really looking at is what is your, what is your your last meal of the day? So these are macros. That's helpful. I would really like to see the mark. specifically of the last meal of the day. And you can look at that in the log, go lose it. Dash or let's see, no log. Okay, so dinner, if you click on the dinner, let's say, go to yesterday's dinner.
00:36:21 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay.
00:36:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if you click on it, you should be able to see all.
00:36:30 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, view meal summary. There it is, new meal summary.
00:36:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yeah. So we want that just every day, and then we'll make a correlation of that between sleep. want to look at everything overall, too, so we can just kind of see when you do start making some changes, just what it kind of has an impact on your, like, brain fog sleep performance mood. Yeah, but, but that last meal of the day. So let's go look at. your sleep stuff.
00:37:03 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh yeah did you do I so I changed the document the old ones called outdated and I put a new one called spreadsheet.
00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm quite proud of it I think it looks a lot better. Okay. Do you report weekly report? Was it no that's not the weekly report. Let me just I'm just gonna forward it because I'm looking under use specifically and I don't see it. There it goes. I came through.
00:37:41 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah that didn't come through.
00:37:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
for whatever reason I didn't come through before. look at that restful sleep. That seems like it's improved.
00:38:01 - Michael’s iPhone
Well, that's because Esther this week started letting me miss the two evening feeds, so that's what I've been getting a chunk of restful sleep.
00:38:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but your first week, like before the baby came, this is even better than that.
00:38:18 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, that's that.
00:38:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is, I mean, let's go to outdated. Shush, see if I have the original slide, whoops, the first one, yeah, oh, that was an apple lot, because the first week you didn't have that, and we're tracks differently. So I don't have apples to compare, but either way, let me. I do like this better. Why is it better? don't know, but it looks better. I can see everything. That's why. Good job. I put it bar.
00:39:14 - Michael’s iPhone
I put like the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. But it's actually weird because Monday is actually looking at Sunday night sleep. Right. It's like baby for sleep. I remember that.
00:39:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:39:27 - Michael’s iPhone
So. Is there a way to look better now?
00:39:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:39:30 - Michael’s iPhone
Thank you. I'm quite proud of Good job.
00:39:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Somewhat rested. Oh, good. tagged how you felt. That's good. And that would be helpful to review too.
00:39:42 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, no. That's not antagonizing.
00:39:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the sleep tracker assumption. Oh, okay.
00:39:49 - Michael’s iPhone
Um. What is the app you told me?
00:39:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sleep watchers. Yeah. It does have a function to where you can set it to ask you how rested you felt. felt during the day or how fatigued you felt, so I don't remember what the language is, but I think it's fatigued.
00:40:07 - Michael’s iPhone
I'm just very happy these last three weeks. I've actually worn my ordering, worn my Apple watch to get the data. So yeah, it's getting incrementally better on our data. Okay, I'll try to I'll try to enable how like how do I feel when I wake up?
00:40:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not just how you feel when you wake up, but how do you feel middle of the day? Okay, good.
00:40:34 - Michael’s iPhone
I'm sorry, in the journal, I was making notes of that. Sorry, you out again. Oh, I was noting some of that in my journal vlogs. My daily journal.
00:40:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did I have a really hard time writing?
00:40:58 - Michael’s iPhone
Sorry.
00:40:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see. Oh, It's a little bit better though, but it's also it's hard to go through that and find just the specific things that I'm looking for. So if you open your sleepwatch app, let me, let see what this says, sleep. There is a, let's see, is it for the setting, the course?
00:41:24 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, you know what? It's funny now that I open it. so I don't open this app every day. only open it when I send you the documents. Oh, okay. So actually, it literally, right now, it's just like, how well rested did you feel?
00:41:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, okay, I'll start welling this in. Okay. Yeah. maybe I'll have it allow notifications. Because that will be the thing that will pop up in the middle of day. How fatigued are you? Okay.
00:41:57 - Michael’s iPhone
Allow notifications.
00:41:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it. I'll think of it. Yeah. I'll play around with little. That's the whole thing, right? That's the iterations of it's a little bit here, a little bit there. So we're going to get the, let me just get back to my notes. So we need evening, macro, log reports, added to the...
00:42:23 - Michael’s iPhone
So maybe the best way for that is to take a screenshot, because I don't know, but I don't can get it. don't know if get all that way. Yep, screenshot would be perfect.
00:42:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
okay. And we don't have to do this forever, but a few weeks of figuring out, okay, what is all the data that's pertinent? What is the report that's giving us the pertinent data? Review it for a while, make some changes, and then, you know, do this exercise again in a few months and see how you're doing. Or... or if an issue pops up, or if you're like, I'm actually sticking really good, all these things are good, then we wanna go look and go, okay, what was the thing? So we're not gonna be digging into this, like this deep for such a long time. We're basically getting a baseline right now, making a very small plan for whatever you want to do, right? Cause you don't wanna have like a diet overall or anything like that. So this is just data, and then knowing what are the things that impact you? So when you're like, I need to do something different, this is not working, then you know what things are gonna have an impact on it. Okay. I like it. All right. I'm so excited that you found somebody.
00:43:40 - Michael’s iPhone
You don't get to start till September. I know. She said, you know, we could do some trial runs with her on the weekends and give Esther wants to get out. So we might actually do that and just trial runs or something. What about if in the meantime, you have your cleaner come every week? Yeah. Yeah, we've talked. to about that. This goes back to the thing I we don't really like our cleaner and Mark actually suggested. Yeah she's just a little, well I talked to I actually talked to Mark about this and our house is like little bit larger so there's a lot and Mark was saying maybe make like you know like that list you were saying for my manager or the feeling like Mark was saying why don't you make a list like that for your cleaners so it's like do this at minimum and then at least we'll be like happy yeah because right now she misses the window like not the window sills but when you open a window she misses the inner groove and Mark was like yeah but for a 3000 square foot house like unfortunately you're probably gonna have to tell her to like hit that so I was like okay so yeah that's maybe that's another thing I'll work on I'll talk to Esther about leaving the dishes till tomorrow and then also I'll work with her on creating a list for the cleaner and see if it works. And if it does, then we can increase it.
00:45:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because that's just like, I don't want to pay this person every week. I'm just like, OK.
00:45:08 - Michael’s iPhone
And you can change it every week.
00:45:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I have my cleaning list. It's just a Google Doc.
00:45:16 - Michael’s iPhone
And oh, you have a list.
00:45:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can I have it?
00:45:18 - Michael’s iPhone
I mean, it probably wouldn't be relevant to you because I have a working on.
00:45:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So she also is great at organizing like a Marie Kondo type thing. And so I've got her working on projects plus my baseline cleaning because I also have two teenage girls that want money from me. So they've got to earn it. So our doctors are going to be super different. But what I do is I tell her, OK, these are the things that need to get done monthly. These are the things that need to get done quarterly. And then here are the weekly projects. These are the must-dos. So if you're running low on energy or time or whatever, these are the things you must-do first.
00:45:56 - Michael’s iPhone
Or I'm not going to be happy. OK.
00:45:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. But thanks.
00:46:01 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah.
00:46:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But then she has to go update the report and she'll tell me what she got done and anything that she noticed. if I'm out of the cleaning supply, if something took longer because there was an issue or she noticed something that I wasn't aware of, so put that in the report and then also confirm the amount of time that it's worked. So, you know, like if she leaves early, I want to know if she works longer, I want to know whatever that type of thing. So, yeah. So we've got the cleaning and then we've got the project that you know you don't get to the projects until the cleaning is done.
00:46:39 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay.
00:46:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cool. Yes.
00:46:42 - Michael’s iPhone
Yes.
00:46:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's the thing, the documentation and any type of business or where there's an expectation of another person that's working for you. It just helps. First of all, it's a paper trail. It's clear. expectations. And in a Google Doc, you can view the history. So let's say somebody goes and like, oops, I deleted it. Well, you've got version history. You can go back and see every version of the document ever. So you can say, well, she said, Oh, well, it didn't say that then. What day was that? Let me go back and check.
00:47:19 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, actually, yes, it did. It said it on that day.
00:47:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you know, it's accountability. And that goes back to the nanny cam and help people do their best. So, but it makes you be accountable. And this is the thing I was talking to you about before, making sure that you're being a good leader and a good boss by being clear. And so if the documentation says, which he didn't really tell me what I needed to do, he said this, this was not very clear. He said this and this is going to take three hours. And I did this because I only had two. So this doesn't make any sense, right? then now we know there's a communication issue and nobody addressed it. So who owns that? Does she own it? Do you own it? That type of thing. So, Oh, anyway, it's a, it's a hard process.
00:48:03 - Michael’s iPhone
I'm excited.
00:48:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This would be great.
00:48:05 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. think we're going to make a big difference, didn't you? Yeah, we've been meeting to do that list, like Mark said, but I think it's more specific list. That'd be great. We'll do it.
00:48:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that goes back to big rocks. First things first. So the big rock is, is, is really that the communication is clear and the expectations are clear. Because almost always when there's an offense or a problem, it's because expectations weren't meant. And usually when expectations are met, it's because expectations weren't clearly set in the first place thoroughly in all encompassing.
00:48:45 - Michael’s iPhone
Please make that a note. Esther has been telling me that for years and I agree, like when I lose my , that's exactly what Esther tells me. she's like, did you set the expectations for your person that you're frustrated? I'm like, no. Oh, but it's a common thing I you hit a nail on a head right there and please remember to keep challenging me when you sense frustration about Something just as we work together. Um, yeah, please know that's a huge problem. I have and I am trying to work on it, but What you just said when I get frustrated, I should probably turn inwards and be like, did I send my expectations right? they know how to please me? Yeah. Um, But great point.
00:49:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
good. need to do that. Yeah, yeah and um Another thought as I've been working on my like psychology. Did you agree? I'm like, man, I think we always have to be learning I wish everybody was learning because we just sometimes just get really complacent but um Just understanding what the mechanics of certain things are anxiety is basically the fear of the unknown That leads into expectations, right? If expectations aren't clearly said, I don't even know how I can satisfy them, do you know what I mean? So, think about working for somebody who you want to please and you ask them what they want and they told you and the tone that they use is, okay, this conversation is done and I'm going to tell you, you have that tone, I plow through it. It's not a bad thing, but you're like, the way that, okay, so if I do this, oh yeah, okay, that makes sense and I'm leaning in and I'm looking you and I'm pausing, there's potentially room to continue the conversation, right? You're like, oh yeah, that makes sense. What does that mean? How would you read that?
00:50:48 - Michael’s iPhone
I'd be like, okay, well the next time you do it, you better do it exactly right, otherwise there's going to be an issue there.
00:50:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Most people, and especially in a subordinate position. would take that as you just wave me off this is done you physically you physically make a signal a subordinate is most of them are going to take that as a that was dismissed this conversation probably should be over they don't want to hear more about it I have to watch when I do that and it's not necessarily a bad thing it's okay moving on but it is very much a signal of moving on when you're working especially with women first of all generally speaking they have to be very good at body language and signals women are raised differently but but you you learn you learn the environment you learn where you fit in what you're to do and women tend to just fall in line with that. So when I've been trying to hire and train assistants and autonomous leaders, I have to get them to push past those signals. And it takes years to do. And not all of them can do it. here's the crazy thing. It takes years to do, even with their boss, right here, saying yes, please tell me what to do. Yes, please probe. Yes, please hold me accountable. Yes, please ask me why I didn't do what I said I was going to do. Even with that, it takes a couple of years to get them to do it. And even still, they're like, I feel like I'm being bad. feel like I'm being pushy. feel like I'm being bitchy. feel like I'm, you know, like, and it's annoying people. So.
00:52:52 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, I got, I, I'll watch that next time I talk to, uh, I'm not going to have a conversation by manager today, actually, so. Well, we do it on the phone, but yeah, I'm sure there's signals that I give them on the phone room like, okay, done. Let's go. What are we doing next?
00:53:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's not really true. So what that you could do is just go, was there anything else you wanted to talk about that now? Okay. I'm also big on call control. I don't want it repeated. If you've told me the same thing twice, I don't want to hear it again. I don't, I got it the first time. And so I'm not telling you it's a bad thing. And I do the same thing, but I have to be aware of, okay, I have to catch myself in it and go, did I hear what you needed to tell me? Did we address the issue in full? Are you clear? Am I clear? If we're clear, let's move on. We don't need to keep talking about it. But if you're not clear, then, and I'm your boss, then I need to sit there until you get clear. So here's the other aspect of it. If you can't get clear quickly, and you frequently can't, get clear quickly, you got to go. I got to replace you.
00:54:03 - Michael’s iPhone
Interesting. Interesting. You know, yeah, okay. Yeah, you know, when my manager, we get clear real quick with him. And I feel like we're on the same page, but some of the people we've hired that he managed is when I talked to them, I'm like, and I think that probably drives my body language when I talked to them because I'm like, okay, we said it, let's go, but it always takes me. Yeah, I'm just like, I don't know if we got it.
00:54:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know that. So, yeah, interesting. But but but then you have to ask yourself what's the talent pool possible that somebody can meet me at this level with what I'm willing to pay them. So then you have to decide what is the Are you going to take that amount of time every single time you have to get clear with them? Or are you going to go pay two, three, times as much? So you've got somebody who's just going and doing the thing. So there's always trade-offs. You just want to be consciously making sure that you've made the choice and then be in it because you're dealing with people. So if you have to explain concepts and it takes somebody three or four times longer than you want it to, but once they get it, they get it and they do the job, they're reliable, they're loyal, you know, they're lot of them. Then that is a trade-off that you consciously and willingly make and then you need to tell yourself, okay, I just got to calm down, sit back. Once you've gone through this, like, are you clear? And then you can practice, how do you get clear? What do they need? That makes it more clear. Do they need visuals? Because in your mind, here's the other thing. I haven't said this to anybody for a long time because I keep my clients along, that I don't have to train new people, but a lot of times people have more than half of the conversation going on in their head and only like 20% of it comes out. So you've got a full picture of what you want going on here and you've given instructions and they hear the instructions, but they don't see the whole picture. So that's where lists, examples, not that type of thing is helpful because now you've helped them get a picture and maybe they can't fully see the picture of what it is, but they can see a picture of what it's not because you gave examples.
00:56:44 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. Esther literally had this conversation because of us about how I was like Whitsen, my manager and I were both that are Whitsen with this guy, and it was kind of like what you're saying. I was like, I don't know what's hard about this. Yeah. I was that was what I was saying and then so yeah we did come up with a checklist for him. It wasn't a happy ending. still didn't do it and actually we switched him in the clinic. He was supposed to be my guy to check my reports. Make sure that I had the prescriptions right, that the amorizer ordered and he was missing it and I'm like you had one job anyway. And so what we did is we switched him to a customer service role. So now he answers the phone, you know makes nice nice with my cuz my patients takes the message and now it's like ah this is like and we actually put someone different in the role that we know is more meticulous and so now they like she it's a she checks all the things that the reports need to have and then it's good. We haven't had a problem in like a month so but yeah I asked her literally it was like you you can't like you didn't even try with this dude like make something happen. And yeah, so I tried, I did try, but it wasn't a happy ending that time, but I could probably do better things like a yes, no list. I just tried to give them a task list.
00:58:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So good to great. That would be a good book. So that's talked about, it uses in terms of org charts, right butts in the right seat. So let's say you're driving a bus and there's a designated seat for each function in the business, you might have all the right people on the bus, but some of them are in the wrong seats. They're in the wrong roles. Like instead of a manager, he should have been customer service. Sometimes you just got the wrong people all together and they don't belong there at all. And that generally, culture thing could be company culture, values, things like that. So you innately, or with Esther's help, I'm not sure, figured it out and well, the manager, the manager, my manager actually was.
00:59:00 - Michael’s iPhone
like, hey, how will we try this instead of just firing him? And I was like, oh, yeah, because he met all the other boxes.
00:59:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's loyal.
00:59:06 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, mean, him, I was in a month, right. Loyal, very friendly. And he met all the other boxes, he just wasn't doing this thing right.
00:59:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, a lot of things right.
00:59:20 - Michael’s iPhone
Awesome. I value loyalty lot.
00:59:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
yeah. And you should, and because you can't train loyalty. So, the other thing, and I know we're at time, but these are some of the things to look at. These are also levers, right? You can't, you can't train loyalty. You can't train integrity. You can train communication skills, but it's usually not worth it because it takes so long, because those are in-grain habits you're talking about a runway of years, which, you know, unless it's nepotism and you're trying to invest in a family member, for the most part, that's just not the best business choice to make. But you can train. skill level, you know, things like that. So if you've got somebody that's got all of the good things that you can't train, all the loyalty, all the integrity, they show up on time, they've got a great attitude and they're intelligent and they're trainable buying a place for that person, because you know what I mean? So yeah, okay, so you're gonna send me the meal macros for dinner and just add it to the reports and then we're gonna make a correlation with that and how you're sleeping. Sleeping seems to be improving. It could be Esther's letting you sleep in, it could be other things. So you're moving more, you're doing more, you just do more frequently and not only that, well, you weren't, but just knowing that you get to does something, it gives you something to look forward to. You know that there's an outlet that's coming, that does something instrumentally. Yeah. Yeah, I like to say it's borrowing energy from the future. When you worry, you borrow pain from the past. When you look forward to something you borrow energy from the future That's all I feel about it So anyway, we've got and and this is the energy You're already probably borrowing energy from the future knowing the cleaner and the babysitter and all of that stuff is coming You better send mark a picture Yes Help me pick it so he's Talking to Tina about the cars because he's like mark whatever Another car person he is though, and that's important and that matters what brings you joy brings you joy anyway okay, so Is there anything I mean again?
01:01:47 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh my last homework that I want to put down, but so I just wanted to make sure I I step my expectations, but I'm gonna talk to Esther about this is we're gonna make a list for the cleaners and my other and then the macros
01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Email to you. I do want to put in our notes that I want to finish the business spreadsheet.
01:02:05 - Michael’s iPhone
You gave me like a month to do it, but I actually want to finish it this next week. So I want to finish the business spreadsheet and that's what I'll work on this week.
01:02:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. And did you choose a time tracker?
01:02:20 - Michael’s iPhone
I haven't got that. I think I downloaded the toggle. Do you want me to work on that this week? Yeah, I do. I guess I'm fixed. I don't know. Yeah, I'm not really starting. I am starting on Wednesday like my work again. So I could do it.
01:02:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yeah, that's what I'm trying to think about. Maybe maybe we start that in September and then we can just. Okay. What I want you to think about it, but really we want. You're just in this transition period and it's kind of invalid data. The whole point of it is. real data and we don't have a flow yet and the flow is going to drastically change probably in September. I don't know, maybe not. So that's what I need you to think about is how much it'll change or not, knowing that you're in a season of change that is going to continue to change. So take that into account and then you tell me when you think it's a time to go ahead and track it knowing that it is changing. Again, we're looking for anomaly, not necessarily anomalies but patterns and corollary data so that we have a type of assessment to be able to make and just have something to pick on for optimization because there's infinite things that we could pick on to work on and they make a difference but we want to pick the most leverage thing that's going to move the needle fastest and that starts with getting some data as a baseline first. So okay so I'm going to send you this stuff in Probably about 10, 15 minutes and then we'll work on it. But if any questions, thoughts, whatever come up through the week, you can always shoot me a message.
01:04:10 - Michael’s iPhone
Sounds great. Sorry to go over, but thank you for your time.
01:04:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Totally fine. It's less about the specificity at the time and more about accomplishing what we're here for, so.
01:04:19 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah.
01:04:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
have a wonderful meeting.
01:04:22 - Michael’s iPhone
Thank you for shifting. After this, we'll go back to the 10 AM if that's okay. Oh, yeah. It's just that weird moment. Yeah, and it should already be on the calendar, right?
01:04:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, that's correct. All right. I'll see you next week.

painting so it's got my gosh you're so cute yeah yeah I just I even have a picture of me in the car we I painted an old Honda Civic in my parents garage right pink bold pink with oil based house paint and a paintbrush and put a big red vinyl sticker I got made on the sides saying pinky student painting I decided to pull pink to cover the first objection in a blue color town I was raised in of well can a woman really climb a ladder and paint the exterior of my home so I figured just go with that objection and shout to the world that yeah we are women pinky and we're pink I love that yeah yeah so I obviously saw a lot to continue but I was also realizing because you like frameworks and stuff I have a really good framework graphic that I did a while that I think you're gonna love figure out how to just model after that too and some of the stuff we're doing but basically When I sold my social media certification program, I kind of channeled some of the stuff I learned from all the business process of re-engineering and SAP consulting jobs that I did with computer sciences, all that stuff. So basically we made like a really good, say me, but Tommy got half of my ex-husband because he's, he was a consultant too, but we made this really good, what's that?
00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was the voxer thing I just got was from you, I don't know why I just sent it again.
00:01:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anyway, sorry. Oh, no, we're zeroes. So, social media, social certification methodology.
00:01:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just remembered that I made that graphic when I was like, up late.
00:01:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know it was really good, yeah, So, let me just share screen, I'm still looking for, I called it fast-track for social media, media, sort of methodology, and I, all the people that paid $2,000. to the course I got certified, I allowed them to use all of that and the white peppers I created and stuff. So I was realizing that like I gave a lot of good back then that I don't feel I'm elevating this time around that I definitely should. So that's what's good about doing this. Fast track. Let's see if this comes up. copy of Fast Track methodology. Do you see this? My social sales accelerator methodology is this?
00:02:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh it's beautiful.
00:02:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so it was blues. I actually looked like I did for maybe my social sales thing because I just modified it. But the original one is through a loop. So let me see if that comes up. If not, it's in my other Gmail account because I had an old Gmail account that I was using. Oh, that's actually really social.
00:02:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the yellow and gray is the other combination that works really well and you can think of of Amazon. Amazon uses those colors. are some like, yes, yeah, yeah, gray brown, you know, UPS, brown, brown gold, but gold and blue and often they're used together, but those are powerful colors and the gray and black are kind of elite level, right? Which is why Amazon, I mean, in the beginning, um, and even so, they, they've got so much to them, Brown, but UPS, corporate, corporate kind of thing.
00:03:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So here it is. Like, this is the whole webinar presentation at the end of a challenge. I like someone coaching room and, you know, um, that was a review.
00:03:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
love to do a webinar together.
00:03:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We have to get some offers and this is what we're working towards.
00:03:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. I was thinking about it last night and I was, you know, in my prayers and stuff and after, especially after you were consulting and I'm not consulting. I'm asking about the scaling question, I'm just talking to Heavenly Father and I'm like, know, because here's the thing, Maria, like, I'm not trying to build a legacy business, I never have my love is always like, can you protect your brand? got to this? I'm like, babe, this is not my calling forever. This is what I'm doing now, like, I'm, I'm running a book called the prosperity complex. And it talks about, and it's very much the same premise as give a man a fish versus feed a man. feed a manifesting, teach him how to fish, that kind of thing. But it's that you don't solve poverty by giving money. You don't solve poverty by redirecting money or donating or things like that. solve poverty by making self-provident people. And when my babies are grown, all I want to do is go visit my family and my friends, my loves. And I want to strengthen them and I want to teach them skills. I would love to go to Africa. I'd love to go to that any country even do it here, but teach people the same way that I serve my clients just every day people that would never have a chance to learn it because there are so many skills. We figured out lemonade stands where we're kids, know, and mowing lawns like kids can do it. So there are grown people who could completely change their communities if they have somebody just say, number one, you can do it. Here's how you can do it and here's the simplest way to do it because most people don't teach that part, right? that's what I want. So in the meantime, what I'm doing now, I just want to serve God through my people, through my kids, my business, by helping them do that right be self-provident. The money that I need to help people because I have to teach how to fish, but also feed fish until they can
00:06:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
learn, right?
00:06:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so I've got that responsibility and the income that I need and want to generate. But I want to have joy in it and I want to bring joy in. I was just thinking in terms of that scalable, I still think that us spending our time with a few high level clients, and this is the diversification that I've been saying about from the beginning, right? that you don't have just one offer, you have a few offers, you have one that's like really high level that pays well but also gives you the experience of keeping your soft, super sharp and really understanding the businesses inside and out. also because it's a high level client, having higher level expansive mind expanding conversations, right? And then you take it back to the lower levels and just showing up in a community. and me teaching people, nurturing them, loving them and helping them make money. I'm like, that's so like joy for a few years while I finished raising my baby and we making plans with whatever extra money we're doing because one of the things I wanted to do is have my money work for me. And like I imagine the compounding effect of us working together for a few years if you were interested in it and building an off ramp where you do whatever you wanted to do because you've got the money that you do whatever you want to do you can do it because of purpose or and likewise and not that I would just like disappear because when I keep people I keep people forever so there's that but anyway I just thought how much joy would it be to just share community and serve them and love them and teach them the marketing and the business and but also to feed off of their thoughts it's not like we're there are going to be people that are smarter than us in some ways you know sorry did you say something?
00:08:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I had to say Alexa stop. had an alarm for an hour, but I already did it. It was to put the rice back in the fridge. Sometimes I pre-cook rice for dinner.
00:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've gotten lazy and I buy the ones you can just steam in 90 seconds.
00:08:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I have those too. I have lots of those too, but I got a rice cooker.
00:08:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's kind of cool, so yeah. Oh, last night I threw a bunch in the Instant Pot, so it was brown rice chicken, broccoli, with some cream of chicken, and there's some Montreal chicken seasoning, and then some cheese in it.
00:08:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Nice. Montreal chicken season.
00:08:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
at you, Canadian, It's good.
00:08:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That sounds fantastic, actually. I normally would make that with the leftover turkey, but we also have mashed potatoes and stuffing left, so we're just having a repeat tonight. But the kiddos are gone. Amanda's on Thomas. He's doing his master's in speech pathology, and yeah, and he His girlfriend, he just started dating about eight months ago, so this is like the third week and they've come down now So it's kind of really fun having them here So we had a dinner with them on Sunday Just us and then to my family my mom and my brother and sister all and her brother stuff We had a big family and yesterday at their house It was not a good and it was funny because me and a man were talking about our eyes are always so much bigger than everything Because we went to the liquor store thinking oh we're gonna have all this booze for everyone and stuff But all this wine really nice bottles of wine like god will be ever heard of decoy that red. I don't drink Well, this is what's funny cuz we don't drink much either This is why it's funny cuz I don't we're getting all this cuz we get booze for everyone and they're young and stuff and Literally we each had like one glass Saturday night and one glass of wine on Sunday one glass of wine lat yesterday So so we laughed at each other saying well, we got booze that'll last us till well into the new year because I my sister and I were talking about it cuz she drank too much
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the weekend and I was like, when I was 18, I got blackout drunk a couple of times and the fact that I could drink so much, probably also had some marijuana, but drink so much that I first of all, I thought my body was explode and I peed all over myself.
00:10:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So there was that.
00:10:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I didn't remember what I did and when I was told what I did and the way that I behaved was just rude. And I was like, I need to not, and I'm not, I don't do anything by halves. So if I'm on drink, I'm on. So religion or not, I just need to not be a drinker.
00:10:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, it's funny. Um, yeah. So, so it was, yeah, it was really good. So, so yeah. So, but when I, right, I almost like was going to vox you the few hours later saying, Oh, wait, no, disregard the message about these offers and scaling because I realized the first step is you need the pedigree and all my courses use that and then we'll figure out from there. so anyways, that's why. I backed off unboxing you because I'm like, oh, I got to get this done for you.
00:11:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For us. Yeah. Because I really, what I think it's just going to do is make attracting people and make our marketing so much easier.
00:11:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:11:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's not just what you've accomplished, but it's your path of evolution. And so you're not just showing somebody that, look, this is where I am. And this is the success I have now. Like, I got here in steps because everybody has to get where they're going in steps. You don't leapfrog for the most part. So the other thing is I specifically for you is I think that you had forgotten how great you were. Like you knew it, but the details of it every time you would tell the story, you'd be like, I forgot that. And I had paid attention to the fact that you kept saying you forgot that. And so I wanted you to really remember, but also because you've attracted these people and they start to got a connection with you and low ticket and in their mind, maybe lower value, that needs to be corrected. The second part of it was what's your library of content, like what have you created because from that, and you have way more than me to bring to the table, as far as I'm concerned. Way more experience, in terms of volume, the thing that I think that I do the best is that mine has always been leveraged. My effective hourly rate has stayed high for a long time. I've worked very, very little and still done really, really well, but in terms of volume of clients, because I work so little, I don't have a vast experience and I didn't make as much money myself. So I have earned over a million dollars over a few years of coaching, which is you. But I'm less impressive, between your library and your pedigree, that will help convert people a lot. I'm more impressive when you talk to me, more impressive than you. mean, more impressive as a person, but I don't really feel like mine. There are some accomplishments that people go, wow, I think, but I think I just have less of them.
00:13:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, and the thing is what you'll find about all my stuff, you look at it all, that probably if I stuck to one of those, I would be in a far different position right now. Because I totally realized that, look at Amy Portafield, like she had, I remember when she first, like I used to be a search term on Google, like people, like I'm sorry on Facebook ads, you know, interest. So back in the day. So, so, and that was before Amy Portafield even existed. And then she came out with her podcast and all this stuff. And then she, but she stuck with it. Like, yeah, she had webinars that convert. That was her. first thing, but then she converted to Digital Course Academy, and she stuck with it. Like all this time, or look at Brooke Castillo, the life coach school, like she stuck with it. Yeah, she's going through whatever changes she's going through right now, but she like, so I think that was my biggest downfall because probably if I stuck with just the social media certification, because that social media is still hot now, then it was like years ago, but this whole webinar, after the challenge selling this, because you know, they even got a certificate.
00:14:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This was back in 2000.
00:14:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Wow. Yeah, this back in 2011 for social media was huge. So I could have been like the, what's that other gal? The blonde here that wears the turquoise blue all the time.
00:14:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mary, Mary, she's glazer.
00:14:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I like her too. No, she's the Facebook queen, Facebook loves her, and got her to speak a lot on the Facebook stages. Mary, I forget. Anyway, so I'll come to my mind, but But this whole thing took a hell of a lot of work to create.
00:15:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How do I have stesses, lot of testimonials.
00:15:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I think it was probably just because with divorcing Rudy and everything since I felt he helped me create behind the scenes this. Maybe, so he was sort of like that Tony Robbins on my shoulder and a really motivational. Yeah, maybe I just felt. now. Yeah, yeah, so maybe with that I just felt I didn't really want. Well, so something I'm a shiny object. want new technology. Everyone's doing social media now. So let me do something different, but like this, you know, this is all really good graphics and stuff.
00:15:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
know we can update it to 2000, you know, 24 terms, but still this was like really damn good. So think about though is that because I've beaten myself up for the jumping around and things that I do, but I'm a generalist. I'm not a specialist. I do have specialized skills and to me, that is leverage and it is simplicity. But it's even those are general type terms, right? They can be applied universally with benefit. But the value that you have in having all of that experience is that the nuance of your knowledge and understanding, one of the greatest assets I have brought to companies that I manage their operations and the way that one of the reasons I was able to get them to grow so well wasn't just my structure. It was my liaising between the different departments because I knew them because I'd done their jobs. I've done copy, I've done graphics, I've done development, not to the same level, but I knew enough to know your program lying to you about how hard this is or how long this takes or how much it costs. fire him. them or fire me because I'm not going to keep putting up with this attitude and him holding everybody else back and things got fixed. But because I understood every aspect of the business, top to bottom, left to right, diagonally, my ability to manage it really well, that's where it came from because I done the jobs. So you understand like multi-channel marketing in a whole new kind of way. You understand the ins and outs of the channels. You know how to leverage a single channel, but you know so many things. Now at this season in life, it may behoove you to stay more focused in a particular realm. the realm can be a realm of slightly ambiguous generality so that still explore nuance. So, for example, with business systems, teams operations, these are the things I talk about. I get to play with technology because systems and technology go hand in hand.
00:18:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, that's a whole lot of shiny that I get to play with.
00:18:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And yeah, I mean, that's the biggest thing, technology in terms of project management in terms of automations for customer in terms knowledge and connection and even customer nurturing with the automation, right? So not just acquiring, but nurturing and extracting everything you can out of each customer and increasing the lifetime value, but making that reciprocal and creating the nurturing that gives everything you can back into the customer. That's a lot of shiny for me. That's fun because there's so many different, you know, like AI, all. these different things. But also the psychology of how to do that. So I get to study marketing psychology and I get to study leadership, which is more shiny to me because I love like Adam Grant and I love Robert Chaldini. And those are shiny for me because there's a new thing and I'm like, ooh, what happens if I apply here? But it's still like I've been doing systems. Everybody knows me as a systems person, which has kind of been detrimental to me because I'm way more than that, but that's where put their heads around.
00:19:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
your copy, your marketing, adult productivity as well.
00:19:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, everything. Yeah, mindset. Yeah. So anyway, I do also have to leave at like 1145 because my daughter is home and she needs me to take her to school.
00:19:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I've got a hard stop in 20 minutes. And I'm really sad because I don't want to talk about all these things. That's okay. Hey, we'll have tomorrow, too. Well, let me update you couple of things. I haven't said anything to Joe, but I can. I can just kind of respond and say, look, Joe, oh, yeah, we've been, sorry, we've also been swamped with other people that want to hire our services for kind of what we have. So we're going to, we don't have a bandwidth right now to help you, but just, you know, and just leave it like that, you know, nice.
00:20:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you can say whatever. I still think that like it's not even necessary, that you do have other people interested in talking to you, but just the, the message I said might be too blunt for you. I don't know if you remember it on boxers.
00:20:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
was long. I thought it was quite long. That's the only thing I thought.
00:20:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's totally possible to you.
00:20:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But it's so funny. It's totally possible. Let's see. Let's see. Boxer. I thought it left an opening for her to actually still hire us.
00:21:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, yes, she wanted to do the pocket CMOC.
00:21:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, but I know she won't. No, she won't because she's asked us a lot more of free.
00:21:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Exactly.

00:21:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Uh, just Joe.
00:21:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi, Joe, maybe there it is for Joe.
00:21:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
At least that. Not think about it or apply. might send him this. We have to have all that we said that you want to call your man. I just mentioned we have managed on this one to test where you get it with this offer. Yeah, that's why I thought no, because I think she's still going to be unhappy. Don't you think, if she buys the CMO, pocket CMO, COO, don't you think she's going to be there?
00:22:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
won't buy it.
00:22:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, so just leave it like this then, because you know she's not going to buy it? because she won't buy it, because you still gave her the window, but she's not going to buy it. Okay, okay. Okay. Go through all your . for a of I know I laughed little bit when she said, well, plus the percentages, that's $250,000. thinking, it's $250,000 and nothing, because it doesn't have it's too risky whether we'll get it.
00:22:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was one of the other causes of mine in Rudy's divorce. the other part of this being long is it's tedious, guess what she's been, tedious.
00:22:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes. All right. Oh. So it's from you, the software that Marie and I put out. So did you want to respond to her with this?
00:23:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
can do that.
00:23:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I can be the .
00:23:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:23:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. you do that, yeah, because I've got good news. I got three strong candidates in the pipeline for, yeah. So remember that one guy that we drafted the scope for Grant Mueller? He did pay $1,000. He actually said send me the pay public. So then he said, I'm looking to start this Friday. I know it's your Canadian Thanksgiving. So I said, OK, well, let's all get together with all to send you some information after Thanksgiving. And so by Friday, he gives me access to his account. Is that then I'll send him the other invoice for $4,000? So that's $5,000 a month. So that's good. And then you know who came out of the blue. And again, there's a lot of lurkers, I guess, in the NHB board stuff was I don't know you know. But he's a pretty big player in the manifestation niche. Um, oh my god. He does affirmations Let me go to Facebook get you know us Noah St.
00:24:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is that it that's when you said Noah that was the name of pop to my head that I don't know him I just know the name.
00:24:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah Ditto I think ages ago one of my colleagues did some work for him before he was famous And I know I think I may have consulted him like I'm talking 15 years ago Off for an hour about social media strategy, but that was way back in the day So he so I don't think he knows Recognize that was me because I think it was through a colleague, but um, yeah, that was when he was nothing now look at him So yeah, so he's interested So I'm gonna talk to him tomorrow afternoon. We arrange a call for tomorrow afternoon So nothing's determined yet or anything and then there's another guy that wants to do He also is from NHB Allen's group. He used to have a yoga, the modern yoga.com brand. He sold it off, so it sailed and go that well because the urnout that I was supposed to be paid by the new owners never really came. And that's typical. That's happened to me too when I sold one, something before. And so he said, but he did with that company, he helped yoga instructors establish courses online and sell stuff online and basically do webinar funnels. He said, so I have funnels that really work and I'd really like to get into recurring revenue of Go High Level. So he wants to create a low ticket product that can then put people into Go High Level. Basically giving away that $10,000 course that he used to have. Basically it was given away. So I've been talking him back and forth and I said, I'm simply giving away. You should just create a little take a funnel with that, right? then it blah blah blah. So anyway, he actually is pretty serious as well, but he's in Thailand right now on vacation or something. So we're going to chat tomorrow morning briefly and see if there's any legs. for him, I did tell him $20,000. So yeah.
00:26:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:26:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So we'll have to figure this all out if this all comes fruition because remember, we haven't got an agreement yet, but there are certain aspects where I think initially, I don't mind getting the money coming into me for cash flow of the one client, Brett Mueller. But for the others, if we want to take them, I'd rather see maybe the money going to you in the US, because in Canada, well, they're not Canadian, so it's not an issue. If a Canadian pays me, it's paying me because you got to pay HST because I have an HST license, which is harmonized sales tax, then you got to charge them GST. like GST is like 13%. So if they buy 20,000 from you, you have to add an extra 30% tax or else the government's going to come to me for it. So it's way better for you also taking the money into your US entity and all that jazz.
00:26:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I do not know enough about anything in structure, but so how Um, do you get, um, like, is there a different type of payment? So, so like we have employment, self employment tax, and then we have personal tax. So like if the company gets paid a certain amount, that's one thing. And if I as a person get paid a certain amount, that's a different thing, they're taxed differently. So like, how would that work for you? is it just that, um, I would take it and then pay you, and just because you're getting reduced amount, you're not having to pay that initial 13%. So it stays the tax.
00:27:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
how does that work? No, well, well, first of all, like I was mentioning this so that you get money as well. Like this is part of the joint venture because you're helping, you know, with those other clients, like if that's why I would say that, um, those, these warm clients, it doesn't really matter if they're not living in Canada.
00:27:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't charge only if they're in Canada.
00:27:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Do you have to charge 30% like as long as they're anywhere else in the world, it's not an issue. So that's why like 99% of my clients are outside of Canada. I really don't like having Canadian clients don't really, they take too long to make a decision. First of all, they're very conservative, add the Canadian dollar, I want to get paid in the U.S.
00:28:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like what I did with Creed is like I would just invoice her, you make money and then whatever the amount, I'll just invoice her.
00:28:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And so I'm like a consultant to you that you're, you're paying, but it's sort of, I'm just thinking down the road because I don't, you know, let's just say if like 20k comes in in the next like 30 days, I want you to have some of that. So that's kind of where that's coming from too.
00:28:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're good to team.
00:28:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That are going to get emotional. Yeah.
00:28:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like you making everybody else money, but like it's good to be able to take care of my people too, you know? Yeah. I, it would be great. And I got to tell you like the gratitude that you do marketing because that's the thing. I don't, I don't whatever. We've had these conversations before. It's just not, I'm ambivert and I really withdraw a lot. Now, to serve is a whole different thing, the marketing aspect of it just drains me. I love the service and I love the work and showing up and getting to do that. And if we could bring in a few high level clients that we could serve really well together. And then if we could siphon off enough time to work on a smaller offer that's scalable, I really think it would be joyful to serve a community together and just to teach people and to love them and to serve them. I think that we'd feel blessed. think we're much as given much as required, know, and God has blessed us with really strong personalities and minds and hearts. And I just know that the world needs it and all the good people. that are out there, there's not enough of them serving. So anyway, I just, I feel happy borrowing joy from the future in the hope knowing that we're building this and just getting to talk to you every day to makes me happy.
00:30:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm really good.
00:30:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm borrowed joy from the future. So to me, when you worry, you borrow pain from the past.
00:30:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But when you hope you borrow joy from the future. Wow. When you worry, you borrow pain from the past.
00:30:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. Yeah. I heard a phrase once that is don't go borrowing troubles. I think it's a, you know, a black thing that I heard. But then I realized that one of my powers has always been even as a kid is, I live in the present, but I always borrow energy from the future that I'm creating. I live in that moment, as though it's the reality. you know, as I got older, it's the kind of a law of attraction, you know, things like, like, it's already happened. And that was never a concept to me, but if actually it had, because I felt it. And I felt the reality of it strongly enough that it brought me joy and energy. So that's what I think about. Like, I can literally borrow energy from a future that doesn't even exist right now of all the infinite possibilities with hope. And it makes me happy in the now.
00:31:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love it.
00:31:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get to talk to you.
00:31:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
just, every time I'm saying my present, it's just so hey, what trellible. board are you thinking of that that would be part of the scope? said, we'll make them a trellibor so they're responsible for their own data, which I love because as an agency with Emily Hirsch, like we'd always provide them Friday stats, but very few clients I've read it, they'd have no clue still and then you know what I mean? Like I loved your whole thought process of they know what the heck we're doing so they get the value of what they've invested in.
00:32:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yay, let me see if I can find the template that I used to use for base camp because we can start with that. Course creator template bundle? is that? Oh no, that's campa. But I could even create one from scratch because I've done it so many times. I feel like I found it and showed it to you and drive. was a, I think I probably have a few of them, but we, it would be fresh because I don't have anything in Trello. But basically, So, you know, and we can do most of this in our sleep probably, and as we've had conversations and talking about implementation, I rattle off this step, this step, this step, this step, that's what we've done. So basically what you do is you, we could put multiple boards in Trello. So let's say you're launching a new digital offer. And so in there, you would have a copy section and a graphic section and a development section, and then a marketing section, because these are all the pieces that go together. So the first thing that has to happen is the offer has to be created, and then market research has to be done before you can give it to a copywriter or the copywriter is doing it.
00:33:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's an assignment.
00:33:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So, and then you define does that offer match, right? market research and offer creation. kind of it's kind of a circle like chicken and egg kind of thing one can happen before the other but then you need to go reiterate based based on what you find. So then it goes to copy and then the graphic designer really needs the copy before he can put you know graphics together because there's the verbiage that goes on to the e-books or the ad graphics or whatever. The developer needs the copy and the graphic to landing page, opt-in, So then you've got the developmental operations on that side but then you also add the copy if there's a you know abandoned cart sequence. there's a nurturing sequence after they opt in to send them to a sale where they purchase the sale and then there's a you know follow up or they're upset like all of these things have to be mapped out so all of that could be put into a project management suite and so not only do they wrap their whole heads around it but they could literally just change the title slightly assign a person put a due date and one of the things we can do and talk about is like you know you should expect about this much time for this process to happen if you're doing it well and if you've hired it well you can get this accomplished for roughly this amount of time and money and then we could also pair that up with the PTE maximizer right profit time energy maximizer and go like look make your decisions based off of what you already know here if you're going to hire somebody you know we one of the things we did was your effective hourly rate so who are we hiring or are you doing it Are you writing the copy? you doing the development? Are you putting your name in there? That may be the case because sometimes we've got more time than we have money. Even if we have almost no time, you might be dear money. Anyway, so no matter who we're serving, even when I go on to people who have made millions of dollars, most of them don't have project management suites and they don't have that. So people, so your lurkers, if we do some screenshots of some of this stuff, and it doesn't matter if people steal it, so what? There's enough for us, we don't need everybody to buy from us. We just need enough people to buy from us. We'll make sure that happens if we're out there surfing, so we don't need to worry about who steals and he tries to whatever. You can't take with mine. He won't let you, so whatever. Yeah, so as people, and there will be lurkers who will sometimes, especially if we don't have a high ticket cost where they can come in and check out everything, they'll go on to be like. like Dan does that all the time, Dan Ryan, he goes and buys people stuff and then he goes and hires them for a very long time and gives them a lot of money because he's like, yeah, all your stuff.
00:37:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You're super smart. How do I get you?
00:37:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, I think that that could be a massive value, especially if on top of that they get access to being able to show up on our weekly calls or ask questions in a group or whatever. And then they start to the questions inspire more questions and more answers. So one person asked the questions that somebody else didn't even know to think and ask about. And then they're all like, oh, and I'm like, well, yeah, I didn't think about teaching you about that. But I could teach you about that. you know, like it all just feeds and builds upon itself. And it could be very lucrative, very quickly, because you don't find a pair like you and me just in there.
00:37:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, I agree. So but this is specific for like say Grant, right? Like he's probably We're going to want to see some thing happening in Trello.
00:38:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if you put it up, we would just have one of our conversations, you and me, or even them. And I've just set it up and build it, build it, manage it, run it, do like just do operations, plus support you in marketing, basically, whatever is needed to show up, because the faster we do it, and I, there's also the saying many hands make light work. Like, it'll just be easier.
00:38:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. And what's cool is that he's probably out of the three. He's the best guy to start with, because he's already got a low ticket funnel started. He just doesn't have a good order bump. He doesn't have enough cell one, doesn't have enough cell two. So he really just needs the refinement versus the other two will be starting something from scratch and a little bit harder to get momentum. But yeah, this would be good.
00:38:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if you sell anybody and we work together and I get paid, here's what you should know about me.
00:38:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Everybody's business like it's own.
00:39:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to come in and nurture the crap out of it and offer it to serve. also mindful of not stepping on toes. don't need to be the star of the show. I don't need to be ego. Like, we had the conversation with Joe. Like, I talked, I'll lead, but I'm not trying, but I don't need to dominate. I don't need it. You know what I mean? And it's important to know that because sometimes you work with people and you're like, they just, you know, like they got it to go and they want to make it about them.
00:39:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't care. I care about you.
00:39:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I care about how you feel at the end of everything more than I'll care about them.
00:39:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. And I'm kind of the same. you know, I've probably give too much to their company, right? yeah. so, I hope I had to be ego more 12 years ago, but I think my ego sort of more humbled out. I was a jerk.
00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was.
00:40:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Okay. So, uh, yeah. So let's just play by your about the other ones. Um, the other two, but I think Grant's in if he made the pause unless he chickens out, we'll see. And then we'll go from there.
00:40:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know you got to go soon. I do. I wanted to. I was so excited. I'm a nerd about like I'm a five year old about this graphic that I made.
00:40:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes.
00:40:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I made it. I'm like, it kind of actually reminds me of one of my client's images. I'm like, did I mentally steal something that we've used before?
00:40:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, because it's, no, because it's, it's very similar to the Emily Hirsch one and I'm the intellectual property creator of that.
00:40:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, I'm excited. can exist still for a while. As we had, oh, so the colors are blue and orange. That still exists. Am I on that page still? I'm still on there.
00:40:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, my gosh.
00:40:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What?
00:41:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Show me.
00:41:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, sure, sure.
00:41:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You'll learn.
00:41:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sure screen, sure screen. I went to LA for this photo shoot.
00:41:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, sure.
00:41:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not the right thing.
00:41:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's the website.
00:41:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
D4Ybrandbuilder.com. D4Y. Yeah, I turned that into a seven figure agency within month. And then he just destroyed it by taking our too many clients too fast.
00:41:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:41:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that's it.
00:41:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Are you in the about? No, so on the home page, there's D4Y and there's a laptop. There's Arthur and I'm to the left of him. Oh, yeah, there you go. And there's .com secrets. Why did he show .com secrets just for the branding?
00:41:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's just for what he calls them. Arthur is something else. Oh, brand recognition. see that. like, yeah, he didn't work with them or anything, but he follows that stuff. Competitive analysis, value letter design, strategic evolution, community build-outs, social media management, email marketing, and I ran everything in that company.
00:42:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, well.
00:42:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Services, let's see what they have for clients. Oh, nature select. I forgot about that. Our rows forgot about them too. Gymnast, whatever. Anyway, we had, we had a graphic and it was kind of like the value letter design. And I feel like after I saw this, I'm like, it seems similar to some D for Y stuff, but I don't remember. Anyway, but Yeah, but it was inspired with the Emily, her stuff, but also for sure.
00:43:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've created other graphics and had graphics.
00:43:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where's the Canva thing? But, um, what, what I actually liked and what I kept like reiterating is the right thing. Nope, that's not the right thing. Canva design. I'll just go home. Oh my gosh. I just made my thing go away. My daughter don't reply to me.
00:43:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
She's probably like passed out.
00:43:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It takes lunch anyway at school. She doesn't have to be there right now. But what I kept working on is, and it seems like it wouldn't be that much because there's not actually that much here. But this, whatever we put into here. This is what I think is unique is replicating the will determine maintainable cost and pace of scaling.
00:43:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't think people really think about that much and I don't think.
00:44:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if I in implementing complimentary or supplementary offers based on customer feedback, and so that's all the more looking at data, but, but I think that so like this could be a whole kind of PDF and then the next one like break down day zero through 90 and much more detail and 90 through 80 and much more detail, like each of the faces in more detail. So people go like, that's a lot to be giving to me to walk me through to help me do. Um, like I think that we can make amazing webinar slides out of this. Yeah, agree. Easy on the eyes. think it looks professional. I was kind of proud of this.
00:44:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think it looks amazing. Can you share that with me? Yeah. Yeah.
00:44:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't share the link.
00:44:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You, you know, it says only you could. Yeah. I think I was going to say. You probably thought of Oh, is this like the done for you brand builder only because it's the blue and the Orange gold. Yeah, I think that's the only similarities So and if you're unsure about that we could change growth Nope, I'm not changing nothing. I've built most that anyway. Yeah, got it Yeah, no, love all this because also this can just be repeatable to sell to other people who want to start an Agency and then that's how we could make recurring revenue. think from go high level because then we can Give them a snapshot of the website that includes the methodology things. Maybe we create some white papers for them Share some case studies they could use It's taking what I did for social media certification, but doing it for like Agencies or entrepreneurs or something.
00:45:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yes So the snapshots can match up with the projects all set in a way in the in the template Mm-hmm Yeah, anyway, and I do think I think that so the thing that I was thinking is that the visual representation, and I think I sent that in the message, but you know, I'll go do a quick search marketing campaign, low chart, there's tons of these.
00:46:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
How come your computer just got really small mobile sized.
00:46:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Yeah, there. So, like, we could make versions of this with our colors and branding. Oh, yeah. But we can make variations of this. what it would look like to launch a main product or relaunch or add an order bump into the mix or upsell or whatever or turn it into a recurring revenue. you had a one off at all, you had this high ticket, like, yeah, how you, you know, so anyway.
00:46:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, no, I get it, Ravi Abubala was good at that using Lucidchart. He, I think, sold a lot of his initial class. Science because he showed a damn good flow chart of stuff. Um, yeah, I have an account for them but I never really used it a lot.
00:47:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I never use it, but I have it and I'm like, you know what? Ryan?
00:47:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Did you buy it way back in the days when it was like, yeah, me too.
00:47:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:47:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. I think that produces great flow charts.
00:47:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Some people use Miro now too, M-I-R Mind. Yeah. Mindjet. Um, what's another one? Yeah, there's one to the man. There's flowy something like that.
00:47:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's right. Yeah.
00:47:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
then the Giffy even G-I-O. Giffy. Giffy. That's the one that Dan has built our org charts with. Yeah. yeah, org charts, like some super basic org charts, like two team org charts and like really show what they're doing. Yeah. How it evolves into three, five, 10, 20 and how You know, you can have a multi seven figure business with a five person team and it's not that difficult. If you do it, right?
00:48:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You can have a multi what business seven figure seven figure. They're right down to maybe that's our slogan Multi seven figure business no one says that Yeah, well, that's my ears perked up because everyone's like here's how to have a six figure business six figure six months I know sounds people like it.

Let's build a simple funnel with what we have and that's where our previous trainings will come in and then maybe we just do some live webinar trainings and build content out of that. Something to think about but anyway. So tomorrow let's just pick it up from where we're at right now and then put the intention out that within the next couple weeks try to create agendas for each of our

Hi, how are you?
00:00:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Good, good. So what's going on with you? happened this morning?
00:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have to get my hormone levels checked because I get estrogen and progesterone. And also I need keep an eye on my A1c, which is, I have diabetes. I don't have it, but I don't want to get it and just keep an eye on it. But I normally have really tiny veins that are not very good to draw. But I've been taking Clariton because my allergies have been super bad, like my whole face hurts here all the time. all the time. Anyway, and on top of that, I'm about to start my period. So I'm extra emotional and extra sensitive. And she put the tourniquet extra tight so she could find it dug in this arm didn't get it.
00:01:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's the tourniquet on this one.
00:01:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's bruised from the tourniquet.
00:01:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then she told me she would not dig in this hand, but she did.
00:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Finally got the blood three cubes, but the whole thing just hurt. don't normally cry from the pain, but like it was a lot today.
00:01:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:01:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mostly, I think probably because of hormones, but, and I was going in feeling like I was about to have a hot flash. Haven't eaten because you can't it was a fasting lab. Anyway, so this morning is emotional and I'm just ready to get on with my day. Yes, last night, I was using I hate. This is my executive dysfunction. writing anything about myself. If it's for a specific purpose of teaching somebody and tell my story because this story pertains to what you are doing and it's actually about you being my training of my experience then I'm you know I don't think about it but so what I did was I went to chat GPT with the stories I'm like I don't even know what stories it has because I've given it so much stuff and so it wrote a lot of things for me for my history and then I went in found my trainings sorry let's see for things that I had created let me shut my screen assignment that that we had I think that it needs the next iteration, but for me, I can't even explain how much I hate this type of stuff and how hard it is for me to do, especially when I'm not feeling great emotionally. Yeah. But I did because I want to make traction. So, I have base camp training videos. Nice. I teach people, I taught people, this was 12 years ago when I first created about boomerang for Gmail.
00:03:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you know what that is? Yes. Yes. attempted use it as well, but I don't use it as much, but it sounds cool.
00:03:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We don't. I mean, Gmail actually has integrated a lot of the features that Boomerang had and also taught about, yes, where I taught people how to filter their emails and use smart filters, so their inbox isn't full all the time. Let's see, reportive, and yes, where reportive is another Gmail integration that uses canned responses so that you can kind of automate, so yes, where, and reportive do a lot of the same things.
00:04:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And again, this was 12 years ago. I haven't been using them because I don't really need to because I barely work and I just have the same clients though, but that's not really scalable anyway, and not a real business.
00:04:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a job. Like I haven't dropped, let's be honest about that. Anyway, but reportive allows you to create different types of canned responses and connect with your team, so you can customize them for people and you can have those response times like Gmail lets you do a lot of things again. that it does, but it still has some other things. I had the timesheet homework, which is now the PTE Maximizer. have a video for that. I taught people how to use LastPass. I haven't gone through this, but I wonder what the webinar is. I had this program called Social Media Profits, like, because I had this partner was all about, we got to make money blah, blah, blah, this was not when he was my love, but he was just like an associate. He's very professional, like he won't associate the discord, but he always cared about me as a single mom, and he didn't want to see me be taking advantage of, and he knew things about my partner. so he would kind of try to get me to basically open my eyes, notice this thing, notice that thing and just kind of around it. and then anyway figured it out got rid of that partner and then ended up falling in love with my hero so yeah kept him nice love him anyway so um and so for i'll show you what and blah blah blah that was not good chat gpt and i got just kind of roughly which i need to assemble that's not it okay i'm going up there was a basically it took a few stories that i found and then it took some testimonials and turned it into um a story at one point it makes stories together and it put you in with my story coffee shop millionaire that was from like 13 years ago i'm like you know you're making stuff up now so um hold on a sec there's just a couple there's like one area i would show you and so my job is i'm just gonna take all of this and put it into a Google Doc and use it as kind of a framework to remind myself and modify it. Okay, so I think there was actually one more version after this that I like that one. Um, yeah, there's some things I have to modify here, but I've been an entrepreneur.
00:07:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Did you care if I read it? Like I feel like this is way my brain processes stop.
00:07:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, I've been an entrepreneur for as long as I can remember. My first taste of running a business came when I was just 10 years old, babysitting in the neighborhood, then quickly expanding my repertoire to a paper route of 11 and mowing lawns as a preteen and a team. Even back then I wasn't just doing it for pocket money. I have my sights on something bigger. This is not mine. I knew I was meant to create opportunities, not just for myself, for others, chat, dbt, liberties. Yeah. And I don't even know where this story came from. So as I got older, I naturally gravitated towards jobs that would change me to think like a leader, also totally, whatever, made that up. I found myself working in corporate America where the stakes were high level. I would say this is it. Our jobs were constantly under threat of being outsourced to places like Costa Rica or the Philippines. You had the pre-work every single day, and there was this relentless grind of reporting systems that were painfully, anyway. Okay, so bottom line is that that's where I got started. I'll rewrite this, but it was that we were in a, and I might have told you this, but in, so let's see, I worked there from 1996 to 2002. And so we had Excited Home, Apple, Intel, Adobe, Visio, all under one roof in a call center. And I, at the time was working, at the time of discovering this, I was working for Intel, and so my job was a technical team lead, but it was basically a business within a business. So I was responsible for staffing, 30 percent team, 24 hours a day, and I was responsible for hiring, coaching, terminating, so everything there, and then meeting corporate metrics. So Intel had a contract with Sykes, which was the company that I worked for, that we would answer calls within a certain amount of time, that we would resolve the calls within a certain amount of time, and at the call, the average length of the calls would be a certain amount of things. So that, those were our metrics. If we exceeded those metrics, there was a bonus, if we failed to meet those metrics, we didn't, we were penalized significantly financially, we didn't even get our contract. That would happen. And there would be this phone call from Sykes corporate office. Well, first from Intel corporate to Sykes corporate, then to my building. And then everything flowed downhill.
00:10:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And so we'd have this emergency meeting.
00:10:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Somebody's going to lose their job because we're in districts. OK, well, how come we didn't know that in the first place, and how come we weren't taking care of it, and I'm tired of getting threatened? Meanwhile, most of this stuff and most of these, even the managers were industry level workers. And all the job was on the job training. So most of the people didn't care. It was just a good paycheck.
00:10:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They didn't have the work, flipping burgers, whatever.
00:10:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. But I didn't want to be threatened. I didn't want to go flip burgers. I dropped out of college. I wanted this to work. I also really loved the technology, and I loved what I was learning. So anyway, we had a Lucid technology phone. I know those big black phones that have those buttons. on them like tons and tons of buttons on them. So those buttons had all these different modes where you could put yourself. So one was like waiting for a call, one was you're on the call, one was hold, one was transfer, one was called ACW, which is after call waiting where we would write our notes, whatever. So all of those different things had metrics, but tied to that was the technology that allowed reporting. So the phones could, there was a server that tracks how long each phone, because each phone was programmed with its own number. So how long it was in each of those modes and during which time we even used it as a time clock, that was where you logged in and logged out at the end of the day. So, you know, 1996, 2004, this technology was there, but the reporting was archaic and it didn't really exist. I can't really say archaic because it was still pretty modern at the time. But what it wasn't able to do, who spit out a report that automatically told us are we in metrics or are we not that did not exist. So after about the third time being this position as a manager and going through one of these types of meetings and being like, you know, cortisol pumping through my body, maybe in short style, like what's going to happen. Like I got to figure out how to know ahead of time where I stand so that I don't go, am I the one? Is it me? So what I found out was that where there were five reports that that the loosened phone system had that if I put them into a spreadsheet and did a few formulas, I would know exactly where we stood. So it took five of them. Now, again, I so when I started working there was 21. And when I left, yeah, hold on, 2000. Yeah, something like that. No, actually, I think it started when I was 19. So anyway, again, and this is 1996, like emails brand Like technology, most people haven't been using computers, word processing was basic, knowing Excel was not something that everybody knew. few people knew it. Google Docs didn't exist at the time. So I had a friend, he was also LDS and nerdy, he was in Excel all the time. like, can you show me this? Cause I saw what he was looking at and there were formulas and numbers, I was like, is this? And so I asked him if there was a way that he could help me do this thing that I was trying to do with these different reports to make these calculations. so he helped me put some calculations in. So I had five different tabs in one workbook. And so I would dump each of the reports into five tabs. in the mornings, I would go run the report, copy and paste it into the five, just raw data tabs. And then I would have a formula on the fifth one that would do the calculations to see. So it took me 15 minutes. That's all it took. 15 minutes to find out are we a metrics and are we not and which agent of mine out of my 30 people was in metrics and which were more which meant I could then go coach them and I could look at why like because we already did call tracking but we didn't have any data to measure okay I can tell you if you did this good or bad but I can't tell you are you doing it with the end the amount of time you're supposed to be doing it because they actually implemented that corporate worldwide and it was a worldwide company and I never got stressed out about those meetings again because I was always in metrics I hired better from that because I learned to profile people looking at that a little bit better I had a brand new epiphany so everything that I do for my clients has stemmed from the experience of being under constant threat of losing my job and watching watching the cycle of Easter, right? Like, Hey, we're all good. all good. Oh, we're gonna lose our jobs. Like we, the sky is falling with really analogy, because nobody thought anything was wrong and all of a sudden we're being pulled into meetings and we're being threatened with our jobs. So, um, but it was, it was looking at metrics and figuring out that there are certain numbers that matter and have to be measured constantly and they have to be managed to constantly. And if those things are done, then everything else is kind of smooth sailing. So anyway, then went and applied it to these different things.
00:15:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is So, why did you stop selling the coffee shop millionaire?
00:15:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I quit working for them.
00:15:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, so I never sold it. Oh, sorry. thought that was your product, but you're right.
00:15:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was this other dude. I remember this now. Yeah, yeah. And he called me on a Sunday and kept calling me and texting me and I told him I don't work on the weekends and I do not talk to anybody on. Sundays. And he was like, I know you're there, like, why aren't you answering? I was like, Oh, I had no other money, no other income for kids going through a I was already going bankrupt because I was making them all this money and they're paying me $15 an hour. And he wasn't going to treat me like that on top of it. Like, bye. So he tried to hire me again a couple times after that. But yeah, anyway, yeah, they had no structure. And then was your strength, your strength labs, they were doing good. I just came in and they did much, much better. Like, regs, this is what Matt Davis said they were doing 400,000 a month. And that I, and then they sold the company for $10 million a couple years later. Do you have a testimony from them saying they went from 400,000 most to eight, I do Matt. And you know, the only way that I got it was because he wanted to hire me again. Yeah. And because Ryan wasn't going to give it to me. So this is what Matt said. Something put Tina keeps getting us results in. She came to help out our company when we were having some growing pains and needed to help cleaning up our systems. At that point, we were doing a few hundred thousand per month, fast forward, 12 months, and we've increased our revenue tenfold. Tina played a huge part in helping us to do this rapidly. She took our ideas and visions and made them a reality and we couldn't have grown this fast without her. That's 100% too. So what I did for them is I put everything in base camps. They had meetings on a regular basis and they were not due dates and they were not accountability. So Ryan did a really good job of saying what he wanted done, but he didn't want to manage anybody. And Matt had a very different personality. He just had his first baby. And he did research, whatever. They were very different personality types. then on top of that, we had a... a media buyer was just either Ellison and graphics and things like that, everything had to be coordinated and done. So there was nobody keeping track of anything. And it was just the virtue of keeping track of everything, having 18 meetings. So we were all on the same page and me saying, okay, who's doing that? When did you get done? then the week, okay, where we are because you haven't said there's any problems. So I'm expecting it's going to be done on time. And a few times of, well, no, it's behind and a few times of I didn't get it done, but I didn't say anything and me going, okay, that's unacceptable, either fix it or we find somebody else stuck out done. So, yeah, those were my biggest, I do have like the other stories would be testimonial stories that I have from people and they're they're good. But the thing is, I haven't worked for a ton of people. What I've stated. in areas and done well for a while. also, I never worked more than 20 hours a week. And a lot of people have locked me in experience, but not in efficacy. And that's really kind of the whole thing about it. So anyway, that's that's my homework. have some trainings that existed that could be repurposed and just kind of refreshed a little bit for just general tips and tools and a story behind it to say, this is what these types of simple systems, that's the thing, they're not none of them are complicated. about this is super fancy. about anything that I do is really exceptional. It's not it's not I show up consistently and I measure the things that matters and matter and I manage the things that matter every single day. And that's it. And don't allow distractions too. So this is the other thing is, each of these companies and owners would be like, well, would be cool if, and want to do other things. And I would say, okay, if you do that, are you still going to get this done on time? If you do that, is that more important than this thing? Because every time you've wanted to go off and do this, then you neglected this.
00:20:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And so I have refused to work for anybody that sabotaged the work that we've agreed to do.
00:20:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm like, I'm either staying on task or I'm leaving because you're sabotaging my ability to do my job, and I'm not going to deal with that kind of stress.
00:20:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And it's not sort of what you're doing for Dan right now? Ryan?
00:20:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Ryan? Yeah, it's what we did. But having been seven years in, he doesn't really have to be in questions. asked you, well, why do it that way? And it was cost or have you followed up with this? So because he does have a lot of different things going on. But the difference with him and everybody else is that his pace is very chill and laid back and can be because he's got a business that runs like clockwork and does really well. And even when something goes wrong, it's still really good. they have to check out the page just and they bled money and he like, it'll fix it. It'll work.
00:21:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anybody else will lose their mind.
00:21:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Dan is really like not one to compare to anything else. But I would think, um, see, he is not a testimonial kind of person. He has said something before.
00:21:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's like, there you go, Tina, that's the best you're ever going to get. it was amazing. I didn't. Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah. Remember when I had to call him, he showed
00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, that fun. I think it was a CPA thing or a counting thing or something like that.
00:22:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, it's like this. Yeah. Okay. So it's Chris. Yeah.
00:22:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And Dan Meredith, it was, was wanting to get into copy. He was copywriting, but he was kind of new at it and he had his gym. But he did everything on notebooks and he just, I think he didn't define his values in the beginning. And so that was one of the conversations. And then it was stick to them, you know, and his values were shifting. And that's something that people have to take into account because values do shift generally until you kind of lock into your real core values and then they really never shift, not the main ones. But there's a point in most people's lives where they're shifting, shifting, shifting until they lock. I think kids are locked in now, but then they were definitely in flux and it was just the conversation about what you want, be clear about what you want, be honest about what you want, be aware of the way that you're sabotaging your opportunities to get what you want and stay focused, stop trying to please everybody, stop trying to, you know, don't say that you want to be a business owner and then also want to go play and do all these things, like which one matters most? If you want to play most, be honest about that and go do that. But don't act like you're a business owner that you care about the business. And so those are the conversations to have with a lot of people and like I've got one client and he's an eight figure client and he wants a lot of growth and but what he wants most is freedom. And so, the kind of growth that he wants requires more management than he wants to put in, and I said, that's okay, but you just have to be aware that there's this disconnect and pick the thing that you want most and the thing he wants most is to not have to show up in the office when he doesn't want to show up in So, then you have to be okay with, you know, 80, 20, right, this 20% of the time that you're not there, that a lot of stuff is just not going to be optimized and working the way that it should, but it's so profitable, and it gives you everything else that you want, except for the massive success that you want, you know, you have to be with the trade-off that you're not getting to the level of accomplishment that you want to, because the other accomplishment is you have a ton of freedom. Freedom and happiness that other people will never have.
00:24:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, yeah, true. Um, I wanted to also though, uh, I kind of, I didn't do my story all that yet, but I did do, I listed off a whole bunch of products and I had a Google She already for some other products with my own possible brand name, but I wanted to segue straight to Joanne because like, oh, yeah. Sorry. It's okay. It's okay.
00:25:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
because I have a three o'clock.
00:25:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I got half an it's all, it's all good. And so like, do we want to just see what she's given me already?
00:25:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Yeah, because I haven't even gone through all the stuff that she sent over.
00:25:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's been crazy. Either by either by.
00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll let you share.
00:25:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Just to have a gander here, some stuff I just started filling out. I have like so many things, like micro offer magic is my main course, but I have like from likes to members. 7-figure offer launcher, I-impossible sales system, traffic and sprint workshop, I-impossible sales system. I'm all over the map, ADHD, can see, I have e-commerce email promotions, swipe send profit, I-impossible success system, that was like teaching people how to make their first 1K and was like a Facebook group. I have scale of challenges and also the ultimate challenge masterclass is challenges kind of on the OG for way back in the day before everybody else is doing them. Ultimate webinar, and that's how I made my first million through those $17 challenges. Ultimate webinar sales, visibility workshop, ultimate Facebook group, cash injection, I wouldn't look at this now because I don't believe in Facebook groups as much right now, even though people are still using them, love and ways to grow good fast and then old stuff, like we're talking like from more than 10 years ago, get published mastery. Well, this one's not 10 years, this was three years ago, this was a 3K, six month cohort, I mean like 25K. one month selling it, a social sales system, just teaching people how to make money on social sales using Facebook groups or Facebook or social media and bring them to a book or call funnel or selling, know, cohort. Fast-cast mastery, these are old ones now. If I were to say the first ones, this was the first one. The first one that really took off, I had the ultimate consulting challenge. I think I first sold for a buck and five bucks. Thousands went through it. Like I had 6,000 buyers of this low ticket that I increased at four and I said, this was a great kind of catalog model to everything else because as I got all these buyers, then I would have an ultimate Facebook challenge because to be a good consultant, they needed no social media. I would have mobile challenge to be a consultant.
00:27:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They needed to learn how to also deal with mobile optimized websites because remember, this is like 12 years ago.
00:27:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Then I had social media challenge because being a consultant, they needed to learn how to use social media. same thing to make it's all you hadn't learned video. So that call me calm automated in me offering a social media certification program down here. And that was a 2k program that certified people in social media. And that was back in 2010 or 11. So I sold 200,000 one week social is at that time no one had a social media certification. Everybody knows brother has that now vacation.
00:28:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I guess before Kate Buck had social media manager pro.
00:28:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is before Kate Buck existed. This is back.
00:28:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that was great.
00:28:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Wow. Yeah, was. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Social media certification program like innovator. Yeah, like the thing is, you know, what means I'm usually always innovating on what's trending right now and using what, you know, kind of like a superstructure what people all know and stuff. And I had momentum like once I had this all going, I had such momentum.
00:28:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, that had been costing though.
00:28:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It was because every month I was launching something new. It totally was right, but I had team like I use these and that's different. Yeah I was using base camp.
00:29:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I had a really good team like you know, and I had a lot of JB partners So it was I was I was true leader like in the CEO of the of the business We were making at least a hundred thousand a month and I was you gonna have a great podcast episode about this and break this down And some trainings about what because there are different seasons, you know And we use stuff like that and like I was the first thing I was gonna say My head is like that was not a leverage business except for you were leveraging trends For business opportunities and revenue opportunities because another thing I was thinking Earlier today. I was like I would never do X. I would never do X. Like all I was listening to a podcast They were talking about the restaurant business and how hard it is and it's such like Fin margins. I'm like I would never do that and I'm like but what if that was the only thing I could do to make money What if that was thing I knew, what if I had no other skills, like, yeah, what mind to say, I would stick up my nose and say, I would never do that. And also where he if nobody did that. And so I kind of caught myself in my ignorance and against, like, I, because first of all, I don't believe in infinitives for the most part, never always this type of thing. Because for the most part, I think there are very few things that are eternally and infinitely ever true. But that the seasons are really important. And I think as coaches or consultants or whatever or leaders or teachers, is that we help people understand that there is a season where something does not make sense for you, don't do it. But only you can know that and other times where it does. But like, because if you go listen to somebody who's telling you to do something that's not compatible with your season, your environment, your skills, do our values, et cetera, then you are creating, that is a recipe for disaster on a spiritual level, on an emotional relationship level, like anything that you do something is just so counter to those particular things, an environment, skill set, relationships, values, whatever. It's destructive inside and you'll just implode in. But this is amazing, all of your things. You put time, could you put a timeline to the left, roughly like 2010, like drag it down for whatever ones you did in that area?
00:31:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sure, I'll do that later just because I want to talk about it. Sorry.
00:31:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's so much.
00:31:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm just like, whoa. Yeah, no, no, I've been thinking about that too because they'll even show people how many products I've created and stuff. video ads made easy. was more in 2016. That was before people were teaching about video ads. Because one of my nephew, I brought his e-comm company to 1k day in sales using video ads, and we sold it 18 months later from startup for over a million dollars to venture capital company, that to e-comm company. Facebook ads scale, that was probably 2020, Black Friday, Cyber Monday Toolkit, that's probably 2020.
00:32:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, is that what made you post the...
00:32:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, because I just have to change dates, like the email's already done and everything, so yeah. That's awesome. Email-deliverability class, I actually did that a few months ago because I wanted to start doing some master classes to then put into little ticket funnels.
00:32:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You looked as crazy as I started teaching about that in 2000, it was with coffee shop just talking about it, and it's actually how I had my first conversation with my sweetheart because he had an email list. So they were getting 10,000 names on it a day.
00:33:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
he's like, whoa, yes, 10,000 names, 10,000, 10,000 often today.
00:33:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's big time. Yeah, but yeah, but they, but they didn't, but it was a new thing to be thinking about sender scores and reputation and inbox placement, that kind of thing. But but I was learning about it because it was impacting us at that time. So yeah, yeah, yep.
00:33:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anyway, wow, that's pretty well. Anyways, okay. So I'm just going to sit you this alive.
00:33:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean, well, this is shows what it's probably so you are.
00:33:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I'm so glad you did this. And Frank Kern promoted this, by the way.
00:33:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was funny. I found him on my list when I was looking through my email list. Oh, yeah. Yeah, Frank at Frank Kern dot com.
00:33:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
think it was funny. Yeah. So okay, so let's go to this girl by the way. Hey, I did post another comeback just for the hell of it. Hey, I'll do a done for you funnel. I don't know if they've released it yet. Uh, but I said they have to have $20,000 working capital. So just FYI just posted that today. Um, just to say my self time because people have been reached out to me, but they like want me for implementation and they want something for cheap.
00:34:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyways, it looks like I've improved yet, but all right up in here.
00:34:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:34:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what was, uh, that's the thing though. So this time next week, Maria, if we, if we spend this, we really, um, putting these things, these two things together. And even if we just like record ourselves having conversation about the things that we've done and built and who we served, then go frame the offer after somebody can be like, who are you?
00:34:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've never heard of you. And then they go watch. This is what you did.
00:34:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:34:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know what I mean? Yeah, there's only once like glitch because it's Canadian Thanksgiving this weekend.
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I am. Taking Friday money. Oh, okay.
00:35:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's only glitch. It's FYI. I think it's Joanne, right? I was gonna dump her stuff into one of the Google Doc because she sends me so many things. Well, look at the free group. You should probably look at my new funnel. We are in the process of making. I don't want to get dropped into too much.
00:35:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's red clogs all over the place. Those are the types of people. They want you to work without money and you realize me looking at your stuff is you taking my time.
00:35:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, we could turn the table and look at something, make some if you want to continue with us and I can just give it the CMO.
00:35:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
COO's thing is that it hates 6,000.
00:35:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you want to do this, like, or out? Or something else that's, yeah, because it's just, um, yeah, I mean, I can do two YouTube videos in the time that we took to talk to her that three hours that one night, then I would have, you know, tons of views on YouTube and build in my YouTube channel, you know, yeah, so I think it's important to see you see what if you can improve what we have, we have six, so that's the other end flag, we have six ages, she's trying fail, so I want to be fully transparent. So she repeats that a lot too, by the way.
00:36:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, um, what's the common denominator?
00:36:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Of why the agency tried to fail, I don't know.
00:36:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She is the common denominator. Her business is the common denominator.
00:36:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, because I can't believe that she would hire a new agency now and expect them to beat the past agencies when it's like the election month's coming up and it's most time to run ads. Yeah, you know, so she's probably going to complain about these guys, you know, unless she's because I said it, maybe that's in her ear now, both.
00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
These guys. Well, the other thing is when you go into somebody like that, like the odds that you're going to succeed are slim and then your reputation is messed up because they go around, this person couldn't do it either.
00:37:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
not going to put myself in that situation. Yeah, so she keeps talking about this funnel. I was thinking while we look at the free group, we should probably look at my new funnel, so I'm just going to highlight this new funnel. So I don't know where what her new funnel is. I think it's important for you to see if can improve what we have. So really she wants us to come in and optimize her business.
00:37:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's the thing. I never talk about this because it hasn't come up too much, but people have to have, so there's a minimum amount income to have at least... 50% profit margins so that they've got some working capital. She does not have 50% profit margins and she's got maybe like 10%, I don't hold on let me see, she said 2.6, so I to do this, 1, 2, well let me do this. What percentage of $2.6 million is $600,000? I'm just going to show my likes on 23%, yeah 23% margins, okay 6, 1, 2, 1, 2, divide by 2, I have 60% so I have no idea if you can see my animals but I'm going to turn my share screen off.
00:38:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay and because it's just really funny because the cat and dog are almost beside each other and that's
00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
not that often you see the baby's where's the baby's oh barely see i know hold on let me let me try and reorganize this oh my gosh the cats in the cat bed and the dog is right there leading up against the couch oh is that funny i just don't see that that often love it really just looking away he's all tired up because he was at the doggy daycare i picked him up just about an hour ago yeah she's funny she's got that they're adorable she's got 23 profit margins and i mean there are businesses that have that but before it being virtual and i mean it's just poorly run yeah it needs a massive overhaul um it sounds like a lot of stress i'm not interested in a lot of stress yeah that's the biggest thing i as much Such as somebody's mission excites me is I'm not going to go into somebody else's home and and stay there if it's chaotic.
00:40:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, and what I love what you just said, that's where we're down, honestly, like my energy just increased. I don't even notice it because it's like how refreshing will be able to say on a podcast or videos. Hey, if you if you have a business that's doing over $50,000 a month with 50% profit margins, we can help you. Boom, like it's that crystal clear, you know, and because I've been frustrated with the calls I've been getting over the last two weeks because. And I created the situation because I did three months ago, the 2k offer and then the 997 a month. So let me turn the box around silent. And yeah, I'm just like, the hell, I'm not going to work for you for for free or like especially with that one lady was like, why don't need a coach. I actually just need someone to implement stuff and she needs to figure out how to move her stuff to go high level. I'm like, I'm not your gal. So it's just like, I don't even know why I thought the pocket CMO COO doc was pretty clear, but then when they get on the phone with me, they want me to implement. That makes sense?
00:41:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it might be that they're mixing old offers with new ones and just thinking about something that they were already sold on in their mind before. And then you became top of mind again, but we feel the old offer. Now, they don't have to have those kind of mop, or the bigger the company gets, the less likely those margins will exist. So, you know, nothing lower than 30 if you're at 100 k a month. I don't want to, I'm not going to be there if it's less than basically it's about how much, how much money is being made and set aside. So 50% profit margins of 50k, there's, there's 25,000 left to be investing in people and teams and systems and ads. there's a reason that I said that specifically. Now, yeah, so it's, it's about knowing that you have enough to pay my fees. Yeah, plus ads and other people. So it isn't just a random number.
00:42:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So, okay, so let's see what else you sent us. Um, did she put this in frickin Googled?
00:42:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, she says she used a computer, right? Oh, that's a no.
00:42:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would not work with somebody who doesn't use She typed this app.
00:42:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She sent chat GBT. Before she dropped that in, she says, I'm gonna go to chat GBT and get you something. So I think she did that there. Which was interesting. don't use Google Docs or have a computer, you chat GBT. Like that's, I don't know. Oh, I don't know how old she is, but she didn't do
00:43:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Brianna, she's in her fifties for sure. If they used to do the road tour of all the female singers back in the day. So, oops, showed. I know it's a little ugly, but, um, and then she gave us access. Let me know. I'll write to Marima partner to be on the call and give you access to everything and talk you through how we run TTM. Well, thought that's what the call last week was about, but took three hours. Here's the free community. Oh, I thought she gave me access to the community.
00:43:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So another requirement I have, Maria, that the so because everything that I was about leverage and optimization. Yeah. I. I don't work with anybody that is, um, not focused. I don't know if she wanted and she's not focused. She's focused on her goal and her mission, but not when it comes to structure and organization, like her mom doesn't, didn't even want to charge money. And she's like, I just like, she, she's focused on a huge number of revenue, but not margins. She didn't even know what her margins are. So what I won't do is teach somebody who's making that much money, business values, and act like I'll train beginners that stuff, not one on one, but through courses, right? But I'm not going to teach somebody who's already responsible for other people's lives and making millions of dollars, the fundamentals anymore, because there are that will work with me that I don't have to do that with. Like, there are people who are making millions of dollars and want the kind of help you and I have because they want to go further, but they're not a giant mess. They just don't have the person who will also, like they're leveraged and optimized in their brain, but they don't have anybody else who will do that in the business for them. So they have to be that person.
00:45:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
00:45:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When she does, she wants that, but the positioning would have to be incredibly clear. This is what you get from us. It's going to cost X. We're going to do this a little bit and your team is going to have to do the rest of it. We're basically going to tell you what should happen, give you the targets, help make sure everybody's clear on why we're doing it, how we're doing it, and then other people will do it. We will not actually do the work. will, you get our brains. you get our experience, you get our leadership, but we are not the operators.
00:46:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I am not anybody's operator. Yeah, I think that's the shift that I'm going through now, too. And that's why I find it interesting because some people like still want me to be their operator, you know. So yeah, um, available. Yeah. So, so it's still one core problem or problem.
00:46:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Brian Moran offered me 30% of a new company if I would come down to Austin and run it for him. But I don't, I'm like, I'm not interested in that kind of like this work.
00:46:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
wouldn't want it.
00:46:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, tell me Tina, everybody has a prize.
00:46:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, you're set to douche back. You don't use a douche bag, yeah?
00:46:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. So, plays nice and tries to wants to be liked, but anyway.
00:46:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, um, what, what is she at the end of the day? So I'm in the, I'm in the Facebook group. This is breastfeeding, so we're in this group right, breastfeeding out. Like, there's two groups. is your question, please? One thing we would need to know is what's her org chart?
00:47:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I know she doesn't have one, but she'd need to create one. Who's on your team? What do they do? How much do you pay them? How many hours a week do they work? How good are they at what they do scale of one to ten?
00:47:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you want me to ask her to do that?
00:47:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, if you have any interest in working with her, you need to know those things. Because that's an asset you need to know. So, like, if you're not going to be the operator, somebody else is. Who would you be working with?
00:47:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, can you send us an org chart of your business and what their roles are?
00:47:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who works for you? First names, last initial. What are their roles? are their and Where are they located? How many hours a week do they work?
00:48:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And In words for you, including these include subtrumptor everyone.
00:48:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. We need the names so that we can differentiate between people when we're looking at it. And know that, you know, like, if one person occupies two spots, we need to be able to tell.
00:48:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What are the roles and responsibilities?
00:48:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where are they located? many hours a week they work? Yes.
00:49:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do they work?
00:49:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How long have they worked for you? Scale of one to 10. How good are they at their job?
00:49:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anything else?
00:49:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What has your team consisted of in the last two years? What people were here in the last two years that are not here now. Why are they not here now?
00:49:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So what has your team consisted of in the last two years?
00:49:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh-huh. That is different than what you have right now.
00:49:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Who's missing?
00:49:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're left, Who's missing and why are they missing? Because this is going to eliminate leadership issues.
00:49:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You mentioned one part in the moment. Okay, so I thought I had this opener messenger and it went back out, I like looking at one's bigger.
00:50:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The other thing I know we talked about it last week and I just want to reiterate it is that she's not doing us a favor, bringing us to the table of big deals. Yeah. You would be doing her a service, giving her the ability to actually handle the big deals that are coming her way and not tank them. There's no lack of opportunity to get money. is a lack now, but there are limitations to what we say yes to. If you wanted to go sell your soul, you could go find lots of people who would throw tons of money at you. you wanted to go burn yourself out, you could find lots of people who would throw big money at you, Maria. You know that. You don't want to do that anymore. No. That's been part of. probably a big part of the issue with their dad being gone is that there's something that happens when we lose people as we start to realize how fragile mortality is and how short it is. And so we want to spend more time with the people that we care about and we are more with their you were conscious of it or not. We're more conscious of the fact that you don't want to spend your time in places that steal from you the life that you do have. And so I don't think you were super like surface level conscious of that but I think your heart was like I can't. I don't want to do that stuff anymore. And even with what's her name? Boutique. Karina. Yeah Karina. Even with that like I think that that was probably more about I mean business business and you like business but also it was about relationships.
00:51:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
know you care about people
00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that you work with partners and friendships. so that was the thing that your spirit is like, I need to like the people that I'm working with. And that was there. But then you weren't being honored properly. I know she had real issues, whatever. She wasn't holding up front of the bargain. So now it's just kind of realizing that there are trade-offs that are acceptable and trade-offs that are not acceptable. This is what's becoming clearer and clearer to you on a daily basis. And so these opportunities, but people even like Joanne, that's not super clear too, because she hasn't figured out what she sabotaging with her chaos or her, I want to make 10 million dollars. And even though she said I want to double the rate of breastfeeding, the thing that she repeated multiple times was 10 million dollars, 10 million dollars, 10 million dollars. You only said, I want to double the breastfeeding rate once. And that's when I asked what the goal of mission was. So the thing is she's actually focused more on the financial goal, according to her own language and energy, then she is on the mission of doubling the breastfeeding rate.
00:53:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I do find it confusing how to help her at this point, like, you know, I'm really thinking that it's probably not a good idea.
00:53:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
think probably the best thing that we could do is, and if we were willing to be benevolent enough to do it, go through this together and say, okay, here's some of the things I would ask.
00:53:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let her answer the questions.
00:53:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If she answers the questions that we gave her structurally, go in and say, look, the best thing that we're willing to do for you right now is give you an audit and we will make a recommendation, which is basically the COO CMO kind of pocket, but modified for her, which is an audit and these are directions we think you want to go. Now, if you want us to implement it. Here's what it's going to look like. It's going to cost you and we're still not going to manage it. We'll help you find an ops manager if you don't have one or project manager. Otherwise we will lead guide and train your manager. It will cost a lot, you know, because we're going to get our $500 minimum hourly and and something like that. But I think that that's all that we do is we give her structure and guidance and potentially train one of her leaders. And and that's just and it's truly honestly it's benevolence whether and if she doesn't see it that way and doesn't want it that way, that's okay.
00:54:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Bye.
00:54:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look, everything will be fine. You'll find your people and we're glad to have talked to you. It's a great mission to have. But we have our own missions and they don't particularly align.
00:54:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So it looks like they have the Thompson products. Like it's very weird like I don't even know what. funnel is right it's it's it's just one thing Thompson method for looks like one hundred percent off so it's probably two four seven always on sale she said all like once a month or something once every other month to bring in the cash which then makes it she could probably get to her 10 million by cutting that price in half well this uh this is what she says it for now whatever the price is if you made it because most women especially brand new moms who are learning how to breastfeed in the first place that's where they have a poorest when you're young and having your first child oh so you think this is too expensive hundred twelve twenty Canadian it's not that I don't think it's that valuable I think that that if they cut they could offer it to more people so there's different ways of scaling right um one of them is getting more cut
00:56:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Customers the other one is getting less customers more priced now. I don't know what the the support level is And I don't know if that's feasible But I do know that this particular thing is something that is more important at one season in life And that's your first baby And now I needed all the way with every one of my children because I never got it figured out So that's that's not the limitation, but it's most needed with your first baby And the first baby is usually when you're youngest and poorest So taking that into account in the market What happens if you reduce the cost? Yeah And you could even call it like a first baby special whatever doesn't matter if it is or not if somebody wants it and it causes them to convert We don't care for it's your seven baby.
00:56:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know Would a mother notice The order bump is discover how to safely collect in store of Colostrum and dr. Rob is masterclass for just $24 and learn whether it's the right to
00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
choice for you and your baby's well being what is colostrum like so when you first when you're before your milk comes in um you and even while you're pregnant you ooze out colostrum which is loaded with antibiotics cows have it in fact i don't know if you've ever heard the supplement called armora um they sell it because now they get it from cows and people take it as a supplement so it's but but mother's colostrum is loaded with the most powerful vitamins and antibiotics for the baby to improve their health but once your milk comes in there's no colostrum it's just milk so but you get colostrum all throughout your pregnancy every month's different but i've never heard about storing that that's not a normal common thing you might be able to youtube it but i'm 48 half four kids and two grandkids and i've never heard about or thought about storing colostrum
00:58:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, what I'm also thinking is, is that, um, that order bump is probably terrible, uh, converting right now, because in the way that it's listed, yes, well, yeah, I don't even know if that should be the order bump, maybe some other different order bump, like for $7 something, like even maybe a meditation to calm yourself while you're pregnant, I don't know, but just I don't think a confused mind says no, and I don't think every pregnancy will know what the hell that is.
00:58:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, um, I think they will, yeah, if you've studied anything about breastfeeding and got to the point that you know that that's the first kind of milk that comes in, and it comes in before milk, also a lot of women will leak it, and that's one of the signs that they're even pregnant, um, before they have babies, and so they're like, what is that, and then they go ask the question and they learn what cholesterol moves. I knew I was pregnant two days after I got pregnant, way before you could go, because of that. were just so sore and they were leaking. I was like, what is this? Milk's not supposed to come in now, and my mom's like, that's colostrum. And then I knew the difference when my milk came in, because I was rock hard, it was extremely painful. didn't know could get rock hard, but they just like overnight milk came in, and it just was so painful. Like, have you ever had any part of your body be so swollen that you could, like it was shiny and you could just feel the pain of the swelling, just the swelling, not an injury per se, but just swelling? Yeah, my knee, but it wasn't shiny, but yeah, my knee. Yeah, so that but breasts. Terrible. Have you ever tested different price points and what are the conversion rates over those different price points? Are you late for a call?
01:00:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
She's okay. Well, this will be interesting because if she doesn't give us all this information that shuts the door on spending even more time on her, right?
01:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yes, exactly. And I think that what's probably going to happen is she's going to Um, this is, this is, this is my thing is I get, and I ask a question, whatever. people like, yeah, no, never mind. I'm like, okay, that's fine.
01:01:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know, yeah, I think, I think if I could go back in time, I probably would have told her, let just just pay a six thousand off our thing, pay two thousand for, for like the first, um, you know, analysis, like all it, you know, that we'll do for you. Let's go from there. And then, cause right now, um, I'm not motivated to work much for her.
01:01:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, and she's already had someone to my time. I wouldn't do it for that. I'd do it for at least four thousand. So split two, two for you, two for me. It's taken too much, like this type of thing, a new business. You have to wrap your head around a lot of stuff. And you have to wrap your head and it's the energetic exchange with a person. That is very draining. That's not just showing up and doing work.
01:01:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
New people are new exhaustion. And so she, she, sorry, go ahead.
01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. there's a price to pay for that is all like I'm only willing to make a certain exchange for that.
01:02:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah and she she has the warning signs because it's sort of like this guy I'm talking to at 5.30 today knows me from Ellen's tennis group message me and said the guy that built my funnel everything he's changing his business model so he's no longer running ads and working optimizing funnels so I'm left with out that talent is that something you can do can we talk and so boom we're talking and then right away he sends me the here's the funnel pages and I stopped running ads but if you want the conversion rates let me know so it's very like there's no energy drain like it's it's like okay let's get to it this is what I yeah yeah but without payment so just keep that in mind because it's also simple like did he pay you?
01:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know because he wants to talk about whether I do that kind of thing to help him okay okay like like just don't I wouldn't go giving away free advice whatever just I have seen people take that way very easily by starting to send you stuff and wanting you to look at it. That's taking your time. Like, I'm willing to do it on the call with you this amount of time. I'm not going to go dig into it. Your job now, if I'm talking to you is you're going to walk me through this on the call. not giving you any extra time other than the call. If we come to an arrangement on the call, then you pay me, then I'll look at it. But this calendar time I'm giving you is all I'm giving you until I know what you're going to pay.
01:03:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know what I mean?
01:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, there's just so many tire kickers, like, and you have to be careful. types of people, the funnel, you know, managers, or ones, whatever, but anyway, I just protective of you.
01:03:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Thank you. No, but you're right. Because yeah, when I was doing those free onboarding calls in Scoop Group, yeah, majority of them was bad. And I'm like, okay, why am I doing this? This is stupid. And that's why I made it five bucks a month instead of free, and you're in a min on it. And I changed it to business accelerator. or so.
01:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah. My, so I know you got to go. I'm just going to do this. I have a linear path. And to me, it is get our histories, like our pedigrees basically written and figure out what we could do with our existing products. What are the ones? How quickly could we get them repurposed into a tiny little package, a small little type of offer. But then with the pedigree, and here's what we've created, are you interested in talking to us about whatever, but it's, you know, the high level price. And instead of worrying about conversions, I just trust that the right people will come into that. And in the meantime, you can do the, you know, our consulting or whatever, but then you're not committing yourself to fulfillment. When you get off the call, you're done. You don't have to think about them anymore. But at some point, one of those phone calls will probably lead to Maria, I need you. You can be like, here's the price. And I won't do the implementation. But what I can do is, lead your implementer. And I can direct your implementer potentially and say, okay, here's what you should do. And this is what it will cost you and you keep that $500 EHR in the back of your mind always. So whatever price you offer is like, okay, well, talk to you for an hour, four times a month and it's $2,000 or $2,500 or $3,000 because you know they're going to talk to you throughout the week a little bit too. And so but I'm not doing it, I will give you the strategy. I will tell your person what they need to do. I'll help you set a base cab so that we can check every week that everything's on track and you get one hour my time. That's it, $3,000, $4,000, whatever.
01:05:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, cool.
01:05:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then you get your money and then you're not burdened and then we can build the scalable stuff as it goes. Love it. Okay, I'll let you go.

Okay, can you hear me?
00:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, can you hear me? How are you doing?
00:00:11 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Getting a little tired of all the body blows. Gotta be honest. Been a lot of stuff for the last two or three weeks.
00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's going on?
00:00:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
We have the Washington Bar Company, the New Mexico lawsuit in Bar Company. Tyler potentially missing the statue. Tyler slash Nate slash cat. Potentially missing the statue. Friday getting an earful from Sweet James because they also signed the client of ours and got mad that we were trying to write their name when that wasn't the case, so we're hearing that out at 12 today, but that's a minimum $200,000 loss for me, which sucks. It is what it is. And we kind of like... The survey cases that are relatively new, email us, tell us that they don't want to be represented in. And what about HQ intake? We're still sending our leads to HQ intake and they're going to us, so we're doing double work. So it's just getting the point where it's a lot.
00:01:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, what's good?
00:01:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Um, great to have a big check last month. That's always good. We've signed up a good number of cases last month, despite having a lot of drops and subouts, so that's still good. We put together a new incentive plan that we rolled out to the staff, so it should be good. Obviously, it costs us money, but hopefully we'll get everyone incentivized to try to get the goals together. Oh, I took a new job with a pain doctor, so that'll be good for her. And yeah, that's what I got.
00:02:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tell me about the incentive plan, and is that going to increase payroll?
00:02:35 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. By about 15 grand a month.
00:02:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A percentage is that.
00:02:46 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Payroll or.
00:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Total so payroll was around 37% what's it now?
00:02:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't have last month number yet. Because it's on the bed, so there's still. I know that her payroll last month was really high and give you a rough estimate of what it was.
00:03:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:03:48 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, we also have someone trying to commit fraud against her trust account. So that's cool. Sorry, Arizona. Trying to pay their gas belt with our. Where they're trusted, yeah.
00:04:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:04:10 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Awesome.
00:04:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's. Okay. Okay.
00:04:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay, we were. California was two. Seventy eight before taxes and everything else. They were buying good taxes. Oh, the employee benefits, Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. And You $409,113.
00:06:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What was your revenue for July?
00:06:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
$1.1. $1. $1. So, I'm, is this short?
00:07:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, now we're 40 percent and when did that get rolled out?
00:07:40 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Thursday. So, yeah, sign in this.
00:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's, what's changed in the structure?
00:08:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
They hit both money angle and settlements, it's a thousand of each person. If they want hit one of them, it's 500.
00:08:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One of the stats on hitting those goals across the teams.
00:08:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It hit it three or four months this year. It's not every time, but it's frequent enough that it's not impossible, I guess. It's definitely doable. I think done it multiple times. Thanks
00:09:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I don't think that that's, I think it's a good thing to me. I mean, obviously, you did too because you did it, but that makes sense to me, that I mean, I guess it just depends on how much revenue difference that makes money and goals and settlement.
00:09:30 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What's the settlement goal? Three million.
00:09:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:09:36 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
The logic is not every case that settles you're going to paid out right away, just because it takes We made it clear that the goals will increase over time. Right. We're adding more people. or adding more states, writing more cases, like it's not going to stay this way.
00:10:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Will the payment increase or just the expectations?
00:10:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I think just the expectations because quite frankly, for adding more people and more teams, it's hard to justify increasing the amount per person when we're adding more people. It doesn't make sense.
00:10:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Talking to, I assume that you would have had a conversation with your attorneys about this. So wait, let me ask this first of all, in Patrick's team probably won't even have enough to get to those goals. It's a real wide goal. And then the attorneys that are already paying out of pocket for their teams for their incentive program or are they going to Okay, this what?
00:11:02 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
This is separate from that.
00:11:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What I what I was asking is, would you think that they're going to pull back what they're already doing or keep that the same?
00:11:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I've talked to them and they've all said they're going to keep the same.
00:11:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so who does that besides Samantha and Marin's?
00:11:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Nick doesn't because it doesn't really make sense given their volume. Patrick isn't on a percentage. So it wouldn't make sense for him to do it and Hank doesn't. Again, a percentage to noon.
00:11:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. This doesn't take away from them. I wouldn't see why they would do it other than just being short-sighted and thinking that that would be How much do they pay out, do you know individually each month to their teams and internet programs?
00:12:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know exactly. Sam's a little better because she gives part of her quarterly bonus to them. She has 6,000 divided by her team and she'll pull us out like during the month. Tyler is more ad hoc. I think he's probably giving his team a round of grand that total.
00:12:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so the people I have on Samantha's team is Thelma, Valerie, Victoria, and Jalissa.
00:12:43 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
that still correct? No, Jalissa never wanted, never ended moving over. She made more money doing it and take the script.
00:12:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so does she only have three people?
00:12:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
She's got Liz helping her a little bit. we've got Liz training with her before that is kind of cool. time would think.
00:13:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And in what role? Can you send it right?
00:13:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Sure.
00:13:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. Just helping. Yeah. I was Hank doing.
00:13:29 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Um, we've got a standing meeting every Wednesday to go through his cases and what's going on. So I talked a little bit on Wednesday last week, um, going through his cases, kind of how these are built. New cases look okay. he's just trying to scrape some of these, you know, crack their cases through. Uh, he had, not a complaint, but, you know, said it was a little tough with him in the same office, even though the office is made for four people. Um, just because sometimes they're working around. each other and we get a little loud if they're both on the phone, so we end up just getting her a separate office. They're on like a scene like what they're near each other.
00:14:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's that gonna cost you different?
00:14:24 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
600 bucks a month. It's not enough to worry about to keep two people happy. I would agree. One thing he did say, which I did find interesting and was actually kind of also anyway, he said that clients have been showing up to the office, like they want to come in more. And so I was talking to Steve, he's like, yeah, our Phoenix office, like clients love to come in. Like it's weird, no other place they do that, but in the Phoenix area they love to come in. So, I think longer term is actually a good thing having a Phoenix office, so it should help us with retention and hopefully with the hurdles.
00:15:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or be more of a bottleneck because it slows things down and people get more chatty. That be interesting to see if there's less sub-out or if there's more referrals from the Phoenix office from previous customers, things like that, would be really interesting to see how, what the correlations are to anything, very interesting, so let me go look at this. Pink's not even on the team, and I look at matters by team, hold on, yeah, that's this year.
00:16:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So, because we started to give them about one or two new cases a week.
00:16:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What was the first thing you said before giving one or two?
00:16:23 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You have some because it's getting one or two weeks, so it definitely has cases.
00:16:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So. Screen to real quick. So this is one of the newer reports that. Did he actually say is the newest report I think. So I don't know how accurate this is or. it was made from zoom out of the way more. Okay, so these are the teams, it's finding, how would I see what criteria this report is using? If I edit, maybe.
00:17:21 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And it's probably not going to the resolution closed because he's just starting to get his own cases.
00:17:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So, let's see, okay, so it probably just wouldn't even be in here.
00:17:38 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Also, it looks like he doesn't have his own matter team as he's principal, so I'll talk about that.
00:17:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Oh. Got that.
00:17:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. So, if you wanted to, like, map.
00:18:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
as a report?
00:18:04 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, just letter in general.
00:18:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, sorry, where do you mean?
00:18:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
There's home, chatter. Oh, yeah.
00:18:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:18:15 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And then I recently viewed if you just click where it says you're telling you to left.
00:18:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
00:18:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And then just type in hang. Yep. You can see his list.
00:18:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. So he's got a 50. And status, no.
00:18:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Yeah, they're not using that thing. Progatory was what was supposed to be for soccer to take a look at.
00:18:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just think it's funny.
00:19:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
the file but the offers aren't good enough to take so it's okay.
00:19:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, just making it this. I haven't like did this report like this before so that was interesting. All right, so we can probably stop screen sharing and hey, have you heard from Fuji today?
00:19:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Today?
00:19:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Well, he, oh, okay, he slept through his alarms.
00:19:42 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He missed my call, so.
00:19:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, you baby. Yeah, I'm not mad about it. figured I just wanted to make sure it wasn't something bad. So, you know, mean, new babies are something.
00:19:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
We talked to him again because he got his car. He was doing drier than having fun.
00:19:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, No, and I heard from him yesterday, but he he messaged that he just messaged. I just thought that he slept through his alarm. So it's okay. I'll check in with him. just want to make sure they were okay. So, um, okay, so new incentive program. That's good. You about how are I said, how are you doing? And you're like, okay, body blows, all that stuff. overall, really, how do you feel Um, trying to think of how to formulate that question right now, it just feels little demoralizing, right?
00:20:39 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's just like, you keep pushing and pushing and pushing and Definitely feel like you're moving backwards to some level. What's the point of doing all this stuff and having all this stress when it's just, you know, making progress? Um, it sure lives. I'll get over it. It's just All I want
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, comes in waves like that's exactly right that's exactly right. So, um, I mean, that's, that's perfect. That's just, did I tell you we had another accident? My, my daughter caught in another accident. So we have three, three and three weeks. I'm a place where you can't do any help. Anyway, point being that the craziness, that's exactly how it happens. It's just their seasons, ebbs and flows, and it's wild, but your perspective of, of that, that that that comes and goes being able to recognize that being able to put that into perspective and not let it overwhelm you. I mean, you can't not feel the things you've. can be numb, but that doesn't really serve a good function because then you can't block out specific feelings, you block everything or nothing. I mean, effectively. So just being able to put that into perspective. So last week, hold on, we started talking about that. That's not even the right note, the heck. Um, goals. Did you read Emith again? Or did I ever have you read it? I feel like you said you had read it once before.
00:22:53 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
There's two books.
00:22:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Emith I have. not read not So, you still have it?
00:23:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I already, I haven't had a chance to read it yet.
00:23:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:23:08 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And you can just say that for like what I'm traveling, it's just easy to, you know.
00:23:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And do you have a target for when that can happen? Probably next week. Because I'm traveling next week. And when was the last time you read EMIS?
00:23:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's been a while. I just remember there's like an entrepreneur, the manager and the technician. And like you can be all three, but really focus on one of them. And become good at it and make sure you have the other two.
00:23:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Go find mine and remind myself.
00:24:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
is about like the person who wants to like know more. So the person who like works on your business instead of in your business, is always big.
00:24:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to go to my librarian. It's been a while since I read it, too, in that way. And it's always interesting, though, too, that people pick different things out of books. Now I'm trying to remember where I'm going to find my notes, though. where we landed on just talking about the goals, although I think where you want to go with your business and that's not solidified and we talked about purpose a little bit and then I asked you some questions. let me go back to that because that was offline so I didn't put it in my notes and I need to. And you did not reply back to me. So I asked, what did you think about those two things that I mentioned?
00:25:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Yeah, that was better than people. It's just a short answer.
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is it?
00:26:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Dogs are better than people.
00:26:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't hear you disagreeing. Okay, so I mean dogs can be your purpose. That's not a judgment. I just am looking for specificity. And I would like you to work on that and generally the reasons that will resist specificity around purpose will be internal judgment or fear of external judgment.
00:26:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, I just don't want someone else to go through what I went through and if they have to to have the easier route than what I wonder. It's really what it comes down to. So these are good people generally speaking who want to make the world a better place and they have skills and talents that I don't have. And so if I can bring something to it to connect these things and to help, then it's what I want to do.
00:27:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you realize what you're prioritizing there? That it's not dogs.
00:27:32 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It is to some level because it's the overall goal. These are the people that I would need to be able to get the outcome that I'm looking for.
00:27:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I'm missing something then. Oh, let me go like this.
00:27:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
If you're trying to build a technical project, right? You'd want someone who's like a CTO. or someone who has a technical background, generally speaking, if you're trying to build some sort of new technology. In this situation, that would be the surgical vet or Sayaka for like better term.
00:28:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, these are actually the two. So, of dogs, speaking of dogs. No, I missed my beach on so, oh, no, can't talk about that.
00:28:38 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'll cry. I'm feeling. So, again, for me, if it's a way to help, and all these people come together because they have a skill that I don't have to try to get. it's the outcome that I want. Well, still, you know, there's advantages for me, right? There's tax advantages for the potential business that there's other things going on. It's not pure altruism. But, you know, the main motive here is not necessarily to make as much money as it possibly can for me.
00:29:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so I was just trying to sort though because there are two things that in what you were sharing with me is there having dogs that longer lives and have, you know, better quality lives, but also just because of what dogs give to people. the greater purpose to you is just, and this is not when I say just I don't mean it as a judgment at all. The primary focus would be on dogs. People take care of dogs so they don't get better quality lives unless people are taking care of them. the people are just kind of the means to an end and the end is just the best life for a dog. Yes, do I? Okay, um, yeah. So, and here's another question I haven't asked you about. What other businesses do you have the side suite? besides this, besides what you're doing with Fuji?
00:30:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That's it.
00:30:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. What is your interest in July medical?
00:31:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I work with them. like them. think he's a good person, but that's really it.
00:31:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean. So. There because it makes you happy to be there. Like working with them.
00:31:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I like them. good people.
00:31:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I'm just looking at again, this is no judgment. There's just like trying to figure out. So back to the business is ran by the person. What motivates you? does your time go? Like we haven't talked about time in a long time. We haven't really just, you know, kind of. um, broken down, like you, what you're doing specifically versus just sweet law. And if your time is going to other places, if your priority is elsewhere, or, um, one of the things that I like to look at is where can one action benefit multiple things, um, so just kind of trying to take everything to account. So how much time do you feel like you spend on July medical?
00:32:38 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Can we separate out July medical versus who do you think?
00:32:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
100% and our conversations have nothing to do with those conversations.
00:32:48 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I understand. I'm just saying there's a large difference. July medical less than 1% of my time. Okay. Like, Hey, You know, there's the issue with the client or something else would be the only thing that comes up, but it's it's super rare. So it's not often Fuji I talked to I don't know four or five times a week Yeah, we just talk about everything I know he's had some business ideas for I stuff once my body like with record stuff Things in general. So, you know, I definitely spend A couple hours and we just talk to him, but I don't really think of that as business per se Yeah, that just sounds like friendship.
00:33:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay, okay Sweet lot how much time do you think you spend working on that?
00:33:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
We haven't done any time tracking or So I spent a lot of time thinking about the business A lot Things are going in problems, efficiencies, in efficiencies, in efficiencies, and efficiencies, know, partnerships do we need? What are we lacking? What are we doing well? can we push? lot of time, obviously, on the financial side of what's our cost requisition, what's our end outcome, where are these numbers looking and that type of thing. But I would say it's been the vast majority of my week, you know, we're just working on one. You know, I say vastly, I would say 65 or 70 percent of my, like, weeking, getting a stinking out of it.
00:34:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
On a scale of one to ten, you think about, because I kind of want to rank two different things. And I probably could formulate these better over time, but I'm trying to make a distinction between values. So, what I'm what I'm digging for is how much kind of joy and fulfillment and just value you feel like you get out of the business versus and separate from the level of success that you think that it has. Do you understand a little bit? It's not really and clear that I'm a little bit.
00:36:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, try to put it this way. Starting this, I never had an expectation of being in this position, so I am incredibly grateful and thankful for where I am. The other part of me constantly wants to push the envelope for better force. And so that is always my struggle because there's part of the tail wagging the dog, trying to grow, but we've got to catch up to where our growth's going to be. But at the same time, the question always comes up, okay, so what is the plan? What is next? Where are you trying to get to? I rarely ever have an answer. Sure to remind, I certainly can belong to my doing this. Okay, this business gives me the best chance to make the most amount of money. I don't know what else we'll do. That would give you the same opportunity. I see the cases as a piggy bank for lack of a better term. They're there. They're worth a lot. And so, you know, that's there. I have a lot more flexibility than when it first had when I started this room. Obviously working for someone else. So, you know, I don't want to show up. I don't have to. There's nothing that I have to do. But along with that comes more responsibility, right? So, when the fan, you're the one who's responsible for it at the very, very, very end of the day. So you put in safeguard, you've been processes, but as we grow. As systems break as didn't happen that we wouldn't necessarily expect to more just quite frankly the nature of the business Didn't Mexico lawsuit barfing it's not really anyone's fault. It was just an on the other side. It just is what it is I have to get more used to it because we've had a fairly straightforward run and Or that is some Really easy going and I'm not gonna step over dollar or such trying to pick up pennies Yeah So if You just had All the money that you wanted and didn't have to work Would you work? Yes on what I don't I still think I'll be back here trying And Do the same thing that I'm doing now you know, seeing people be able to buy their houses or get married or, you know, a house to build in their lives because of this is, you know, rewarding. But sitting on a beach, sitting in a drink, it's fun for like maybe a month, but to be bored pretty quickly. But, you know, if you're like, you have all the money in the world, would I go be like a VC or something? Maybe that would be more interesting, you know, helping solve business problems. Trying to figure out how to help people with their issues and problems in a business setting to help them grow and get them where they want to get to.
00:39:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I actually think that you would love that. I don't think that you're there yet, but I think that you would serve there really well. think that it would tick all the boxes for you. and I see that as a huge potential in your future. Personally, I was asking the question. That's what I was thinking about. So that's helpful that there is no needed off-ramp that ultimately, as long as you have autonomy over your time and the place that you work, the energy, the vibe, the structure, that you're willing to pay the price of of liabilities and management and leadership, which obviously, um because you value leadership. So that's helpful when we when we take these approaches because sometimes when you um you know when you're in in the more aggressive mode then we got to do better we got to do this we got to do that whatever the the motivators behind it the drive behind it helps to keep that in perspective. So I'm like that I'm very I'm I call it bull energy because I'm like I will plow through things and get everything done and just to help with consequences but that's not really the truth like that's the energy that comes forth is that you know I'm gonna drive through no matter what but but I always have other things keeping me in check and uh it's just usually more than most people are used to because I'm intrinsically the powerfully driven and motivated, nobody and no theme slows me down, nobody and no theme can infiltrate my goals, my perspective, my values, I guess, all of those things. So, and some days I feel them stronger than others and so, you know, whoever's around is gonna feel it and that's the conversation that comes out but that doesn't mean that just because I'm like, let's go today that I that I've failed to take into account all of the other things or that I'm gonna be, you know, mad and just want to count them all everything because we don't go as fast as I want it to and that's the thing that I've picked up about you but I'm just trying to make sure that I Understand that because I feel like I understand it way better now than in the beginning in the beginning it felt Potentially potentially not necessarily incongruent but opposing values and Now that I understand you better. I think that it's more of energy that ebbs and flows and Because of that sometimes it feels more present than others and things like that. So and and all of this affects pace and In terms of how much to push certain types of things because we can push things But sometimes at at detriment to the business. So For example, we went really really hard on these inventors and and we got a whole bunch of cases and then for a while the team was really stressed and overwhelmed but then that kind of seemed to have balanced out a little bit. You know what though, one thing I would like to look at although I know it's not very high is we're just wondering what the sub-out rate was and I wish that we could have a finger on the pulse of just overall job satisfaction like maybe even monthly that we could kind of watch as the lead volume increases and we get closer to capacity anyway I gotta figure out how to because we have the Lidify dashboard for some things but some of the things that we talk about and try to track aren't things that are in Lidify like that like the MPS scores like the the overall feedback which we've only gotten what your end financial slash time goals are. What I would want to do potentially once a month or figure out some way because at least probably, I mean anywhere from 30 to 50 percent of our calls are not damn related. So I don't know how we would segment it but and this is up to you and you get to choose what your priority is and what you feel like is most valuable to you but what I would like to do is spend a little bit more time on the overall approach for what you're doing with business. How like for Dan, he's got two main focuses and probably because money has not ever been an issue. His CPA exam, another 71 has always been since I've worked with him so profitable. that there's never been a, um, that this really not a focus of the conversation. It's more like, that's a whale, whale machine.
00:47:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
How do we just keep that going?
00:47:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But the other conversations have been really important. And that is, he wants to do cool things with cool people and he needs to be solving puzzles. So like, he may want to retire, but if he did, his puzzles would be music, making music. And so that would be his thing. And so everything that we do in terms of the other aspects of the business that we look like, we'll look at kind of run through that filter of what keeps him happy so that him. Because when he's happy as everything else works well and is more efficient, then he's better at leading and the cool things with cool people means that not cool people and not cool things have to get. out and there was a lot of that that had to be done. were lot of things that really didn't match his values and what he wanted. So anyway, but for you, dogs being so important, so special to you, and knowing that being human beings in life that more hard things will come up, being able to be intentional, organized, structured, strategic around that type of goal and just kind of lending some help to that if you're interested in it. I would like to do that because I feel like the natural consequence of that is sweet law is going to be better for it.
00:48:48 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I hear so much you're saying. You do, I'm sorry, would you say?
00:48:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do. Okay, because I think it'd be happier, but the natural consequence of that is more creativity. There's scientific studies that oxytocin boosts creativity, boosts productivity, but the creativity part is really important because to me, your success in sweet life is about innovation. It's that you do things differently. You've always done it differently from the time it took over. And so if getting to spend time purposely, intentionally, consistently, weekly towards this passion project that also has the ability to be profitable, that also has the ability to potentially get you in position where you could be a venture capitalist and maybe an angel investor or maybe a startup counselor. consultant in maybe having an incubator company. I think that, I just think that creates almost kind of like a moat. Well, so we talked about the financial moat around your business. I think this is like an energy moat around the visionary, around you. Okay. So, um, and I know we're getting short on time, but this is what, okay, so let me just thinking about time. I still want to know what the heck Mary's husband is doing, because just keeps going. It's awesome.
00:50:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, well, you've been going and we're growing it slowly but surely, and I don't mind putting more money. into it if you keep getting the same type of results, right?
00:51:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so also though, let me look at my calendar, because I would like to spend a little bit of time talking to you and why I say a little bit, it's probably at least 30 minutes to an hour about what I'm learning from Patrick and Lauren's. And then is that my smoke alarm? I really hope not. I've been battling those things, changed all of their batteries, reset them all. Yes. But I'm on a call. It's been oh my gosh, unplug them all. don't care. I'll call somebody. Yeah, it will not rip. But yeah. Yes please thank you. Okay so anyway that's something in my eye. So one of the things that I okay so so the unique thing about your business is that you don't have to be in the office and you're hardly around. That sounds wrong but anyway I don't know how much oversight there is and that that's unique to your business for me and I don't know how much of a limitation that is. It's okay so anyway that just means a customized approach to how you do the business because your value is that autonomy and being able to do what you want to with your time and and then creating the best business that you can within within within within those prime which then leads us back to the multiplier concept, which is create better leaders inside of Sweet Loss, so that you don't have to be, and so you don't have to be there, and they're just doing their jobs well, and you're basically just kind of the overseer and almost a consultant to these mini businesses inside of your business. That's kind of how I think matches in aligned with the things that you've told me about what you value. So then if I get to talk with these two business owners, one of them being new, almost like mini franchises inside because they have different offices, different teams, pods, things like that, just figuring out how you can do that, figuring out a system. that supports you not having to be there a lot and continual growth and improvement. So, what does that look like in terms of meetings with them or kind of training just what we're doing? Like, I feel like they're still not really walls in an outline of what that could look like, but it feels like it's coming into view a little bit. So, but our Monday calls, we do cover a lot. So, you said, I feel like you said third.
00:54:44 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, you can't do Thursdays, right? So, I can, yeah.
00:54:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:54:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Not this Thursday, of course, but some Thursdays.
00:54:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And next week, my Thursday is full. And then we capture that.
00:55:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I Here's a, I have to suffer and go driving courses with some one between 1230 and 230.
00:55:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mark, poor Mark, I'm so sorry.
00:55:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's very difficult.
00:55:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you, now if you, um, to take a dog with you, that would even be more terrible.
00:55:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Um, I don't think the dog wouldn't like that. So you're, you're, getting thrown around the car pretty good.
00:55:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, tiny cars. Yeah. Um, okay. How is Ronan, by the way, because somebody just never sent me pictures anymore.
00:55:33 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So really. Yeah, no, I spent most of my Sunday with him. Uh, he's really into the Olympics. He loves to watch it.
00:55:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, hilarious. That is hilarious.
00:55:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
But yeah, he's, he's a big boy. He's, he's a little dog though, which is really problematic.
00:55:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are your Tuesdays?
00:55:56 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Uh, Tuesdays are usually fun.
00:55:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, how about Tuesday? at 13th. Next Tuesday.
00:56:05 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, should be fine.
00:56:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and 10, 11.
00:56:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's definitely pretty wide open. So what will three in?
00:56:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Let's make it this time. 11. I like mornings to be productive, like, use my brain, before I start talking. Speaking of using my brain, it does not want to work right now. Okay, Mark, there we go. Sweet. My. Is that for 13th? Yeah, okay. So that will work. And then, okay, so you're going to revisit Emith and rebuild the cell.
00:57:14 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I read both the cell first and then I'll revisit Emith.
00:57:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And I will as well. And then I just have, I need to formulate just kind of a structure. Now, now that I know that we can have some other discussions kind of try to create that call format so that it's productive as it can be. yeah, the goal is just, I think, I guess what I would like is for you to kind of contemplate ponder on what it would look like to be. just if you had interest in it, maybe an investor and consultant. And what do you intuitively feel like that timeline looks like for you? And if you could create this company for, do you have a name for it or anything? You're that vision? Okay. So, just maybe putting a little bit more specificity into it. Dang it, I was what that could look like is it? I mean, because I see so many potential tangents. of creating medical programs that are training for doctors who have an interest in being specialists, trained by specialists, so that somebody doesn't have to fly to Japan to get their dog, you know, help, as well as the dog food. You know, there's so many different components to it where it could be, you're somehow involved in multiple aspects of what can affect dog health from, you know, taking care of the dog with the diet, the food, but also medical, medical care, I mean, even, I don't know, I've calmed down because then my visionary brain kicks in and thinks about all kinds of things. anyway, just ponder it a little bit more. see if you can put any more specifics on to like just let yourself dream the biggest thing and not necessarily say this is not possible this is possible or probable or likely or any of those things and just what like what would you dream about if you just let yourself dream and let's talk about that and then um so yeah there's too much of my head about this right now have to like let's end right now because i gotta make the phone call okay let's do the thing from last week so let's end out okay

How are you?
00:00:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)

00:01:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nope. No way.
00:01:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yup.
00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I supported PowerMax and the first IMAX and I also worked for Intel as a technician and I built networks and I supported their network adapters and so I talked to people in NASA and the Pentagon and helped them fix their networks and.
00:01:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Holy crap.
00:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's amazing. I can build a network from the ground up like the server including the cables I can crimp the cross over cables and networking cables and I'm a nerd.
00:01:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You're really cool. My first when I left Delight Tush I was actually where for computer sciences corporation when I left Delight Tush they had a hundred of me to go into the States and then when I left them in 1999 I started a software company hosting websites in Southern California and cable Tron systems, the competitor at that time to. that? The big one that's there though, didn't tell anyway funded us like over million dollars to use their servers instead for our server farm and it was a brilliant venture capital financing because like they find us as a million dollars but it was in equipment. So it's a win win for everybody right because that was the most expensive thing at the time. So different now right, but at the time like you could charge $50,000 to build a website and host it for these medium sized companies California.
00:02:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have been in it for a while. Corporate experience was my first business experience I didn't like it's really a long time to get comfortable with certain amounts of money and things and realize that that's what I was doing. Because I did the technical stuff but then I became a technical lead but I was responsible for hiring, managing, training, supporting. meeting metrics, meeting with the clients, meeting with the head honchos at Intel and at Apple. And I would also play Peaceball with them and beat them and then get free dinners because I want like what, learning about staffing and understanding the metrics because we were constantly getting threatened with losing our jobs. They would be going to either Costa Rica or the Philippines. And so the reporting was really archaic at the time and we had Lucid technology systems for our phones before they got bought out by Orion.
00:03:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
think it was or the other way around.
00:03:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah. But, and I fell in love with telephony rooms and systems and IT at that time, but so I figured out how to be proactive about learning our numbers and our metrics because what would happen is we would get yelled at, we would see our person coming down the road now. call centers where all most of them were entry-level job positions. Yeah. people come in and be trained and the managers weren't much better. were recovering drug addicts, you know, like the town that I live in, we rank in the top five for domestic violence and unemployment and poverty, and all these other things. And so that was the hiring pool, which made performing well really difficult. And so most of the head level leaders were imported from other places. But anyway, there was a lot of, you know, not really corporate kind of handling of things, a lot of threats, lot of, a lot of, a lot of, lot of things, a lot of sleeping around, all kinds of more accessible stuff. So, but if anything would go bad, you would just see them just down the aisles like, well, what just happened? Well, they got chewed out by Intel for not meeting metrics. And so now everything flows downhill. I got really tired of having my job buttons. I was a mom and I didn't want to like, I don't want to do this kind of stress. So like, how do I figure this out? And so one of my nerdy friends, who was also LDS, I'm more in church of Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints. Anyway, he's nerdy. And I would see him in Excel all the time. might teach me about this and he taught me about formulas. And I'm like, so if I took this report that doesn't have all the data I want. But if I could plug it into this spreadsheet and then have another tab that got this other report and another tab with this other report, I could pull this data from five different sheets and get a summary tab that had calculations that told us exactly where we are at with metrics. And he's like, yeah. So I took about an hour and figured it out. And so now what used to take people days and several hours to figure out because they didn't even know where to get the data. Which by By the way, the same situation I still find with business owners all the time when I asked their metrics, they're like, I don't even know where to get that. So, nothing's changed because that was, you know, years ago. Yeah, 28 years ago. And so, it would take me, once that started to happen, I just did it every week, every Monday I would get my data, took me about 15 minutes, so I'd import each of them and then just go make sure the calculations were correct and make sure I could wrap my brain around what was happening. They ended up implementing it worldwide, corporation as a worldwide company. And it took me probably 10 years before I realized how exceptional that was, had no clue. But they were using a system I came up with in an hour all over the world. Like, I still think about that, sometimes I think I probably don't appreciate the way my brain works. works and but also this is it simple systems yep so nothing has changed people still over complicate things and mostly it comes down to you they don't ask good questions and then they don't force themselves to come up with the true answer so when i talk with people i saw your post today and i'm like i bet we're very similar to the saying but you will probably ask the question and be like oh wait get the answer go ahead that's how i said i'll just be on a call and and they say i don't know i said okay let's find out and we'll have to go look at this and this i'm i got an hour you paid for it let's go get it yeah yeah yeah well all my other questions i love asking on like more like well it's business coaching but it's really life coaching where a lot of them always say like this is not to be about kpi's or metrics but specific to like you know sometimes they don't know the strategy they should do or that's not the right word but that is i always i think what if you did
00:08:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, like what if you didn't know, you know, you just keep digging and digging.
00:08:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tell me more. Yeah, tell me more is great.
00:08:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so that's interesting about your background. That is cool. So like, wow, have you thought about with your background then? explains why you're still going to what you do. Have you ever thought about starting your own software type company then?
00:08:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, there's a whole lot of things. This is the thing I've had to learn is that I'm really good at a lot of things, which is because I can doesn't mean I should. I'm working on my psychology degree and it has nothing to do with my business other than people also say, can I need you to be like coach Tina today? And I have an attorney in LA and they do about four million a month. And he says, do you help people find their purpose? I was like, nobody hires me for that, but it's happened accidentally. Yeah, you're talking.
00:08:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
There's a lot of skills that I have, but what I feel called to most.
00:08:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. is being God's love. And there's just not enough, but there's very judgy Christians. There's very, there's just a lot of pain and anger. But are you familiar with the parable of the seed? Not the mustard seed, but the seed that landed in the desert, landed in the rocks, landed in the, and got blown away. Like there's four different places, I think, where the seed landed. when it landed in good soil, that's when it grew and nurtured. And so I don't have to really preach the gospel. I can be God's love. I can be the example so that when the time comes and they get introduced or they're ready to live any kind of way, he won't be strange to them because they will have felt unconditional love. Because, sorry.
00:09:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's okay.
00:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But God's house. to the house of water. I bring order to their business and it comes out in their homes. When I help people install boundaries into their lives, into their business, they install them in their daily lives with their spouses, their kids, with themselves, with their friends, their lives change and they become stronger, they come and more independent, they become better leaders, they become more sovereign beings and to me, that's the kind of people that are God's people. So even if they don't really feel like I still feel like I'm serving Him and giving His love. So there's a lot of different ways we can serve but I feel like my best, like I used to post on social media a lot, the reason I haven't been out is because I really felt like I needed to concentrate and think of like when you get concentrated juice versus when it's watered down. potency is different. so there was a time I felt like I needed to concentrate more on my immediate sphere, on my children, on my sweetheart, on my sisters, on my friends, on the closer people. And I feel like I've been able to serve and strengthen them well enough that now I can go out and increase in my circle of influence. But it is really going to be around strengthening people, helping them become their best selves, become the leaders that they can be in their own spheres of influence. And again, there's lots of ways to do that. But really, it is through teaching people, improved operations that, you know, it starts with business, but it really applies to life and they and they overlap because it's people that run business and people that run their lives. I won't be distracted into any other Shiny object and opportunity because this this is my calling for sure.
00:12:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Cool and it's funny like and I don't know how much work will get done right now this call because we can hook another call right um and don't pay for it. just want to the book. Oh no it's fine. Yeah getting to know each other but that like it's fun you know because we all went through a lot of life stuff over the last few years um when my dad did pass away I like obviously I went on a downward spiral because I was the closest to my dad of all the siblings like and I was the youngest one right so the baby and uh how many siblings do you have?
00:12:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's it? How many siblings do you have?
00:12:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Three.
00:12:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay just wanted to put that in perspective okay.
00:12:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh got you have older sister older into all their older brothers and um I think and I'm the only one that's the entrepreneur the rest are scientists chemists and yeah my sister's a uh doctorate in uh pharmacology toxicology and and she's a cool stuff of children's age research you know. When it. like there's more than 90s and stuff, she's retired now. yeah, the other two are engineers, but so I went the business route. But I think also, because I'm the youngest too, I always I realized after my dad passed away and all this life changes about my own inner work, is that I realized I was doing a lot of things to please my dad. I didn't realize that the laughter. And I also asked my mom a few times because she's very spiritual and I said, know, like, what do we hear for? You know, because it's like, what is this early all about, you know, because that was the first close death to me. And it's an interesting, my mom said, well, it's it's to be God's love, you know, so it's funny what you say, because like, you know, lot of people have different answers, like, why are we here on earth is that? But that's why mom says, it can be that simple, you know, and I'm like, wow, I never thought of it that way. So, so yeah, I'm sure there's a reason you're right. Well, I are process connected. We say, if you're big hug, I'm a big hugger. Oh, thanks. Yeah, yeah, so so I've been having fun the last little bit. I'm helping some people with their their funnels and all that, so. I'm not sure which way you want to go, you know, what do you want to take this call?
00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what I want to know is you had notes. You had notes when we talked to you said you have ideas. I want to hear for those ideas.
00:14:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
will pay to hear those ideas. Oh, OK, I have to go up and get it.
00:14:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's in my I'm downstairs right now. Do you mind?
00:14:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't mind. I'll wait. No, yeah, what I'll do just give me about five minutes because I got to go find the art book. I can't remember whether it's up in my office still or over.
00:14:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have like three places in my home I work from. I am not in in a hurry. My life and my work is so leisurely. Maria and the people that I work with, I choose the same kind of vibe.
00:14:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So whatever it takes. I'll just do some stuff. Yeah, give me about five, seven minutes. I'll actually put the T kettle on too and make a cup of tea. And because I, yeah, like I, it's funny because I'm going to take my mom to the art store again soon, I was like, oh, out of artwork. So I have to find where I put it, because it was once after your meeting, it was full.
00:15:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, so give me five, 10 minutes. I'll be right back.
00:15:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
cool, love it.
00:15:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. You You You
00:22:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You All right, she's getting back. Oh, no, it's keep going. I'll just keep breathing.
00:22:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Keep going. My little FTT month slack. Okay. Yeah, I'm right.
00:23:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Cool. Cool. I brought my iPod down to and connected it and we can even just be drawn as if you need to go to. Yeah, I got this an action. can take a picture of it, send it to a boxer after or, you know, yes, please, ma'am. Yeah, I'll do that.
00:23:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let me go with going people about to telling friends about you about how awesome it was talking to you and what your notes look like when we were done.
00:23:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
like, oh, her brain is different. I want to see it.
00:23:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cool. What's like that?
00:23:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm a weirdo. I love it. love it. Let me. Oh, well, you're going to be able to see the picture. But anyways, there's one picture we didn't I remember from the last call that was the beginning as well. So we thought just doing some the audience building with some quality videos. So this thing I just sent you this on Voxer, like it was kind of the videos you see video one and then V2 for video two. So video one is just about client's day with me for nine years. So I thought that was huge. So I really just took notes of some of the kind of repeatable tuples that you say as well, but it was really too, I don't know like what I did, hey, hey, hey, no, Merlin, no, sorry. doggy. Was that a dog? Yeah, yeah, he's I don't know how well you can see it.
00:24:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There he is. Merlin. Yeah. Oh, he's so cute.
00:25:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's probably getting scared because I think there's a big thunderstorm coming our way. You know, when the heat dropped, the heat got so hot, you know, all that could be storms coming. So yeah, the wind now just picked up and yeah, anyway, yeah. then, so, anyway, so yeah, so the thoughts I had were to just start creating this kind of connection. I don't know if you want to call it a connection connection, social funnel or culture, social funnel, whatever the words out there that people use nowadays. But it's really a bottom line just creating these three to five minute videos. We're just giving good value content with no intent to sell right away, even though obviously that's what we're going to do.
00:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're building up your invisible list, so to say, right?
00:25:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So for example, like me, Karina and I have one video. video where I scripted for her and I said, hey, just do this, like 10 reasons to trust us, right? And she's Shopify certified partner. So she kind of lists 10 reasons to trust her like, hey, I've also built a million dollar business on Shopify, still on the boutique, it's still running, all these things. it's not really like, okay, my stuff. It's more just, hey, here's 10 reasons to trust it and it shows, hey, I don't want my mom, you know, with my husband and kids and stuff. so, but funny enough, that video brings in sales. I was just looking at ads this morning and showed the purchase column and it's like, don't know exactly which thing they purchased because we have a few things. That business model is more like what we call the, do you remember the Sears catalog?
00:26:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yes. Yes, I do.
00:26:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And Avon catalogs.
00:26:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you remember when we opened? I'm also Avon and Tupperware and Mary Kay.
00:26:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes, do. Yeah, so like, there's so many ways, as you know, to build a business that makes sales. But one of the ways that I think is like strong now, um, because of technology and social media reach and adds the way it's beneficial to videos. Anyway, like, you know, we all bought through catalogs when we're younger or my mom too, like she's Avon seller and and and Sears catalog come wait to have it come out and go buy. Do you need the Christmas catalog? Yes. And then I busted my marketing chops going through the JP Peterman catalog before the internet existed. So I would like learn from the direct sales master's back then was like, yeah, yeah, Robert Colier. I used to buy for me, be his antique books used to be a pastor and then became. Oh, wow.
00:27:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I did. I did Don Don happy days.
00:27:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, I'm not Don Tom Bosley's SNC.
00:27:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, okay. Don Don the pre's as like, I did my tone and everything. and Melaleuca and everything and a lot of my friends are in direct response and oh cool one of my clients is Brian Kurtz as partner so I've been working with him for six and a half years and Brian threw that as well so yeah it's it's a small world I was I was going through because I do my research and looked at all of your Facebook profile things because that's what we do it's we suck face images and I saw a picture of you with Seth Laraby. Seth sensed my sweetheart my fiance to go on the internet and be on Facebook and now we've been together for 10 years so oh my god small world how we all interact and impact each other in a professional way but in in a really personal way because I was not looking to date I was I was gone through divorce and he was um well I told God if he wanted me to be
00:29:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
with anybody you'd have to drop them on my lap. So I love it.
00:29:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
love it. Yeah. I was coaching soccer and raising four girls and teaching music in Sunday school and running business. And anyway, but, but yeah, our history is amazing. I was looking at it and I saw something you did saying you've been doing this for two decades. I'm like, I've never met another woman that's been doing this this long. And then the post today about people call you like the mom of their business.
00:29:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, I've never heard anybody else be that, but I've been that for a long time.
00:29:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm like, this is just like, how did it take so long to even know? That's what I'm like.
00:29:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But anyway, that's cool. That's cool. Yeah. Well, actually, when my dad started getting sick about three years ago, I kind of hid for a while. So I wasn't really as much. I was buying the scenes as the chief marketing officer for a couple of companies.
00:29:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, so, so yeah, going back to the catalog model.
00:29:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So yeah, we have a of my business model, because I have a percentage of her company, is more selling all the little things like this for three bucks, this for 20 bucks, this for $30 like a catalog model. So, because once they find one thing, as long as they're good quality products. And of course, you just have some mid ticket, like $500 and $4,800 high ticket. But most of the sales are driven through the low ticket. And the exit strategy, we figure for that in a couple of years is the boutique brain software, AI software that we're going to come out with in about August. But so for you, we don't know what path and since you're so open talking about it's cool, we don't know what path even God's going to have for you. But I know that if we start creating your audience, that's something cool could come or we just stick with what you already are, you know, selling. But the first step is like just spend the first month or two, sort of my cats, stairs, it's a bedroom divergent office.
00:30:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think they're just all going bananas because I'm down.
00:31:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
here.
00:31:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's cuddles, but what's going on?
00:31:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, it's only 334 here and she doesn't get fed to five, but she's acting like it's five. So anyway, so one of the things that we should just do is like just like all these videos, we start creating them and then run $5 day ads to them and to find out which audiences are working and which videos kind of work better and then there's KPIs that come into place.
00:31:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, you know, many people stay watching 25% of the video?
00:31:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What's the cost for 25% of the video? Because like when I first started now with Ginger for about a month, it started about $0.70 to $1 for every 25% video view and different angles like Gary Vannerchuk audience, Marie Forleo, a reporter field, digital marketing, software companies, because she builds websites for people. And So, in her case, after a few weeks, we found some of the better audiences and tweaked some of the videos so that she now has more like under 50 cents video view, which is like almost a hundred percent decrease in her cost of building her video views audience. And when you, Green and I have been doing the video views for over six months, we're now down to some videos are getting like 10 cents per 25 percent video, which is really good. Yeah. every day's for sure. Yeah. Yeah. So every week we can, you know, gain like about 2000 people that and they're not just watching 25 percent of the video view, then percentage of them go on and watch like 75 percent of the three to five minute video, which is priming that person then to whatever, say just to choose a simple model, like let's just open and close, Hey, the higher ticket product three days every month. So So for Kreno, we're opening and closing a thing for $500 for the next three days. because we've built up so much brand equity from the video views and value videos and I don't know the right word for it, it's not culture equity, it's not community equity, maybe it's connection equity, but like silly videos too about like 10 reasons to trust us are a little bit more about you, know, like the client stayed with me for nine years. I don't mean that silly, the word silly is the wrong name for it, but it's like not a typical direct response video where you're teaching here's right for you to double your average order value, which are good videos to have to, business, know how to, but the client's statement for nine years just build a, wow, that's a big deal.
00:33:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, a huge person of why people will say you don't keep talking to anybody that doesn't have a personality.
00:33:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I have personality.
00:33:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It will come out, but if I were just to talk about the business stuff and not show my personality, which means there will be silly videos, sassy videos, things like that. It is for people to stay with you a long time, they have to have relationship. You're not going to have a relationship with anybody that is tedious to listen to. That isn't entertaining to some point, and especially that you don't feel so to feel connected to somebody near a neuron being what they are, you have to feel like they see you. How do I make people feel like they're seen through the video? Well, it is through talking about my stories, and I know you've experienced something like this, not this, and the language, the nuance of the language is really important. I have a client, I keep brow beating him with these like, nobody's doing this, nobody's ever seen this. I'm like, you're wrong about that. You haven't seen anybody else doing it, but to be so arrogant as to think that you're eight figure and I'm for your clients. I've never seen anybody do this. They're playing in a different pool than you are. First of all, they're all over the world. And I know people who are doing what you're doing. They're just not broadcasting it. They're secret weapons working silently behind the scenes. But what I'm going to tell you is the one day that somebody besides me tells you, you're not the only one doing this, like it's going to hit his ego really hard. And it's just just being mindful. Like you don't have the Lord over people. Because you know you have a powerful, potent skill. I am incredibly rare. Few people can do what I can do. But I also know there are a lot of people who can do things I can't do. I am cut off at the knees if I have to do everything by myself. Some things I can do by myself which makes me powerful. Yeah. Building my own business, I cannot do by myself because I will lose. I am a social creature. I draw energy from other people. So in serving other clients, there's always other people, but I can't do that for myself. So what good does it do to be great at business if I can't do it for myself, by myself, right?
00:36:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I need people.
00:36:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And anyway, making videos and helping people see one of my, I think special talents is, and I get this from a lot of people is they'll have something in their brain for a really long time. But because they've never spoken in, and a lot of times even they've tried to, and they don't know how to, but somehow I'm able to find the words and it's usually a story or an analogy and say, it's like this, where they're like, I've never heard it put into words. And sometimes it's years that they've never heard the words spoken, they've never heard articulated, which means they've never understood it themselves, and or felt understood by somebody else. And so what I found in my years on Facebook, which has brought me all the business I could handle up till now is that even in my posting, just written text, people feel that, people feel connected to me, people will tell me a post of mind changed their lives. I have people that are making videos that have huge followings that never made a video until I did a video challenge about 11 years ago, and they made their first videos. now video is their life and their TikTok and Instagram and YouTube stuff. And I just think, I don't know how a big ego about it, but I wonder how much I showed up and people were following me and they had been following me, but silently, we weren't connected, but now I've had people send me jewelry that they made. one girl sent me a shirt that said, Team Tina on it. And I just post a little bit of stuff, so I know that. I do know how to connect with people and to the we don't know what God is going to call me to. I don't care what works or how it works. I care that I work, meaning that I shoulder to the wheel elbow grease work. Yeah, I mean, what comes out of it is always enough. I always have what I need as always taken care of. I've been poor, I've been rich, I've been everything in between and that doesn't matter. What matters is that that I'm doing the work, so I don't have a lot of attachment between the work very easy to do because the goal is serve people and I'm taking care of. It's always been like that. God has made it that way. If I will go where he wants me to go then he will. So in terms of like these videos, the picture that you sent me. these are things that I feel so okay. In terms of like what I could get from help with you and it's. also crazy too that at the same time as I found you and I'm like I really want to talk to this lady because you stand out and all the ways I told you you did. I've got these old clients that want to do work and it's a husband and wife team and their kids have watched them grow up and we work together for you here and she wants to do this because I had put together your hosting can I share my screen? Yeah absolutely and I'm just going to the the TV automatically went on down there I'm just going to go turn it off hold on just let's see you
00:40:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, back back back, here we go.
00:40:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I showed her this yesterday, whoops, apparently I'm on my keyboard. That was like this, I'm not greedy. I want to work on a profit sharing model. I mean, not just that, I'm willing to pay base pay because I'm all pizza, I get paid plus rev share. But there's also, so there's a couple things like, for example, my fiance is very wealthy, but I, I keep a very independent work of my business and the biggest reason is because I want to be able to show women what's possible when they're doing it on their own.
00:41:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And that's been a huge thing before we get married. I'm like, I need to have accomplished a certain amount of things, not pride, it's not ego, it's evidence based.
00:41:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
People listen to the people that they feel like understand and have gone through things because I've gone through a lot as a single mom. And because one of the the biggest ways to convince someone is to be like, I've done it. Yeah. So to kind of take the excuses away. Anyway, but the other thing is like, you know, in the men's world, they're ref sharing partnering, helping each other make money all the time. women are just paid. can't tell you how many millionaires I've made, Maria. Yes, I know. Well, going bankrupt, by the way, I fired a client when I had no other income.
00:42:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It was, they built something called Coffee Shop Millionaire, this dude named Anthony Trister.
00:42:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, it took them two and a half years to make a product and launch it.
00:42:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
When they launched it, it's made $80,000 like in a couple of weeks, but then it goes out to $3,500 a month on ClickPink.
00:42:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so they did that two months in a row, they're like this sucks. And his partner's name was Manish. Well, I met Manish through Eric Luvier and job crusher. And because I was working on job crushers payroll for a while, right around divorce, transition time. And Manisha, hey, can you help with some tech stuff? Because I can do all this technical development. I made my bread and butter customizing WordPress themes for a while. Like I can do the copy.
00:42:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I can do the graphics. can do everything.
00:42:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Anyway, Um, so I came in there to help them with some, some tech stuff, some automations, but they had a developer. And the biggest thing that they did was they had created this. It was, you know, make money online activity coffee shop millionaire. He was not a millionaire. So there's integrity issues already.
00:43:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, and what Anthony did was just went around and hustled.
00:43:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He was in the affiliate market and the, you know, the mastermind circuit, all that stuff. Well, by the third month of $3,500, they had asked me, would you be our business manager?
00:43:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because I would ask them questions. are you doing this? Why are you doing that? Why are doing this? Yeah.
00:43:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Finally, um, four months into working for them. So I started in March, which by the way, this is how God is. I had zero clients. I had taken my girls into homeschool because my ex was abusive.
00:43:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I was like, if you're going to get bullied at home, you're not going to get bullied at school.
00:43:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Also, I can't at least keep you here. can watch you more. So I hadn't taken any clients. for a while. So I had no money. A week after I left, I got this job and was on payroll and was able to take care of my family. So God is so good. Anyway, this is all relative to what's happening. So this is my first time making a million dollar company in less than a year. And so took the two and a half years to make it, did their launch 3,500 a month for a few months. And then I'm like, why am I even your business manager? You should go find somebody else because you don't listen to me. You don't do any of things I tell you. You have the same conversations week after week after week and I wrote money. They get paid to hear this stupidity all the time and be forced to listen to this. I have to take care of kids.
00:44:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't want to do it in business too.
00:44:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they're like, fine, we will do what you say. Eight months after I started working with them, they had three other products on the market and they had broken a million dollars in sales. That was not them. partially for sure. But they were spending their rills. They didn't know how to do it. And then, are you familiar with Ryan Moran?
00:45:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:45:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, he wrote a book last year, I think, called 12 Months to a Million Dollars. It was about a company called St. Labs that I helped him build as his business manager. So they were already doing pretty well. But when I came in and I have a testimonial from his partner, I helped them 400 times what they were doing.
00:45:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. No, I remember you were mentioning that.
00:45:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was like, yeah. So and all it was better meetings and whatnot. But anyway, those people will profit share profit share.
00:45:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They were paying me $15 an hour, Maria. Yeah. That's the hour.
00:45:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. Yeah. And so then I was like, I'm no, not going to do this. Okay. So I had to do this whole quitting thing, big drama.
00:45:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They came up, okay, well, we'll you $40 an hour.
00:45:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So within a few months, I was getting paid $500 an hour, but not for from them. And then Ryan called and offered me to one third of his company, if I would come down to Austin and run it for him. He said, everybody's got their prize, Tina.
00:46:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, you can't pay my Ryan.
00:46:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't hate men by any means, bags, and they can be nail and female.
00:46:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And there's lots of I agree, I just don't want to work with them.
00:46:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, so you may or may not have any interest in this. Shando did. And she's like, I will, I will do this. This is not ownership, but it's profit sharing. I want to be able to own my content and what I create because this is my two decades of experience and things. But, and I don't know if you would have any interest in it. I, there's definitely an overlap, but there also could be multiple marketing efforts coming because I create content and you two have very different personalities. And maybe I wait and see what happens with her and if it doesn't work out see if you want to I don't know that sounds kind of do She to me, but I'm also just a Throw everything out.
00:47:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I bomb it and see what happened. Oh, yeah I mean never know until you start working with someone, you know Yeah, we want to go what would the topic of this be this product?
00:47:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So this is So I have a I've put together a We'll call it an e-book right now. It's ultimately going to be on it. I think it's a crap I think it's gonna take a long time No, that's not it. Hold on sec There's my VSL from like 12 years ago for a product I mean I called my freedom systems 20 minute VSL because that was the thing and they worked Yeah, yeah, it was crazy. Um, let me which accounts my Sorry So, so first of all, there's some, these could be trip wires, they could be free. I could do, I've got like nine different things. I think the ones that are the most powerful would be simple finance systems. This is, these are all first draft, but transform your business finances. Actually, you know what, let's go to the time one. I'll show you the time one, because I had people do you know who Tyler Ellison is?
00:48:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, probably if I saw him, I might recognize some of the stuff because he is a media buyer.
00:49:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And, matter of fact, he was the media buyer for sheer strength labs when it got started. That's Ty.
00:49:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We're cool.
00:49:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And he, he's been doing stuff with the Annalene anyway, he bought my program 12 years ago and said that this time sheet homework was worth the $97 out by itself. And I had a lot of people go through it, let me see, open it up real quick. But, and I won't say nobody else does this, but this is definitely not a, everyone does this kind of thing. few people do it. So I have three primary, well, four primary principles, I would say, hold on, principles and priorities, finance, time tracking, let's see those three. The first thing is just teaching people about principles and priorities. And the reason is one of the biggest issues that people have is that in the same reason that we have people showing up to meetings and you're talking about the same thing and it didn't get done. Why didn't get done? Were you not working? Of course not. Of course I wasn't not working. I did this instead. I did this and said, well, why did you not do the thing? Because it wasn't a clear enough priority to me that I knew that that was what I had to be working on. And the reason that is is because we didn't establish values. So even when you're one person working in your own business, a lot of times people just sit. All right. What do I do today? do I need to work on? Well, if you have established that you need to work on X because X is going to give you this and Y and Z can't really be done well until X is done. Then you're very clear that X has to be done because it is, it's the cornerstone. own of everything else that you're doing. But you don't know that unless you've asked yourself what matters. Well what matters. And then you get into and almost all the time people can't tell me what does matter. What they can tell me is what they don't want. They can tell me I don't want to work after six o'clock. I don't want to deal with bad clients. I don't want to do my taxes.
00:51:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't want to do you know what I mean?
00:51:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's like types of activities, types of people, amounts of times and how much money they want to get paid.
00:51:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Those are some very clear I don't want this.
00:51:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But they can tell me what they don't want clearly without being able to confidently say but I do like people can tell me I don't want to work past three o'clock but they don't want to say I want to be done working by three. only want to work six hours a day. It's this weird thing it's almost like they haven't given themselves permission yet. So I removed that. They don't even know I've removed it. They don't care that I removed it because I'm me them say it in a way that didn't scare them by saying, I don't want this because they're good at saying what they don't want. Anyway, all of that can be done in a little product, a little seven dollar product, $20, whatever product. When they've determined that, but sometimes they can't determine that. So sometimes we have to mix it with this activity. And this is the thing that has brought people hundreds of thousands of dollars just by going through this because it's a mindset shift. So when you figure out your mostly profitable activity, I had a real estate agent, he went through this, he's like, holy crap, I'm spending my time doing whatever kind of basic stuff when really my money making comes from showing houses. So I need to get this stuff off my plate. I sometimes people just don't ask themselves what's their most profitable activity. Most people, ask themselves what their most profitable activity is. Then you think about what's the other stuff because you have to know what's there. And then when we get to the time sheet exercise, I'm going to wrap this up really fast because I'm sure you probably have another call. Time sheet exercise, a lot of times people will under predict how long it'll take. Well, it's only going to take me half an hour to write this copy. Yeah, plus six hours, something like that. You know, people tend to underestimate.
00:53:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So once we start talking, I try to do that all the time. Yes.
00:53:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So but once you start to be more mindful of it, you start to be able to better engage and then you give yourself a little break and go, Oh, the reason I didn't get this done is because it takes longer than I thought it did. Yeah. So then you start to give yourself some grace and time things better. So but then a lot of times they'll plan out their work week, but they won't take into account that is gym night. Well, for me, when I go to the gym, the next day I am diminished. I don't have as much strength. and energy. I'm tired. I need like 10 hours of sleep that night instead of eight. I'm going to eat more the next day because I've left heavy weights. And so the day after needs to be calculating what's happening that day, people don't do that generally speaking. so they're just like, I'm dragging what orchestrate a day that is compatible with the activity of going to the gym the night before. Date night, a lot of times we'll energize people if they have you know, a good experience with it. And so I talk about energy sandwiches. If there's something that really sucks in your life and you have to do it, sandwich it in between the really good stuff. Yeah, yeah. So anyway, these are things that and I bought another hour so we could schedule that another time and go through it because at the very least, I would love to have your mind just say, this is what I think that you should do. This is where I think you stand out.
00:55:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's part of why.
00:55:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm talking so much because you have experience so you could say, Tina, I've never heard this where I rarely hear this. We need more of this in the world.
00:55:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think if you say that to me, I'm going to trust your expertise because you've been around a long time.
00:55:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I benefit from you specifically because of that. So my, I'll tell you all my modules if I can get to my chapters. So principles priorities start by defining what matters most.
00:55:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Simple finance systems, what comes in, or it needs to be greater than what goes out.
00:55:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Time mastery, making the most out of the hours you have, things like that. Business and project management, it's the same thing. It's teaching people the simplest, but as you can see, they build upon each other. Knowing what you want to earn and how much you want to earn starts and works best when you have your priorities and your values. Because so many people are like, I'm going to earn a million dollars by that. Why? Well, so and so did. And I'm like them. Yeah. Like, well, that's, you know, that's not gonna make you happy. Anyway, dream team, people want to hire when they have no business hiring, when they have no skill about delegating, when they don't know how to train, when they don't even know how to hire. And they want to go spend $3,000 a month when they're making $10,000 a month to hire somebody.
00:56:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't know how to lead.
00:56:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So a whole long conversation about before you do this. Here's how you do this optimally to get your money back and to increase your energy, not just your revenue, by who you bring on to your team. Optimizing iteration, scaling, which is not the same optimized, obviously is making it work the best you can scaling it is growing what's already working good. And this, I don't really hear people talking about this but sharpening your saw, whatever you're good at, keep getting good at it, keep getting better at it. They're one of the reasons I never lose clients. I won't say never lose clients, but I have it. I fired them. They haven't fired me is because when I feel a lull and they're showing up and we're having the same conversation and there's no excitement and they're like, yeah, everything's okay or everything's good. But they're not like, oh, great idea, Tina. But they don't say that to me for a little while.
00:57:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I need to go have something better for the table.
00:57:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But also I become happier because I'm investing in myself and I'm learning more like working on my psychology degree so I can understand how the brains work better and how my people work better and things like that, including my own children, finding your heart. We lose people, we lose pets, we lose spouses, we lose parents, we lose kids. If we don't fortify our brains and our hearts and our spirits, like filling them up with good books, good stories, good understanding. underdog stories, especially things like that, then when things go bad, we don't have anything in the tank to go and help us through this. But it's inevitable that a human will go through this. That human that's running a business is going to take their business with it. And all the people that rely on them and work for them and the families that rely on their parents who work there. So I just want to fortify the people that lead and the businesses that they lead. And this is what I'm doing. But all of this is segmentable and iteratable, which means there is a tiny portion that I can give away, a tiny portion I could sell at the next level. There is an ascension in all of these. How a person who's making zero money applies this is going to be different than how a person who's making $10 million a year applies this. It's going to be different than how somebody making $100 million a year applies this. But all of these principles will apply.
00:59:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Does that make sense? It does, it does.
00:59:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, like, how does this work? There is a personal story in anecdote several and infinite really for all of these in terms of stories content creation of my own of other people calling in other creators and collaborating with them. This is a this is a community thing like we all need these things we all have had these issues and nobody is ever mastering all these things at all times. No. So, this is timeless. I'm not the expert in all of it, but what I bring to the table is the depth of the conversation so that you and your own skill and your own talent and you talking about these things with the brains around you and the hearts around you are going to be better and going to be four to five for your whatever investment in this is going to pay you back over and over again. I'm confident about that.
01:00:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What's the example Jack's 90-day plan?
01:00:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Whoa, where are we at?
01:00:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, on the left-hand side, I'm looking in the table of contents, yeah.
01:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's realigning his actions with his vision values. Jack set a goal to increase his digital marketing agency's client by 15% over the next 90 days. Using the smart framework, Jack made his goal specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound. He then created a 90-day plan to break this goal into actionable steps, so I actually have like a 90-day roadmap of these are the things that we're going to do. But they're not, that is a pace, and it wasn't actually Jack, it was Dan, between you and me. But the pace is very specific to the person and what happens most of the time, is people get overzealous in the pace, and they're mad that they don't get there, and then they feel like they feel feel feel. And worse, they feel like their team has failed, and then whole thing. Dan is very laid back, so this is much slower. This tends to happen over a year, but we did create the 90-day roadmap, kind of working off of Aaron Fletcher's stuff, but it was already things that we were doing. He's like, Tina, you already have this.
01:01:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You already have this.
01:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, But we don't have it written down. Anyway, Dan is one of my biggest fans who's never made a testimony.
01:01:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's like, I'm not that dude. I'm like, I know it's okay. I was just curious, it's kind of a big deal, too, the 90-day goal setting, creating a 90-day plan. 90. And the other thing that intrigued me is the scaling your business is hot, as you know right now. Hot trend, hot words over productivity, but the productivity time is powerful, but often is the vitamin that you put into the program, and I know you know these things, but... Yeah.
01:02:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm-hmm. Sell them what they want.
01:02:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Give them what they need. Yeah.
01:02:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
them painkillers because that's what they want.
01:02:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Give them vitamins. Yeah. So, yeah, cause I know a friend of mine just bought someone's course and she's going to stop the monthly because it was like no contracts. It was like 300 bucks a month. But she's intrigued by it because the promise was, you know, get a hundred K months. Line with your heart and stuff. But once you got in, she kind of, cause she's already, already wasn't Taki Moore's black belt program. I'll go because a lot of it was all just that. But the interesting part is that he sold her what she wanted. The hundred K and result goal. But once you got in, a lot of it was, which is just important, but she already knew it. As a line in your, your business around the life that you want, run your values so that you don't create a monster of a business that you want out of. That's all synopsis, right? But he led with the hundred K months, but. Yeah. once the 90 day roadmap or something that's always really hot even when I do surveys to people.
01:03:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes so this this the thing is I usually custom customize this them for people and the other biggest problem is that usually this 30 days ends up being 90 days this 30 days ends up being 90 days this 30 days ends up being it depends on the person and how much they show up but generally really there's a whole lot of resistance that happens in here a whole lot of um executive dysfunction yeah I know I need to define this I know I need to crunch the numbers I know I need to ask myself these questions but what happens is is they think about everything that's attached to that question of why am I here after I've been doing this for 10 years they start asking themselves other questions which overwhelm them depress them cause them anxiety and make them want to bury their heads so they do don't do this until they get back on the call and I drag it out of them on a call which is one of the reasons a lot of this stuff doesn't work without coaching because the thing that's stopping you is your own mental stuff and there's nobody there to extract you from your stuff and your stuff from you. It's a huge part of the work and if somebody doesn't have the mental fortitude to do that on their own they're going to continue to spin their wheels until they get somebody to help them. Yeah. That's what's hard and nobody wants to hear that but there's enough people I can sell this to who have been doing this enough that they know that they're in their own way. Yeah. And that they know there is no diet pill that actually will give you the body that you want. Yeah. have to do diet, you have to do exercise. I only want to talk to people who are not trying to buy lottery tickets.
01:05:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
diet pills anymore. There's a lot of tickets and diet pills. You haven't got where you need to be to talk to me. I've already got them for you as well.
01:05:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I stay it all the time.
01:05:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. I get some diet.
01:05:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, right? You want the easy way to riches, you want the easy way to health and it doesn't exist. Now, there is an optimized way, there's a leveraged way, but there is not an easy way. Simple, not easy.
01:05:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
How does this phrase resonate with you?
01:05:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Leveraged I recall it leveraged abundance because riches to me puts a very specific connotation of money. I also don't want to deal with FTC, but abundance is a whole different kind of thing. When I think about even the. for I had a lot of money, I had a lot of wealth, the kind of freedom I had over my life and the relationships I had with my kids, with myself, with God, with my, that was, that was exceptional, even then. It led to the money. So leveraged, leveraged abundance or leveraged wealth, even.
01:06:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But yeah, I like abundance. I like wealth. Don't get me wrong, but there's already, I'm trying to sort of kind of also as you're talking, think of how you can be a category of one as well, like from a branding perspective. Yeah, because in these videos too, like, like typically after the I've been, you know, I've helped create, you know, multi-million dollar companies or sold company in 18 months for a million dollars. Like, I'd say some accolades, right and for you and then you can create.
01:07:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think I can help you with this. I don't know anyone else that was a single mom of four kids who works less than 20 hours a week making six figures growing million dollar businesses for my clients and still having time to coach soccer. I've never met anybody else that could do that.
01:07:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So so so you're you're yeah like you could be known as that I like that yeah that would be it and then also maybe like you're you're known as like leveraged abundance is sort of the portfolio of products that you have or something. I was just trying to think of it.
01:07:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Abundance has its connotation to you. It is what my stressed out anymore. I had one question. client who showed up and he went to all these masterminds and he spent so much money. And he's he's in the guru network. And he's like, I always show up to calls ready to be beat up and I'm intimidated and I'm anxious. And he says, I just feel you love love. Now I beat him up. Yeah, beat him up. I called him out every time I said that , you shouldn't do this that you should not be doing that. No, you should do not. He's like that hurts. He goes but I still feel love and I feel anxious. And and he had peace and he told me that I made him a better father and a better husband.
01:08:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But I was here for work in business.
01:08:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And there's video on my wall somewhere about it that that he left me. And and when my dad's are like, I'm picking up my kids and I'm taking naps and I'm less it's less stress. They're happier. They're less stressful. They're busy. this are growing, I really have, know, people will say, double your income, cut your time in half. I've done that with people over and over again, but that's not the best part. The best part is they were happier, they were less stressed, they liked who they were working with. And so the thing that I tell people is, where do I have it? But it's, I have to sustainable growth and the business that you love. Where the heck? I have an Etsy store too, so I'm good. That's my fun thing. That'll do it right there, I think. Maximized profits, streamline operations, love your business. That's the big thing right there. Whoa, not going to be happy. If you're stressed, you're not going to be happy. If you're broke, you're not going to be happy. If you're hustling and grinding and chasing everything, you can't be unless you're leveraged and optimized. You're not going to love your business. Most people don't love their business. I do.
01:10:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would do this for free if I didn't need money.
01:10:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I still do it. I've done it. I do it for free.
01:10:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've got clients I work for for free.
01:10:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, that I've worked with for over a year, because that's how much I love what I do. And that's also very unique. Not a lot of people can say that.
01:10:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
01:10:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, I don't know what the hook is. I've never known what it is. So many times people try to tell me, ask me, Tina, tell me what you do. I'm like, I do so many different things. It's really more relative to you, which is not a great answer. So to tell you what I have to do, I have to know what you do.
01:10:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I could tell you what it would be helpful, blah, blah, blah, blah, Got you, got you, got you. That's where I started. I go, Maria, no, but I do like all the thoughts, leverage and optimize happy leaders, double your income time and half. Yeah, because, because when you show me that spreadsheet earlier, like the, the other one with the financial performance and stuff, seven dollar to a Facebook ads, like a productivity kind of product working that well, you know, unless I'm just having to.
01:11:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't really think Facebook is the place for me. think you too. And talk would probably be ideal. And I think that whatever I do on one, I'll duplicate on the other, maybe with a tiny tweak, according to that platform and probably Instagram because they're very similar. But my priority would be to talk in YouTube because I think that they have the most leverage compensation opportunity. I think that my personality will do very well on both of those platforms to get people to help me come out of my shell enough to do it. I've really struggled with that because I'm making claims and I am very private and YouTube is not private.
01:12:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All your neighbors see everything.
01:12:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This has been a very separate world from the rest of my life. Nobody knows what I do. There's been a lot of resistance to that, but anyway, I think YouTube and TikTok have a lot of these types of things, actually, and I think that they could do very well. I think at least the first two could do really well. I think the group membership from what I've been seeing, I don't know about that price point, but the great thing is about this, so suggest change to something and let me show you, it's a formula.
01:13:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Our offer, we've been doing really well with filling out $3, and then you'll end up getting 20% conversion rate. It's a change of $3 to $20, which is insane.
01:13:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so look how fast that changed, but let's reduce these then. Let's change this to $67, instead of $9.97, and that's still a very healthy margin. And let's just say nobody bought that.
01:13:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And the 20 should become 17 if that were to be an order bump, because we've tested 19, 20 versus 17, 17, magic number. think it's because 17 plus three is 20. So when people see that, they're okay with 20, but they're not okay with 22. That's weird.
01:13:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I think groups do better when there's a ton of people in there. And if I have to hire help, I'm really good at hiring. I have a whole huge talent pool I could tap into, and if it's making that amount of money, I get multiple people. to come in and help because a huge part of what I want to do, Mariette, give more jobs.
01:14:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I want to be a job creator for women.
01:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anything else that you would play around with in here?
01:14:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So the book, Digital PDF, that is $20 price per unit.
01:14:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Change that to $17.
01:14:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then is that going to be like an order bump in a funnel?
01:14:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that what your vision is? go ahead.
01:14:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Change the conversion rate from 17% to 45%. That's what we're getting right now in our $3 funnel. Conversion rate on the three buck offers between 20 and 30%.
01:14:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm being conservative. How many eyeballs are you getting on these offers?
01:14:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let me share a screen.
01:14:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, you OK?
01:15:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Questions? Yeah. Because we're using with like Facebook ads, so it's often hard to scale. Do you follow Maria Wentz stuff, by the way?
01:15:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like I know the name.
01:15:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, she says a lot of low ticket stuff, having the catalog model, right? Seers catalog game on catalog, you know? But she came up with this. I'm not buying it, but I always see what people are offering and the business coach on Demento, but it's all sheets, level one, level two. What custom business advice on what you should be doing based on what you want. Here's your input, calculate your monthly sales goal, cost the business coach on the mail, spit out custom checklists for you. Like I was like, holy cow. And then she's linking, I think, to the actual thing. she's charged with January seven, but again, I'm not going to buy, I'm just curious. She's always launching some interesting thing, but see level one, getting your first 1k, level two, your first 5k.
01:15:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
thought that was brilliant. I've never seen anyone do that. Yeah.
01:15:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've not seen that either. Yeah, I'll show you the link and it's funny because. years ago, I was thinking of, oh, you know, when someone buys our product, I should have three different levels that, okay, level one, go here to this training level two, but yeah, and that's something I've been trying to figure out, like, how do I segment because all of these are universal for everybody, but they are applied differently when you're in a different place. Yeah, yeah, I love that. So there, so I just I just shot that over to you there in the zoom chat, but yeah, let me log in to click funnels. So because I want to bring up the stats specifically for the three dollar thing. Now our account will never show the stats for the high ticket stuff or 500 stuff because that's through directly through Stripe. And so, whoops, well, I'll drop sets there so you can see here as well. Okay, slow to me. comes up and okay so let's we're just gonna go just go back here for example my filter so that's going take a while so let me just pull up another click button let me pull up the the thing we just launched last week and we're slowly scaling it this is the three-dollar one that surprised us because we're getting like like crazy um conversions on it remember 29 I can't remember whether we launched it on the 28th front after the 30th so I'll just go here my filter so this one's now so this we're going to push the system i.o. maybe because click panels keeps Come here. So, well, I'll just show this to you. So, this is just like a week or like maybe six days of running some ads. And again, it's not including if they buy the $500 thing or they call them by 4,800 high ticket thing. But anyways, this is showing 275 unique people coming to the page. So, I know it's not a lot right now. It's been running for like six days. The option rate click phones is showing clearly wrong stats because I can't believe it up 92%. But we were running at 80%, which was crazy. That's like the initiate checkout. Because again, it's only $3.
01:18:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:18:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
what's is that 73 people bought. So 73 divided by like say take the 229 number, it's showing 31%. So that's insane because when I come over here. And gosh, I wish I could just pull up a whole years here because I'll show you over 100 grand from the this funnel, and again, not including the $4,800 group coaching up sale. Let's just go to April, because to go order magnitude, this will only convert in as $20 the front end. It will only convert at 3%, you know, something around there. Come on, when it's not pre-framed with the $3 offer, like when it's the front end or what? Yeah, is a different funnel that's $2, and this is the funnel, and I'll show you what it looks like online. There we go. So this is the $3 one here. So all it is is just a simple three-minute video, simple headline, a slow headline. This one little testimonial reel, two minutes of just variety of testimonials. Oh. Just ahead. So yeah, um, and then this like We're going back to really because everyone's attention is like pulled in different directions This is like what's converting well now because you see the numbers just initial this is cool traffic. isn't warm traffic Um, so it's insane. That's everything we're buying. So we are now just playing around with the order bump so 38 of bought the order bump which was 19 we brought it down to 17. So we're having better conversions when it's 17 And then these conversions are not bad So we're happy with this even though the average order value kind of sucks when you Sort of look at it But knowing that we have a $500 thing and a $4,800 thing that we sell them within 30 days that customers Average order value blended will be a lot higher So if I just have a different idea and it I know i'm interrupting I'm going for 80d rain.
01:20:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will I've been trying I'm to hold it for a long time, like a whole 60 seconds.
01:21:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's a really long time for my brain.
01:21:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, I am annoying because this is, I'm a five-year-old in a lot of ways. I am like the kid on the playground that goes, do you want to be my friend? And like, do you want to come play with me? Um, I've never met anybody like you.
01:21:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah.
01:21:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to play with you.
01:21:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like, what if we created something together and combined our skills and knowledge and expertise?
01:21:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I don't know this thing because this wants to be worth out of me. It doesn't matter if it's a parallel and it doesn't matter if they're very similar.
01:21:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't believe in their competing because I think that the people that would be drawn to my individual energy are not the same that would be drawn to our combined energy.
01:21:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And even if they are, also, I just don't believe in competition. I don't believe that it's harmful.
01:21:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I believe in abundance.
01:21:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I believe that. the more effort we put in, the more magic we make, the more magic we use to do things in the world. But what if we just combined things and created something together, we could split the work, it could be a partnership. I don't know you. That's not appropriate.
01:22:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's not wise business.
01:22:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I just feel something very kismet, very sadistic about this. I'm getting very emotional. I really get frustrated at that. But what if you just sit and just think about that? mean, I've got another hour that we can come back, well, half an hour because I respect your time, and we've gone over.
01:22:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
took about 10 minutes making my tea and get my book, so don't worry. We'll just do another hour. the answer straight up is, yeah, I would like to seriously consider that because I think it would be fun, first of all.
01:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need fun and I need more conversations Maria and I need more women. I don't not have them. It's just not enough. Like I am trying to really fill myself up but also I'm trying to fill up other women too. Yeah. the more that you talk the more I'm just like, I, I bore you already.
01:23:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love you already.
01:23:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm just okay.
01:23:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, just real quick, just to kind of like close one. No, no, no, it's okay. So, so you can see from this, like the average hour, this is the one that starts at $20. This one only has a 2.73% conversion rate. So, but the average car value is 104. Like we have that dialed in. But this one, once we can dial it in because it's only been working for a week now. Like this is just the last two days. you can see that we've already dialed in like like the order bump is 27%. We're like a little bit higher. But but still like it's a crazy bananas conversion.
01:24:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like 32%.
01:24:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, you know, but but because the convergence so much higher, the cost per purchase on Facebook is 15 bucks. So we're breaking even the first two days, we actually made bunch of money, but I think warm traffic was there. And that's why a lot of them were buying all these upsells, downsells. But it was crazy. But anyway, to make a long story short, yeah, I think whatever the thing is that we create together, we create we charge three bucks, make a $17 order bump, and then just figure out, you know, what, what the, you know, other things we sell them to make it profitable.
01:24:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. And the other thing is that you're already showing up, you're doing the video, you're talking. The thing that I'm lacking most is the conversations in my life. And is that I don't want to sound arrogant because I actually get very cringy about this. But I can't tell you how many people were like, you should write a book, you should have a podcast, you should be on video, people need more.
01:25:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
for you.
01:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could listen to you read the phone book. It's the weirdest thing.
01:25:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know.
01:25:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
get people are drawn to me. But I in it. But I get fed from them. It's not a I gotta give everything to the world. Yeah, I need that. I can't pour from an empty cup and I'm doing a lot of pouring. And I need to be filled up. But I get filled up by serving. And I think that your personality plus your brains plus your work plus your skills would be amazing. And I think I could match you and I bet you're not matched very often.
01:25:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No. Yeah, yeah, I think I think the match was and he sort of had heart condition. So we aren't able to do a lot of stuff with us. Seven years was Carlos Navarro. He was the guy that's the chief technology officer he was for Nobel Networks. He was one of the original guys there.
01:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you may have heard his name before, but he's brilliant tech or known him and friends with them. But I haven't seen him for
01:26:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Exactly, yeah, he went he they almost recruited me, but I didn't want to move to South Korea The emotional intelligence software that we created about more than 12 years ago and Google's Eric Schmidt chairman of Google invested in it We sold that off to a Korean company that is now using it in hospitals for dementia patients And he became the CTO and moved to Korea and that was about five seven years ago because they wanted to recruit me too But I said no, I can't leave my family my parents and stuff But he didn't have serious heart issues, so he's really just Moved away from from being public the last year went back in health and he now is a little bit more in public, but yeah, he Yeah, so anyway, but yeah, that's only one match with but on that note, you're right I do have 430 call though now, but yeah, you have the link right just book again with me and yes We'll go You

Oh, that's not good sound. Hello. Can you hear me?
00:00:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I heard that.
00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was really garbled.
00:00:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Don't give me that crap.
00:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's what it is, Dan. I can't help it. Are you there?
00:00:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
About now. I think it's because I was on Wi-Fi and data.
00:00:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can hear you. It's still a way. Not great sound quality, but anyway. I had to do this real quick. How, what happens, I mean, unless it's personal and stuffs Monday, that you couldn't come to our meeting?
00:01:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, I hired this dog trainer that Glenn recommended, because it's like completely transformed Glenn's dog, blah, blah, blah, long story short, the guy basically kidnapped the dog. So, I had to go to Phoenix to get the dog back, because his life fell apart. He had no car, he was homeless, he had no car, he's got some crazy girlfriend, she kicked him out. The girlfriend started sending me all these weird messages, and I'm like, is going on? He was supposed to bring back the dog on Tuesday, and he's like, I can't do it. like, oh, got to be kidding me. Nice. So, I had to fly to Phoenix and drive back to get Zinnia, and she's now trying. Right.
00:02:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
As far as I can tell, I just that's terrible.
00:02:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And so you and Glenn are talking again, friends or like, no, he, well, I mean, I do talk to him here and there, but you not me, Tina, I don't do emotional . So he had recommended the guy back in the fall and I talked to the dude briefly and then I just sort of blew it off. But then I was like, right, we get this other dog, like she really needs to like, I just need her to like, get a catch up. Right. So I'm like, can't train two dogs at once, but I'm gonna have to know. And the dude has like great reviews. I guess Glenn never told me this. Glenn told me this recently. the reason when I had like two trainers and neither one of them could really train Malu, which is his German Shepherd. And then Malu was like really fear aggressive. And he was also just sort of not, he was like, unwieldy. And then Malu bit Glenn's mother, she had to go to the hospital get an operation, like, and then that really freaked Glenn out. He's like, wouldn't they wouldn't let anyone come to their house. The dog got worse. So then he found this dude. And now the dog is like, it's a different dog. It's like the dog's like, everyone comes over, we go on walks, no, no more fear aggression. You got to go to the other. And I was like, Oh, yeah, there you go. And then Glenn sound like, other people to the guy. They all raving reviews. They're like, Oh, this guy's great. And then his online reviews are like five stars. So it's like, All right, don't mistake it.
00:04:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, that's wild.
00:04:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
wild. It was unfolding. I'm like, what?
00:04:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now I'm wondering, did your psychic tell you any of this was going to happen? Like not specifically, right?
00:04:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But it was this wild. I don't know.
00:04:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What a story.
00:04:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No.
00:04:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how much, how has been getting her and.
00:04:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it was like four grand to, like, I, when it's all said no, I'm like, but I, he had videos of her and she'd be doing all the things. So I'm like, all right, she is sort of and then he's like, the dude is very apologetic. I mean, I think he just didn't see it, but I'm like, best intentions, bro. it's like they don't mean a whole lot so I'm supposed that he's supposed to like do video call on Friday I'm like this is all for Denise this is not for me it's for her but but yeah so I saw videos of her like healing like a pro right next to him to do that with me so there's still a chance I did some stuff I was doing but the whole rigmarole of flying dude there and driving back yeah but that she doesn't bother me alright whatever that's what I gotta do I'll go do that I mean yeah that's you you choose how you handle things yeah yeah Eric was like I would be so pissed I'm like what's the point what it
00:06:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
point of being mad really about anything?
00:06:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
that's like, and then I wrote some really great lyrics on the ride home. So there you go. I was looking at them this this morning and then someone sent Dan Burks and a new song and I was like, oh, I think those are going to work. Here we go. So there you go.
00:06:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we're lining. Yes, that there always is one. I really always this one. So during COVID, I got my daughter access to masterclass and they had some dog training stuff in there and she did that with my havinies. It was a little punk and he so healing, sitting, staying, and there's something called door dashing like when the door opens, they run off the door and he doesn't do that anymore. So I don't know if Mario would be interested in training Zinnia and you're getting like an online thing.
00:07:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Because I got a different trainer for the puppy and Denise and Mario lasted approximately one lesson. And then they're like, I don't want to do it again. like, well, then I'm doing it because this is not happening. Yeah. I had an hour lesson with her yesterday and Belle did great.
00:07:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Aw.
00:07:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:07:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yay. Yeah. okay, good. We talked about last week, I need to, I probably should go back and remember that it, but talking about, I think I probably just need to do that because my brain is like not dialing into the details of it. And my AR notes aren't good enough about this section, but basically scope of support and creating an SOP for like you were saying, I don't remember who did it. I guess it. was Glenn, I think it was Glenn, where Vijay and Abhishek did things that they shouldn't have done and it was a lot. so how even did it get to them in the first place?
00:08:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, okay.
00:08:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So in reality, Bobby's the one that stopped because he kind of okayed it.
00:08:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So that's what I was asking is what's the routing process?
00:08:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
how did the ticket come in?
00:08:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Who saw it? How did he get to Abhishek and Vijay? Exactly. That comes into the desk. Typically, Bobby is the first person to get on any tickets. I never do. Sometimes, sometimes they'll tag me in for whatever reason. Eric, Sometimes it's tagged in, but usually Bobby's the first person to touch it. Maybe they're trying to get him or not entirely shown.
00:09:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Typically. So is that not even a standardized process? Yeah, I guess so because I asked you a question, you said typically Bobby's the one that sees the tickets first. so you said typically that makes me ask, is that even a standardized process who's checking and who's assigning and who's accountable?
00:09:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I think they all are assigned to him. So buy him.
00:09:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is the volume of tickets?
00:10:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, like, one a week, maybe.
00:10:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Glenn asked for something and Bobby said, okay, and sent it to Avishak and Vijay, basically.
00:10:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Not realizing what he was asking for was more than what it seemed. Because the framing of it was, oh, yeah, just take this funnel and make it that funnel. Bobby didn't realize, like, yeah, that's part of it. But then you also need a new calendar. You also need a new automation. also need to tell you also, right? So it was like, it was the behind this. It was like the underlying functionality that was time absorbent, not the, like, duplicate this funnel.
00:10:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So is part of the. the process be then if there's a technical request that comes in that whoever assigned it, like, let's just say it's Bobby for right now, which long term probably is not the best thing. But if it goes to a dev team saying, what is the scope of this, like, what is involved and if they say, okay, we think it's this, this is how long it would take, then whoever comes back and says, okay, this falls within your scope of support, anything beyond. Like, if you have additional requests or we find out that it needs more, how, I'm just trying to figure out how would we word the contingencies, the, the qualifier.
00:11:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So yeah, so Bobby's working on that.
00:11:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So he's like, and we had started this many moons ago, right?
00:11:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And it was like, this is included, this isn't. So if it comes in and you're like, oh, yeah, that's, you know, we could. categorize it at that point or tag it and go content update, you know, site update, content update, new page, right? All the stuff that's included is that. And then we do these other included things like monthly plug in and we're pressed like that's all non-request based. So if you look at the tickets that come in are three kinds. Update content, which is all we ever get from Mark or Isaac really. Customer support, like I just bought strong marriage now and I can't log in. So we handle that, we'll forget those but Rebecca actually does that so we have her in there because they have their own help desk person but she uses the centralized help desk. And then the third one would be, I mean an example would be length. thing, which to me would be new components. But you could also, what would also fall in that not covered category would be new landing page, new form, stuff like that.
00:13:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which I'm new name.
00:13:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, no, just very specific, right? a new content page? Sure, yeah, that's going to be an opt-in page and a new form, the most negative. What they were requesting was a new funnel, like straight up. And it was like a book, a call funnel, you could call it, right? was. Yeah, it was like, yeah, was a book, I would call it a call funnel, which we, they had one. So they were right and like, oh yeah. We just want to make another version of this, but there's no, it's not cut and paste at all. Well, I mean, parts of it on, they don't know that. So their interpretation of this cut and paste, whole thing done. And I think Bobby's interpretation was also cut and paste. Oh, yeah. And he just set to damage it to BJ. And then they came back, they don't question anything, right? They just do, which is very developer-y.
00:14:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, done. We're gonna get it done.
00:14:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And they got it done. And then it was like, oh, PS that took 10 hours. And Bobby was like, wait, what? Which in the grants do you know things? It's not that big a deal, right? Because most of the time we get zero requests from Glen and Ross. So we're just making 700 bucks a month, doing nothing.
00:15:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
except there an allotment of developer time that a person can have. So let's say all of the requests.
00:15:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, they get none.
00:15:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:15:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They only get what they get and there's no custom anything. There's no whatever. It's like, hey, you get these things. So, and there's no limit. Like, you could add plenty of new content pages, but no one's ever going to do that. So it could be later on, we change that button right now. It's like all framing and do like set it and forget it. Like, you don't need to be adding blog posts or if you do, you can do it or we can do it. So, those guys were, they'll also add like a product here or there and that's like super simple. So that's included. It's like, oh, they want to add. They always do some weird . Oh, you know, need a 3K 150 month. All right. Well, no, I mean, fine.
00:16:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a good perspective. Is there a due date for Bobby having this documented?
00:16:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I've missed the meeting on Monday, so I don't know where it's at. I I think his first line was just going to dig up what we already did. I feel like it's already done. We just didn't really. We got to figure out, like, I guess, in a way to help us do this. Hey, a call bundle takes 10 hours. So therefore, the price of a call bundle is 10 times the hourly rate that we already have, which I don't know at the top of my hand. I want to say it's like $90.
00:16:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I feel like I remember. like two years ago maybe that you had a price chart for hourly rates.
00:17:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yep we have it if you're looking somewhere and probably it's based on Abhishek and DJ's black quilts like Greg's.
00:17:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Anyways, of time right?
00:17:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah or they buy the thing. So we say okay it's gonna cost this. So some stuff you would just need little pre-priced. Hey a new landing page of form is this. Hey a new funnel book a call funnel is this. A new sales funnel, three steps sales funnel thing. And then we could have these things pre-built as important templates from the basis cloud library. just don't because we can't build them yet. Because that part doesn't work. Because the theme isn't done right?
00:17:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
guys are fixing another dragon.
00:17:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh yeah. My version of it, it's like, hey, we would have the Cloud Library template of, hey, this is a automatic customer funnel. But they're going to charge them what we're going to charge them, and the fact that we have a Cloud template, not their concern. We built it, we use it, you still pay 900 bucks or whatever it is.
00:18:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is named Frank back from vacation.
00:18:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think he got back.
00:18:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So he gave some deadlines of when he thinks the first thing will be done, but you think it'll be done soon. I'm trying to remember what the first thing was.
00:18:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I had it written down. He wants the wolf or site.
00:19:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, no, the first thing was to build the wolf or side on 2.0 Oh, you just like got really far away or muffled or something He wanted the wolf or site built on basis 2.0 But he didn't know it was already done.
00:19:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I didn't either. I was like, I think that's done But I don't I'm not I'm not gonna say that on this call And then I think I have to check me to let him know, but he was on vacation. So they were like, hey, we already did that So we're gonna go work on this stuff What's next? They just start working on the theme And they sent the code For review, I think they tagged in Nario Then they sent it to Frank. So ultimately Frank is like, hey, I want a code review before I get it and then when I get it we're gonna come in I get it and review it and it's good It'll get committed for there literally are waiting for Frank And does he have it Huh, huh yes, yes, okay, yes Or like it's in the get waiting Oh What's what's the status of brain tree and moving and all of that There Eric was all pumped So he thought he had it solved and then this morning reset you got hit again It's like oh well not solved But no one else is getting hit. It's just reset you now so that makes me think that Ross or Glenn's admin is compromised. So I was like they don't need to be admin. So we removed that like an hour ago and then I was going to look at one thing, but I didn't have a chance to look at it yet. We installed this, we installed two plugins, but one looks for attacks and the other, like, logs a bunch of activity. So they're, like, getting in through an admin, it should show up in there. But there's also the idea that they were already logged in. And they just, so then we just unlocked, we logged everyone out. It moves WP log in. So if they were going straight in, or were already logged in, now they should be logged out. And then if Glenn and Ross were compromised, they no longer have.
00:21:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that was one of the main things that I learned a long time is a long time ago is not have WP admin as the login, like, we would use secret link or something like that.
00:22:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
instead of it.
00:22:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that there are zero admin accounts like the admin default is changed to something else. So that anything that's default basically got changed to something else.
00:22:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and then prank was like you need to rotate your admin password like every 60 days. And we should use this thing called one pass. We don't log in. We log in through WP Manage or I do. So then I was like, everyone just needs to use that. We just change WP Manage. Okay, breaking up so bad and trying to figure out what you're saying.
00:22:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think I got the gist of it. He said change your passwords every couple of months or six months? 60 days. 60 days. Okay, that I was like, it sounded like two. I remember a six, okay, that was every 60 days and he said use one pass and you said you log in through Managed WPAs, WPAs. So you don't have to get rid of rain tree?
00:23:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Known at this point. Okay. Maybe it seems like a maybe we can if no one else has gotten hit, which makes me think that there's and the Presidium guys did find malicious code on reset. You and they didn't find any on other sites. So it could be that they're only able to get into that site through whatever backdoor they created.
00:24:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You Well, hopefully that gets fixed. Oh yeah, where are we at with more surf stuff?
00:24:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I just finished. We are advanced. No, it's not done. And halfway through is a Google analytics board. And beyond. But finished the first two sort of. The steps of. Yeah, like their. Valley and now I'm moving into. The next level. I'm doing the GA for one. Right now. and then he has like a GTM advanced that I'm doing after today probably and then uh there's like uh oh there's uh oh and then I hit up Melissa and was like hey are you out there she's like yes but i'm on vacation of course you are in european that's what you people do uh so she got back from vacation today maybe they all go away at the same time uh and I sent her all of his stuff so he has like two forces whatever right so he has like two it's really two videos he has two videos on looker from their kind of point of view and then he has um those reports his eye on the journey Report thing and they have all these graphics that are like pre-built for you that you can use start like hey Log in here. Watch these Then I want to build these reports. I set up a bunch of the events for it. I think correctly and then let me know when you're done and We'll take the next step. So shoot price started looking at that yesterday Okay Okay, so oh no, I'm sorry today today. She's back today Sent it to her yesterday What would she be doing is like creating your version of the report for you? Yeah, yeah, she's she does all of our GDS stuff So she built like that that screen cap I sent you the other day of that report.
00:26:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's all her You built that What screen cap of a report did you send the new subs and new cancellations? I don't remember seeing a report.
00:27:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, you didn't look then. And what's the report was like, there's like, there's a graph.
00:27:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yes, chart chart chart. Okay.
00:27:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So we have a bunch of different charts in Google data studio that are based off of blue data and gravity data. We don't have anything that's, you know, extending Google analytics or not Google on the floor. But she's our, she's our go to for that. And I think like, you know, it's going through this course. I set up the variables to do or to mail or get the variables and the parameters or whatever. I said all those up to be able to do it for two journeys. it's sort of the path. the journey path to purchase so which path will they go down and then just like the straight product journey which would be a product checkout purchase so those should all exist as data in Googling will explore now for like you know only like a week or whatever but and then they'll just continue to accrue.
00:28:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you describe those journeys again path to purchasing straight product journey.
00:28:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So path would be the go to the two paths page then they go down one of the paths of winner ninja only then they go to the product page and then they check out the other journey is that they start on the product page and then they check out or everyone that goes to the product page so even if they came from a path I just want to see hey what happens or project project page on and then I can connect to build three journeys so it would be path one path to and then like home page button to product page which is the probably the most popular way people get there.
00:29:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So is it like a I don't know like a goal setting kind of like with behavioral so I'm not referencing GA for because I haven't used it but previous google analytics you could map out goals and they had customer behavior where you could look at their journeys from where they entered this page this page. So no, what does this look like? Like in a layman's professor?
00:29:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah yeah so what you are talking about doesn't exist anymore at all. So everything in GA4 is event based. So, like of those reports, I'm firing events for those steps, but then in order to visualize it and see it as like a funnel or see a breakdown of people going through each individual step, right? let's say, hey, how many people hit the product page? Well, that event is product page, page view event. So, it would take that level and be like, okay, you had 100 people, this is the product page. So, instead of it being URL base, like it was in J4, you're using events and the reason you're using events is because they can only fire once, right? So, you don't have to worry about, oh, did this person come to get, right? The page views are not really page views, whatever, it's really like this many, it was 100 people, 100 events fired on this thing, conceivably. And then you'd say, then you have multiple events on the page. So, then the next event is add to cart, or the next event is, you know, you can have multiple events. so, you're doing, you're doing, we have a report based on the events. And then you can put it together by like, OK, event one is page view of path page. Event two is page view event of path one. And then event three is page view, obviously, this person above the priority, right? This page view of product page. then the next one is page view of checkout. And the next one is page view of purchase page. So then you could say, OK, show me that. Show me the breakdown of that in percentages. So he has like, one side is just like the numbers. OK, 10% of the people saw the page one. And 20% went to path one. And 80% went to path two. And then you can start. And you start basically right now, we're just establishing a baseline. Like, I need to know what's actually happening. And then. And then he's got some like, he says, oh, what's his number? He's, I'm going say his, he says that everyone's card should be 10% add to card. It's not like that. He's like, we've done so many sites and you'd average as 10% if you're not getting 10%. That's where you start. You should start figuring out why you're not getting 10%. So we get the number. And then we see, are we 10, are 20, are we 2? Then that's the right side of the screen. And then the right side of the screen is more of like an actual funnel visualization. And it's showing you going through the steps of the funnel, but his funnel is that those eyes, impression, interest, interaction, whatever the five eyes are. And then those events are separate events. could, you can have some of them might be like impressions is the same impressions, but then interest is hey, they scrolled and saw the variations or they, whatever you decide. So I don't have those ones set up yet, because I have to figure out what they are.
00:33:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I, I love this. mean, because how many times have you talked about how much the data matters and that's. Um, so does it have a built in heat map where you can see the activity or the equivalent through the events, like can an event be mouse over the cart button or, um, to a certain page or click or hover or things like that?
00:33:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So like one of his events for like interest would be, um, scrolled to make this up, right? And was at that location for four seconds or more. So then that event would fire. He's like that shows that there's interest and you can sort of Find these events right find those more specific events by Watching like clarity videos or whatever, right? You might go watch a bunch of clarity videos and go Oh, there are people doing this like I should I should track that. I should see You know, whatever whatever it is. I'm good example But your example is correct, right? You would define The add to cart button is like, okay, they or the for us it would be like the Drop-down menu of sections, right? like oh, went to this they stayed in that sections area for this long So they were thinking about it or and then or maybe you can find an event like they interacted with that menu That's gonna get more into this advanced GTM. That's part of a gun to that's where you start writing your own JavaScript and you're and you're firing events using JavaScript based on Thumbs up so but other stuff like scrolls already built in so you can Take the scroll data that's already there and then you're going to marry that with Hover and whatever that's not built in There's a bunch of basic stuff that's built in you just have to turn it on That sounds so awesome Yeah, he's definitely it's definitely been demystified. I'm like, I'm almost there. I'm like, okay.
00:35:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm starting to pick it up now That's good And I love that you had Melissa because with Google Data Studio like it should provided the the new framework right the user interface um is being understood she should be able to be useful in So you being able to say which is to me the main goal of you having enough of a technical understanding of what needs to be done in the business to hire and choose the experts to actually do the thing, work in the business, and also to be informed enough to direct them specifically to the most leveraged activity, which I think is, you know, like Melissa, you have Norio the code overlord and Frank and Melissa for analytics and Bobby for meeting management and conversation, so that is to me the way that, so I was, I started EMeth again because I have Mark and the guy who referred me to reading that, and so I was just, I'm like, well, it's been like 12 years, I should read it again, and I was looking at that going, I was listening, thing just in the very beginning and thinking about the 30,000 foot view that they start describing about what needs to happen in the business and then I'm thinking like why am I not out of business yet and other people doing this stuff and then I heard the thing and it was like this is always the issue with EOS, EMITH, with any of these things is that the work that I do and the way that it's work with are different is that we want the good business practices and the good business systems and it lines up with a lot of that but we want and prioritize freedom over time and who we work with above profits like for Mark his priority is I don't want to go to the office if I don't want to go to the even if I don't want to go in for a month. He wants to work, he wants to have his business, he wants to have it profitable, but come hell or high water, he's going to figure out how to do that without having to be in the office for a month if he doesn't want to go in for a month.
00:38:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's new.
00:38:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and that's why I'm having conversations, because I'm like, he's definitely not there.
00:38:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But I don't remember hearing that before. No, I definitely did not exist before.
00:38:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so it does. And the thing is that there are always trade-offs, but these trainings don't talk about human trade-offs and making anything that's other than prioritizing the absolute best health of the business rather than the absolute highest value of the visionary being that which is what I'm always going for. And because a lot of the times we do think like for you, it's pace. Like that is more important to you, I think, than well, then then profit, but so is no drama. So not feeling like things are stressing you out either because of the people that you're dealing with or making yourself go, you know, this is the deadline. It's the deadline. It's got to be the deadline. Realizing that deadlines are arbitrary anyway, really. It's this because we said it's this and it should be this, which is what happens most of time, the same with financial goals. That's what most businesses live and die by. And even an email, and he's like, and it's hard work, but it's worth it. And I'm like, it depends on who you ask. And how hard it is. Like, so none of us are opposed to work. We all work. We work consistently. something we show up all the time. But I think it's kind of almost the obsession level and the required discipline. Like even, oh, what's his face? see it. It's the profit profit first. Yeah. Yeah. What? So none.
00:40:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's creating a job.
00:40:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, oh, I'm never doing that. None of these, to me, are the simplest forms of success. Right. There is always extra and and they talk about the 80-20 rule, but I don't think that they really understand it or they they just overcomplicate it because We really don't have to have that much organization and structure. The bottom line is what are your most profitable activities, effective hourly rate, that kind of math, right? And what are the things that have to be done in the business or it fails to exist or it diminishes that is tedious and takes the visionary away from the most profitable activities. Those are two massive leverage points. Number one, you spending more time doing the most profitable thing, which almost always is also the thing that people love most. That's why it became the most profitable thing because you loved it first and we're good at it, almost always. In fact, I have not seen an exception yet. And the other one is as quickly as possible and creating a path to this if it doesn't exist. all the other things that pull you off of that off of your plate on someone else's. Specifically, someone who can work autonomously and not need to be micromanaged or anything like that. To me, those are the first two levers to go after. And then systematizing inside of that. But mostly, it's just a huge awareness of the greatest value in the business, starting with human resources, starting with the visionary, depending on how small it is. And then a single person of support in the highest level. So like Seth Ellsworth, his biggest person would be a salesperson, or a lead generator. The next biggest person would be an automations person, because what he does is largely automations. For Mark, Mary, um looking in the documents or looking at some of the reports and managing managing the people being available frequently and then having attorneys over their pods just being better leaders has you know those are his leverage points for you a developer because so much of it is technical and then a person to track tasks and move them forward and not necessarily a single person in any of these things but those are leverages and so you know there are things to glean from email from bill to sell from EOS but yeah anyway just contemplating all of that and but but things like that so you understanding going for a full circle how staying on top of technology has been a massive lever for me is for you, too, because the technology itself is the lever. So GA for being able to provide so much data, but the first thing is you have to wrap your head around GA4 and how it works in order to unlock the gift that it has in its data. And knowing most people will never do that, most people are just kind of going in the dark because they don't have good data, they don't know where to get it, or they won't put the effort in if they do know where to get it. anyway, you just leveled our leopard game, that was a long way to say that's what you just did.
00:44:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, yeah, I mean, I think that, you know, I just come back, it's like, it's the age old thing. It's like, there is no system, there's no system. Not working a system and there's no system if you're not building a system. So I'm like, you gotta build the system first and then work it So I'm no problem and usually where people fall down is they never build the system So it's like, you know, you didn't set the weather. It's like he hasn't built the the way to get an automations person in there, right? and it's like oh, yeah, you're gonna build that mark but it's funny about mark is like The other day was like, hey, I think you need to start recognizing that and your right hand not Mary Here we go Salka's getting deeper and deeper in there.
00:45:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would like to hear more of that.
00:45:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What how He's deeper and deeper in there like he's interacting with Sam and Are you saying Salka is the right hand? Salka was saying that he said that to mark. He's like you need to Start recognizing that like I'm your right hand not Mary And that his right hand needs to be someone like Salko, not Mary, because Salko can go into an arbitration. Salko can go in and tell Sam, hey, no, you're doing that wrong. And like level up the things that matter. Mary's more like a ops person. It's like, no, should just be the, like, I think you just nailed it. Like, she's the one that should be looking at dashboards. That's not Salko's gig. You should be the one that's like, hey, your leads are down. Hey, retainers are off pace. Hey, but you know, calls going out is low, right there. But you know, our job, you know, is getting those metrics in place to be established and be then set that baseline and say this equals that. Therefore, if this is not happening, then that is not going to happen. And I think I actually had Josh did something with phone calls that he sent me. I haven't looked at it yet. Because I started, look, I started wondering about that. like, okay, if we can't track an intake person, which we can't, which I understand, because they don't don't get assigned the lead. That totally makes sense. It's like, well, they all do the same thing. They all make calls. So there's got to be a relationship between all volume and whatever, right? what was the differentiator about July? What made July different than every other July before it, right? Part of it was lead sources. But like, what even the best lead source hit the bend. So it's like, well, it wasn't just that, right? Like, and what's really great about it was like, in the mark three years ago, monkey did that to him three years ago in July. Totally different stories being told at that point. You're like five alarm fire, we're at, because we got zero retainers this month, right? like, he would have been like, so underwater. And I was like, no, that's not you can now have your best lead source totally crap out on you.
00:48:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, and you set a and you set a record. And that is the leverage.
00:48:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's a risk. Yep.
00:48:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're welcome. Mark. Right. Thank you. Because he's like, well, because he didn't even have a system for it. He didn't have a schedule for it. He didn't, whatever. I'm like, who goes and buys new vendors? do. do you do that? How often? Well, um, like, okay. Yeah. Yep. All these things. Um, hold on. Let me. Oh, you were so lead. Let's talk about mom for a little bit. I have to cut off right at one. Um, unless there's something else you'd rather talk about.
00:49:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Another Sunday one's just chugging along it's high season and we're just I'm it's all It's me just figuring out this the analytics piece is gonna unlock it all I'm about to ask ask Mercer my first question yesterday, which is something missing in their training some of their trainings old I'm like, hey, this doesn't exist anymore. I Don't even really need the thing, I'm wondering if they have an answer and then I'll get to this other bit And then I'm gonna hit them with my KPI. Hey Let's say I want to try new customers. I still got to get that answer But that's gonna be my big question for them. The rest all make sense And I'm just gonna go on the Legos in place. We just had an hour and a half long call about mom.
00:49:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So go. Oh Yeah, huh. Yeah.
00:49:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, got moved to today.
00:49:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Oh Yeah, cuz well our last call was an hour and a half also Cuz time flies I'm like I was this call almost was over already. Um, what was I? Oh, yeah. Okay. So another 71, that was kind of why I wasn't pausing on that because because of the analytics. And I already asked you about record stuff and just seeing what's going on there. But I haven't asked about mom in a couple of weeks, other than you know, was Mark working on the book. And I don't remember your answer, but basically they're doing other things.
00:50:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, the book is done. It needs to be edited. And then Katie comes back on Monday, so I'm going to yank around the side and be like, I need you to help me edit this book. So her and her husband will probably help me edit the book and then the book will be done done. So that'll probably be done hopefully, you know, next seven to ten days from Monday.
00:50:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, what's next?
00:50:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Then I'm going to revisit like all the all the checklists. So we had like a release checklist, that checklist, I gotta make sure all those are up to snuff, you know, as far as Greg goes, because I think he made one, but I don't think he made them all. Make sure those are done and then sort of revisit the mom's site and be like, okay, now let's make it really show what we do. So I was on a call with them today, and Sean's label wants to sell land, so they acquired Lansdown's catalog as part of being signed to the label. And now the heads of the label got ousted, he literally just texted me that because I'm like, what's going on? So they got, they were like, hey, you can buy your catalog back. And they want to charge them 250 grand, which I just went on Chats UPT for like a while, and I was messing around. The value of the catalog. like is way higher than that based on what Chechi PT was saying, right? Me going, Hey, how do you do this? How do you do that? What's a multiple, right? So I got to verify some of that stuff, but it, you know, as Chechi PT does, I'm like, Oh, that's not real. Like, I don't know if this is real, but. And then I was querying it, whatever. So there, there's definitely like a formula that you could use. So of course, Mark home, you know, home run, Grand Slam. Grand Slam is like, Hey, we could go around and start buying other outer catalogs will go get investments money and blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm like, no, bro, no, no, no, no, no, no. Like, why don't we go back to AFM, which is Sean's label and we make them an owner finance offer. So we buy lands down catalog back. It'll be money down into paying interest rate, firms with a payout by whatever, they'll get a monthly, a guaranteed monthly payment. And then we have some sort of bio clause that we can buy out whatever because my Arc was showing me and Spotify what happened with his band, so he's been playing around with Cross-McTill using some of the fan flowy stuff. And their streams are just like going up and up and up and up. But they are nowhere near as big as Lansdowne. And then this other band that we work with, they signed with a company called Amuse, which is sort of like what we're doing. And those guys went and started promoting non-point, and their streams started going up. And Amuse is getting a chunk of that revenue. So they're like, Lansdowne has better bass numbers than both of those bands. And what a shock Tina, Lansdowne has never used any of the fan flowy stuff. Because why would you when it's right there in front of you for free? So, of course, today they're like, do you want to buy Lansdowne's catalog of like no? But after I did the whole thing, I was like, wait a minute. Like, what if, Angela, what if mom bought Lansdowne's catalog, owner financed, right? Don't, none of this go out and raise capital because you're just inviting people in that you don't want around in 10 years. Like, so you go in and your owner financed it. And I, with GPT, I was like, hey, how long has Spotify been around? So I sort of came up with this custom formula that says, well, Spotify might not be around in 20 years. So don't give me evaluation on 20 years. But the calculation that I did give me, it was saying, which I do feel it could be pretty valid. just got to go, you know, find something. And it had like, oh, this source, this source, this source. So it might mean some tweaks, but, you know, over a 10-year period, it was saying that the stream revenue is worth, which is based on actual Spotify data, that it's worth 1.5 million. I was like, okay, so if we can come up with that formula and then we can actually figure out like what it's worth, then you could go do this with other bands. You go to the whoever owns the catalog and you just keep doing these owner fine hand steals. Like, hey, we want to buy this one for that and then you bring them in and then you put your promotion engine behind it and then whatever those numbers were, they're wrong because you're now going to increase all that revenue, but you're going to do it to an asset that you already own. So I like, all right, that's kind of interesting. That's like building this asset, like this recurring revenue asset that can go out 10, 15, 20 years and then God forbid, one of these bands breaks, like, all right, yep, we need to look into that. So we got our first there, Sean and Eric are setting up the staff stuff tomorrow. We're bringing on a DIY client, it's going to be the first person to like, just, he's going to pay, I think, $97 a month and he's just doing it himself. So what he wanted, he was like, when can we get access to this? he's going to be our little beta tester. Norio, I got to send him a video today. I don't do right after this. So he has, he needs some help with his. He's building this song lookup app for us that uses this service called song link. That's part of the onboarding that we have. It's part of the promotion engine that we need the artist to be able to quickly get all the links for all the streaming services by searching their song. He's building that, those search their song. They go, yeah, that's it. And then it will update like 10 custom fields inside their account. So they could do that for like up to three. So we promote retell them to pick three songs. So hopefully when I send him today, we're. Yeah. Hopefully when I send table, get him over the hub and then he's going to look at this DNS app that we might build is the biggest sort of hurdle for use or so far has been getting their DNS setup. They're like, OK, not going to go, daddy. Hey, person, there's no idea what we're talking about. Go in and add this MX record, that MX record. Oh, yeah. Yeah, good luck. So people are just borking on that. And Mark found this software that looks like it's exactly what it does. And they have an API and all that good . I'm going to kick that to my own next.
00:57:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll your MX records for what they need to be.
00:57:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It does it all. Yeah, it's just it's wizard or fives setting up all your DNS.
00:57:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you just give it like a registrar or something or how does it.
00:57:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. No, you give it your domain name and then using their app, you're already approved with like Wix. And like so many of these people are using Wix or bought their domain through Wix and then never built the site. And high level only works with like GoDaddy and CloudFlare, which some we had. Some people use GoDaddy, but, you know, if they have Dane, whatever, this, this middleware works with anybody. So then you, when you're authorized through them as fan flowy, then you're authorized to go in there at the DNS records on all those other providers. the person is just, you know, essentially. So like MailChimp uses them as an example, one of the big clients is MailChimp. So anyone that goes on MailChimp and needs to update their domain, they're going through MailChimp's app that's using this third party.
00:58:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then the third party goes. You don't have to log into your register.
00:58:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like, I get the access.
00:58:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How do you validate that somebody actually owns that domain?
00:58:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like, what is the verification process? Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I haven't, I just looked at to go play with it, play with the API, and then he'll come back and go, all right, this is how it's going to work.
00:59:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I will check because if they have that kind of permission, I mean, our is your domain safe. If anybody can get into it without.
00:59:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
If it might be that they do just log into our login and it passes it all through. That would make sense. That's probably how it works. So you're like not oh, I think, but it's sort of like that.
00:59:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Like plaid or something like that.
00:59:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's a good example. It's probably like that. They probably pull from a drop down. It's probably very much like plaid. And they just have every frickin provider. And then they can go in. Yeah, it's good. I was like, oh, that's interesting. But it would totally solve the problem.
00:59:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not paying attention to the time.
00:59:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
got to pay attention to the time. right.
00:59:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then that app.
00:59:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. And then I just reached out to the follower flow. guys for an update and haven't gotten an update. And the Spotify app no update waiting for that I think that's gonna take like two more weeks Until we get an answer if yes or no or nothing.
01:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what you said last week.
01:00:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, it's five weeks total So, okay, I think I still do the date. I say in the date. So five weeks or whatever the date I said you is most likely when we're gonna hear back.
01:00:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, I kind of recall that Yeah, um, oh what I was gonna ask Was next steps, but oh no, okay, so let me just say this because I do have to go but What you were talking about with chat DPT and its calculations And I know your brain already goes here, but the thing that I was thinking is how do you validate its formula and you would have to know what its formula is but if you understood its formula and you could validate it by Whatever it's playing data from and however it's making its calculations but basically replicate that formula, those calculations, that outcome so that you understood it and could verify that it works, then you've got a solid valuation process that you can be using for potentially purchasing other catalogs or helping people to sell their catalogs as a service or just another way for mom to generate revenue, but it just really stood out to me that having a formula like that would be really powerful.
01:01:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's what I said to it. I was like, I want to build a formula for this and then it added some stuff. go, well, I don't think Spotify has only been around, you know, Spotify has been around whenever I go, yeah, but how long is it number one? And it's like, oh, it's only the number one since the late 2010, like, oh, great. So now we're going to use that. So let's say, you can't say, you can't give me a calculation based on 2020. years is when I'd be around 20 years.
01:02:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like, you make a good point. We have to consider that they won't be the market leader. like, right?
01:02:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And it can't it literally created like a point system, like based on the age of the band, the age of the band's catalog, the number, whatever. So I need to get it to like integrate some other things. But then the math of Spotify or a stream is 100 percent correct, like 0.004, like it's some ridiculous number. So yeah. Now the question is, will the label go for our finance? don't see why they wouldn't. It's positive cash flow. Right.
01:02:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to pause the questions that are popping up my brain so I can keep to my schedule. But it just goes so fast. So many things to ask and then anyway. Have a good day. Take care of yourself.

Hey, hey, how are you?
00:00:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Good. me just grab a glass of water. just realized I don't have that for saw my desk.
00:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hold on.
00:00:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Do you have a fabulous weekend?
00:00:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I did.
00:00:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yay.
00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I needed it.
00:00:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, good. All right, my water.
00:00:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm already looking at flight for next time.
00:00:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Alexa, stop. Okay. So I was hoping we can just open up a Google Doc and just knock out details of the offer. Yeah. And then, um, I don't want show your screen or my screen, but I didn't want to show you one quick thing. I just put together. they're like over the weekend just finalizing it now. This is what I put together. She had this is one of the two gay clients. And she sells ADHD stuff for kids, but also this child custody binder, that's why she was taking a long time to decide what niche to go after. So we're starting to after this one and the whole parenting niche. But I'm really proud of this.
00:01:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This looks awesome. Very good.
00:01:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Anyhoozy. So yeah, so pretty proud of that.
00:01:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah. That's awesome.
00:01:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
she happy? Oh yeah, she she's I'm very careful with her what she spends because she's like really been through a lot and doesn't have a lot of money. So I'm always helping her above and beyond. Without a doubt. But yeah, she's happy with everything. Whenever she gets on a call of me, or if I help her something on her Shopify e-commerce store, she makes money. And unfortunately, one time she had someone else help her for ads, and then the ads went tagged after that. So, but literally, she's someone who only has like a budget to spend like $25 then ads. Like, that's it. That's why I'm saying I go slow with her.
00:02:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but yeah, she's, she's happy.
00:02:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
My biggest issues, I really don't want her to spend a lot of money on tech stack. So I'm probably going to transfer this. That's what's been taking me the long time. I think I'm just going to transfer this to system I owe for her because it's so much cheaper than anything else. And has email, everything. But I'm just going to tell her, I thought I would do it. screw it. Like, I'm just going to tell her to hire someone for $50 to recreate it in System I owe because I was trying to do it a little bit on the weekend, but learning new technology, even though I like System I owe, I think it's really good. And there's another woman that that big Facebook group that that that that lady runs digital wealth, whatever, she teaches them System I owe as well. She's got a really a business model. Do you want me to do this? Give it to you in a nutshell. know we're supposed to do this for nine. Okay, so $47 I'm in the thing and she's teaching a lot about social media, building organic growth, but very, very emotionally positive mindset stuff in there, which I think is really good for lot of people. Like it's almost like this is kind of maybe the end result what we want. So I'm like, holy cow, this is good. But what she does is anyone who buys, she has a regular opt-in how to make money online, start a business online webinar, and then sells her courses, which she whitelables to you. So for $900 at the end of the web or if you buy it, you get her whole funnels and Kooloo Testimals everything and the ability to resell her stuff. And the training is really in-depth about how to take it inside. System IO is the choice that they use because it can have the whole course in there and everything. And there's crazy amount of testimonials that people Then all she needs to teach someone, because think about it, she's simplified, starting on business from the complex to just simple, where you're just focusing on branding and traffic, social organic traffic, you could use ads too. And you don't have to now worry about delivery, because you have a proven product that's actually high values. It's not crap. know, like some other people sell licensing stuff too. And then if one chooses to then create their own digital products, they've already then locked in, locked in, how to do traffic and have a personal brand and the list, your own list.
00:04:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What? What was her domain?
00:04:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let me share a screen again. I don't know what her domain is for selling the 900. I could probably find out if I dig or into it.
00:04:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've been trying to say to be different digital wealth, like academies and- Yeah. It's digital growth academy, but- growth.
00:04:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But this is only the 47 a month, right? This isn't selling the 900 thing. So, um, I don't know where in here, like I'm in the community in the classroom. That's the only thing that's weird. And like, she'll has Texas sport calls. Anyone who buys the $900 gets free access to this, I think membership. So, so everything that's in here, um, and she does this, you know, like 90 day success sprints day one day. Like, it's, it's really good. I mean, it's, it's something that, you know, you and I would create with full value transparency, giving value to people. Um, or we could just become, I was even thinking, just become a damn good affiliate for her because a lot of people are pursuing early, like she's gotten all these wins, like all these people making sales. She's got, look at all the pages of sales. What's that? sorry. I just had a funny message. She was like 18,000 and 32 pages of wins.
00:05:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Rosie, do you think it would be helpful if I join and pay for that? So that we're studying the same thing because here's the thing either we're creating our own path and just using it or That it will be what I do and we do it always should be but I Love modeling after somebody who's doing something similar to what we want to do and making a couple tweaks and I feel like if we're Number one it doesn't work with school to share logins or whatever and for the price. It's nominal Anyway, I'm just kind of study that and be on the same page Because it's low ticket because so you think that she's you know Telling the truth not really the bro marketer club.
00:06:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Just kind of She's definitely a bro marketer and you know who she hires in their dual mindset coaching is the same female mindset coach from LA That was on sunset that Netflix show sunset and I watched a little blurb of the mindset coaching. It's pretty good I think what amazes me to two things to you. What amazes me is Um, her, I'm just going to give this link to you. She's only been in this for two or three years and she was, I think, in network marketing and then she switched to this and one of her friends or colleagues, just like how you and I are connecting, one of her friends colleagues, it was a really good web funnels and tech stuff. So that's why they decided to create this because they figured that's what was missing. So I think she had a big boost from the start of all of her MLM people because this is so good for MLM people, right? To eat up and find another revenue source.
00:07:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know if we want to focus on such beginners. So that's my only thought process.
00:07:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like, so here's her Instagram thing that this is what her real thing is. So she calls it the free daily pay blueprint PDF, zero six, three or six months coming to here. So this is what she gives you. If you were to pay $900, you get this whole system as well. So you enter your email and then sends me the blueprint and then she's got this legacy build program and I think it goes into a webinar. And of course, she's, this is all in school, like, She just started the school community not long ago either, but she's just growing fast.
00:08:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you're probably one of those ones I kill it in network marketing and really, you got to talk to people a lot and you got to work a lot to do that. Oh yeah, I think is.
00:08:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Go ahead, sorry.
00:08:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's one of the things that is a big something I always want to pay attention to when I look at somebody and look out, why are they successful if they're successful because they're working constantly. It doesn't mean that I can't take what does work and then figure out how to make it work well or just set different goals. you know, maybe she's got 70,000, I don't need 70,000, 10,000, 5,000, 1,000, like, you know what I mean? It's a whole different level and also, I mean, how many people does she have to have to support the team? What kind of margins does she have?
00:08:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What kind of headache is all of that management?
00:08:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, they look good. All the different things and it gives It's exciting, you know, when you see these big platforms and these big numbers, but it's it's really easy to not take into account the cost of that and I'm sure you've done this as well. Worked with a lot of these people in the back end and they're just burnt out, they're happy on the outside and on the inside, everything else is falling apart, their health, they don't see their kids, they don't see their sweethearts, they, you know, there's a lot that you don't see and and the other thing is the difference between like extraverts, introverts and amberverts. I'm an ambervert, so, you know, like I can only spend so much time with a lot of people. I light up, I get energized, but then I'm super drained and I have to recover so I can't do that all the time and I'm not seeking out opportunities to be in front of people, but also if I spend too much time alone, I get depressed, introverts are like, let me be alone. Yes, I'm right there. I'm right there in the middle. Now, you have to take that into account with the business model. I would say I would think you lean more towards extrovert, but probably in the like, but so if here's a spectrum, here's introvert, here's ambivert. I mean, here's extrovert. Here's ambivert. would say Tina is probably right around here. Maria's maybe just a little bit over here, slightly more extroverted, but still probably doesn't need to be with all the people all the time. Yeah. Well, am I right or wrong?
00:10:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, no, totally. Totally. know, and I don't want to be a me too product. I'm going to be honest. Like, I think what we've been talking about, thinking about is really powerful and, and, you know, it was solidified even in my mind today when I saw Alan's post today about how in a nutshell, he just said all the people that he's helping. in his fast forward scale to like $100,000 months or whatever, $1,000,000 months, there's no more messaging of here's how to get five to five more clients, here's how to make more money. It's the messaging that really works is just having like that work, like work life balance, right? Which is what we've been talking about, right? And I believe in it, like a simple, anyways, we don't need to go into all details of that, but yeah, so don't buy it yet, you know, because we may not want to go that direction because sometimes what beginners deflates me because it's hard when someone comes back to you and says I only have like $20 a day to spend on ads.
00:11:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And actually, I think that that's not a bad budget for, for trying things down starts even our seven and eight figure clients with a dollar a day or to $5 a day at budgets and does well. But there's so many things that are an uphill battle for beginners. They don't have perspective and I don't I don't have the energy to want to impart low-level perspective, like the getting started perspective. I can give you impart the perspective of, all right, you've got all these great things, and you're doing all these great things, don't get psyched out and play smaller than you can be, but I don't want to be teaching the basics. I want to teach and offer that as a done for you, like just self-paced do it yourself. I want to teach it because I think that the way that I teach it is different than everybody else, and we'll resonate with the small group of people, and I just want to offer it and let God bring the people who need that, and it's its own thing. if I'm going to work one-on-one or in a group or anything else like that, I need it to be high-level, or at least mid-level, so for doing hybrid coaching, needs to be mid-level. We're experienced, we know a lot, We don't know it all, and we need some hand holding, but the group can kind of hand hold also, you know what I mean, that's that mid level. High level is, I just need you to catch me when I'm screwing up. Tell me the things that I don't know, and then I'm going to go off and do my thing, and I'm going come back and report, and then we're going to do this again.
00:13:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's high level.
00:13:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They don't need a lot of hand holding. I love those people. I barely talk to them. They're my favorite, and they adore me, and likewise, so for us, I think getting started really targeting that mid level person, where we can get some exponential kind of like results, some like raving fans of like, holy crap, you know, this was just, I've been here, here, here, here, here forever, and I just went, whoosh, but I did this without getting really stressed or trying to follow somebody else's thing that doesn't fit me. And that's what I want to deliver to people. And then what I want to do. as while we're doing this for people and making the money that we need to and want to, is figure out what did we do consistently with every single person?
00:14:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What was the process?
00:14:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What was the fundamental questions we asked? Which I mostly have out mapped out in my course that I started. But how could we improve that and so give that to people and then maybe we scale it up and we do a few more of these. Maybe we train some, because there's not enough of these people in the world, there's not enough high level coaches that are really good that can actually serve and take care of people. And so maybe we can train junior coaches or something like that who are really good at walking through this process that we've taught and completely outlined. And then maybe once we have a team meeting where we meet with all of our junior coaches and they say, here's the issue, here's where I'm getting stuck, or this is my plan. And what do you guys think, run it by us? Like, we could have a whole kind of school of ourselves. I've literally never thought this thought before ever. Yeah. So this is all just, it evolves, it evolves. It just keeps evolving. Because I'll tell you what happens. If we weren't talking, I would talk myself out of all of it. It was starting to do it.
00:15:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, no, no, that's why that's why I forced myself to launch a member of what it is. I said Tuesday at 6 p.m. So that's like girl in like five hours.
00:15:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And like, I don't really have much to launch.
00:15:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But I'm very good, I don't know you noticed this about me. I'm very good at teasing people and getting them excited. I've got people already saying, I marked my calendar for 6 p.m. But the thing is, here it is, go buy it for $100. This is going to be like, this is the price, take or leave it. But I have been torn between something that Josh Gavin actually said, because I'm in his little community, because he just called me in. And he's interviewed me about the success of how to float ticket offers. Hasn't be able to take it offers and I respect him, but he sometimes in his group. He's so cute He puts out somebody should do this offer and he'll just list out offers that you should do right like he says I'm too busy to do this. Someone should do this because I would buy this right or and so his latest one He says he says whether one or all of you do this go for it I thought that actually is brilliant He says someone should offer a pocket cmo offer Where for like whether it be 500 bucks a month or a thousand bucks a month or whatever a month You are the pocket cmo where they could twice a week or something Send an illume video to you about what their needs are like what they're stuck on and then you within like say a two day turnaround or 24 hour turnaround send a loom video back to them, right? he said for instance for him He would pay that for someone he doesn't want to hire someone like we're an agency for 5,000 months to run his ads or anything But he would love to if he's ever stuck or what to do share a screen and show someone something and then get the tips from someone else Um And I know my friend Cara who runs all the ads for like soon with Claire and she like paid herself I'm like, why did you do this? really good at what you do. I remember she paid $1,000 for one hour or one guy Who who proposed to be a Facebook ad scaling expert? And she said oh it like I knew more than him I'm like, what did you pay for the point is I thought that was interesting with our skill sets as well pocket CMO, you know And when I started I remember do you know who my kill is do you remember internet marketing? Super friends.
00:17:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, so Somebody people would always try to ask me to describe what I did and it was really hard because no role that I had found ever described it and then Matt Gill was a good friend. I don't know if you know him from nitro marketing Not that well, but I know him. He has a name Yeah, so he's like Ops you do operation. I'm like, yeah, that makes sense. So then I was like Okay, I'm COO for hire. now they have fractional COO. And I was like, yeah, that's that's definitely there. But that doesn't make enough money. I would not do it for anybody because they don't. It's not positioned and valued right for for the level that I do and brain. But I wish if like if you have that post, I'd love to see it because I'd love to send it to a client of mine who would be that that would be a great offer for him pocket CMO. He does the fractional CMO but I like the pocket CMO.
00:18:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
like that level of access because it's more leveraged.
00:18:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need to need this. I got to remember I got homework to do now schools in session. Um yeah anyway okay so let's see screen sharing our offer.
00:18:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Which you want me to share it or do you know yeah however yeah yeah. Okay.
00:19:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, was it the Maria Tina partnership one?
00:19:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know what? We have stuff in there, but I just created a new doc and it's not good. I don't even think I've shared it with you. So I'll just put it in the comments here now in the chat. And I will share screen right now. I have the other ones open too. Done. love it. But, you know, obviously starting to work less, have fun and have a life. And then do we just want to say one on one mentorship?
00:19:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Opportunity? Yeah. I love that. 20 plus year business veterans like, you know, how long have you been doing this? before I I did it online, which is 22 years. It was six years in corporate. And it was for a call center, but I was still managing metrics. And it was basically a business within a business, the call centers work. Because I did my own hiring. I did my own staffing. I did meet my metrics. I had to meet my contractual agreements. So in all of that actually prepared me for what I do. So I would say I'm closer to 28 years with business experience.
00:20:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I quit the big six consulting firms in 1999, 2000. So I guess 24 years.
00:20:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we're close. I would say nearly 50-year combines or we'll say 25 plus whatever. However you want to do that, it's close. Because if you want to be real about it, I also and you did too a paper route for a couple years and all the other things. So if you out of my business years, I've got 30 years under my belt for sure.
00:21:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:21:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow, that makes me old.

Ha. ha ha And this is a mouse. Oops.
00:21:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it's that that let's break down full stock.
00:21:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Okay, for this. I just wanted to put this in before. Forget. Yeah, yeah. Because the feedback I'm getting from people that I did do some one in one calls with, by the way, I do have one in 15 minutes, so, but I get back on with you after that.
00:21:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, just, just, okay, this was only scheduled off till one 30 my time. So that's why someone snuck in and booked.
00:21:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's yeah. Yeah, but I'll be available in an hour after that two, three, my time.
00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm but anyway, you are not looking for money this meeting an hour long because that Tuesday.
00:22:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We have gone the whole weekend.
00:22:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, they have it.
00:22:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Action. I don't know. So yeah, we can go back to the full staff. Yeah. So this is what resonated with people when we were talking just back and forth about so many things to build on the business that you feel called to serve this component, but it'll give you emotional support, support, support, support. really, I think, resonated with people in the PS of the email that I sent a couple days ago, and then you saw some of my Facebook posts that are resonating with people. Maybe it's just cutting out what's in my Facebook post that I wrote on the weekend or Friday.
00:22:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The one I tagged you with. I don't know if you saw that one. I didn't even so.
00:23:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I quoted you in it too.
00:23:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was off. I was like, I'm not online at all.
00:23:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so this one, timeless principles for building a business and it's kind of summary of what we do and it says, what are my good friends to? Marie says, I take you on it. And it said, the offer match to the audience Trump's brand power all day, branding, just sports, organic traffic, so it was your words there because I wanted to slowly bring in you. But, yeah, so it's a long post, but I was talking about, you know, there's so much crap out there. And maybe I just can't pace this because people love this post. Yeah, you know.
00:23:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, let me, oh, go away. I've missed a lot, like apparently the swarms are terrible, and just...
00:24:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you want stop share?
00:24:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no, I just want to... I have my settings so that things that I'm tagged in don't... have to be approved to get on my wall, and like I'll still show up, but I wanted to do that. Go check this for you. Yeah, and then I can go... Wait, wait, that's not it. Oh yeah, no, sorry.
00:24:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, no words, no.
00:24:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Yeah, I see... I'll read it from here real quick so I can see all your... What do you call it? Words? please, but can I just get to my own profile? There, okay. Absolutely brilliant post. Nice job. thing you say, video or write means everything to me. Oh, good. So that's like, I may have heard a version of some of it when I when I hear it from me, it downloads directly from my brain, can't get enough. You have got to keep that as a testimonial and use that, Maria, because that's the thing. That's the type of comments and things that people say to me. This is what makes us most unique.
00:25:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What do you talk about?
00:25:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is a comment on here from Colleen held Ladwaib and she says, everything you say, video or write means everything to me. I totally get it, absorb it. And it's like, I may have heard a version of some of it. But when I hear it from you, it downloads directly to my brain, can't get enough. That is a skill that I have as well too. I that is so unique. I don't I don't know that that I've ever read read anybody say that about somebody else. I'm sure that it's there. I think like Alan and like there are certain types of people, we have, we connect with other ones. So you and I both do a little storytelling and correlating of a technical and tactical concept and put it into life in a way that people can just like go wait a minute, I get that now. You've got a, you are the class from the pulpit side. What we the teacher saw was someone without their ego, I'm gonna cry, getting in their way. You were there to learn all the questions they came at the right time. You followed instructions were first to finish the exercise, give me time to dig deeper. Those are really pioneering days of internet marketing.
00:26:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh yeah, that's my software friend. That's interesting too, but just he'll always couch it with edifying him. He'll never fully me. Oh yeah.
00:26:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm, that reminds me of Seth Laraby. Like he, You did a lot to lift people up, but you'd always be like, my student, my this, and I'm like, yeah, yeah, even teach what you're talking about. Like, he did that with me a couple of times. I'm like, you understand that this was not because of you.
00:27:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So yeah, yeah.
00:27:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, but yeah, okay, you know, I've been walking just you do such a good job of, I mean, even the emojis, the number emojis, I've never think of the number emojis.
00:27:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because sometimes it takes like two, three hours to write one post. So that's why I've been warming everyone up for the last 14 days too, to video post.
00:27:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love it. So, okay, what? Man, you've got to go soon.
00:27:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That sucks.
00:27:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is the best way to use this time to support where your brain has already been going because my brain can go off of on a whole different ten right now.
00:28:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think probably the stack. It's even happened in webinars. I'm so good at the whole webinars. I'm right when it comes to the pitch section of showing the stack or what they get. I fall short a little bit on bringing the power to that. So people convert because they know me. But maybe at the end of this document, I'm just going to say here's what's something like that. What's waiting for you or here's what you're going to get or something.
00:28:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:28:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:28:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Can I type in then you tweak because it works better for me? Yeah, that's how I thinking.
00:28:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Okay. whether you want to do it as a table or they just like, well, let me format it. Let me just bring dump.
00:28:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, for that work. Okay. a so first.
00:30:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love it.
00:30:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You You Whoa, sorry, sorry didn't do that. thought I could add it.
00:35:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, it shouldn't have done that. No, yeah, I was trying to add my own stuff at bottom, just to give you a If this helps from the post, if you talk, I'll lose what I'm saying.
00:37:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, you have a call.
00:37:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I got a dash. If you scroll down, I also put Josh's post in there in case there's any burby ash from there that you want to add about the pocket, CMO and CFO.
00:37:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nope. I don't want other people's rides. I just like, it was going to be fractional, but pocket was cool because boxers in the pocket.
00:37:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
no, I love it.
00:37:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:37:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All right. Talk a couple hours or yes, I have calls into like two o'clock and then I'll need a little break and then I have to get my daughter.
00:37:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

I'm doing great.
00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you doing? I'm good. Time like flies. feels like forever. And also yesterday that I talked to you. Like, it's always the weirdest thing to me that time just is like that.
00:00:18 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The summer going fast for the kids.
00:00:21 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh, yeah. Madeline a lake day tomorrow.
00:00:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. We always go to the beach.
00:00:34 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Pontune. Pontune? Yeah.
00:00:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And so we always go to the beach at the end. And we used to rent a boat on the lake several times, but our lake has been volcanic, I think. So there's a volcano nearby. There is lava rock all around, but it's so purec right now and the fish are dead and the lake is hot. So that map to me is as I'm not going there.
00:01:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So. Wow. Yeah. Let's say that's a new, a new one. It's a new thing to deal with volcanic.
00:01:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not for my area. I mean, because we've got Mount Rainier, Mount St. Helens, Shasta, all, you know, is Shasta is visible to me. And then the mountain by this lake is called Mount McLaughlin. So yeah, we're in the Ring of Fire.
00:01:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's right. And Mount Hood too, right?
00:01:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:01:35 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:01:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. My brother has gone snowboarding there many times. Yeah.
00:01:40 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. That was where I skied for the first time. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
00:01:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How long ago was that?
00:01:47 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh, God.
00:01:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was in college.
00:01:50 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:01:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like 99 or something.
00:01:53 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Hanging out in Oregon. Yeah. Had a buddy who moved out there. Wow. his wife and before they had a kid. No. No, they had a baby and I went and stayed with them for a week and Took me skiing, which I didn't know how to do and it was all ice So yeah, I made a I mean one run where I didn't fall Yeah, it's not as easy as it looks Now there is this business where do you own but you're kind of killing it right now Yeah, um I'm really like accepting or accepting is that the worry. Yeah, excepting we'll go with it like Getting comfortable with the idea of like Like what I like I'm good at writing. I Can I can go in to? know a legit business and I can make an impact with What I do with copywriting and I was just thinking like I always had this mentality growing up of like you know, go get a job, go work. And I was like, working is just what I know how to do. And so I, you know, I'm looking at the stuff I'm doing with Tim and the Jim and getting five grand there. And then I've got another potential client in the, that I mentioned in the conservative political space that I think it'd be a lot of fun to work with. And they're interested in meeting with me. I know them really well through Brian. So, you know, I have no idea what that budget is, but whatever if it's not them, I feel like, well, somebody else I could find to do another five grand a month. And I was just thinking like, you know, I kind of like just going in, having a really defined scope of what I'm doing, focusing on that, and getting paid, you know, feels like a really attainable at least for now, like, putting together, like, like being the face of a product, or putting something out there that I'm, that I'm selling, for, at this point, in my life, like, I feel, I feel really just comfortable selling other other people's stuff for them, like, I'll admit, like, I probably have a, a block on selling. My own stuff, especially if I'm the face of it, and I'm open to moving past that, but at the same time it's like this other skill set of just doing copywriting for people can make me get money and I enjoy it. And yeah, the idea that I was thinking, the term was like, I know how to work like a blue collar person, and you know, because that's what I grew up around, and I was like, what if I just start taking more of that mentality, like an elevated blue collar type of approach where I go and I'm a workhorse, I can still set my hours, I work, you know, five or six hours a day, and it's a manageable schedule, I still set my own hours, and So, yeah, I'm just kind of like, that feels like in the strike zone for me, um, no.
00:06:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have a hard stop at 1230 or whatever time it is for you to 30?
00:06:16 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
No, it's, no, it's 142 for me. I've got to take my dogs to the groomers at three. So, I've got, I've got like an hour. Okay.
00:06:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just want to make sure that we can go through everything, but I just want to maybe think about the language a little bit because all, all words have connotations to them. Yeah. One with blue collar is kind of grunt worker and low value. Yeah. It depends on who you're talking to, right? Amongst the blue collar people, they're like, you know, I'm innocent to work early. you know, and anybody that pays attention to the economy knows that there's a shortage of laborers, skilled laborers. But you're, so there's a couple of things to it. One is that you just, you get things done. So what I would say, and again, there's so many parallels with us in how you serve and how I serve. What I've been called, I think before I even called myself that, then it was Ryan Maran pointed it out, and it's driving. I'm a driver. get things done. I can be driving myself, driving the project, but it's the energy and the momentum behind that word, but it connotation to it.
00:07:56 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Do you know what I mean?
00:07:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. The other thing that, And I think that this is something we could probably start to help you put some meat on and create a framework, which is something I never really did well because I really kind of custom tailored around people. But now that I've been doing it for so long, I realize that there is a plan, there is a strategy like semi modules. For example, to give you is I've got principles and priorities, know, I have to go even look them up. That's how I know what they are and we go through them, but thinking about them chronologically. So principles and priorities, and then it goes into finances, and then it goes to time tracking, and then we go into project management, and then we go into teams. And then we go into hiring teams, and then it's sharp in your saw and kind of mindset and things like that. And then it's iterative, constantly, right? But the reason we kind of start there is because principles informally, priority, priority informs what gets done. And the reason we go to our finances next is because finances let you know what you need to be gunning for, what you can do, what you can't do. Then we get into time because money had to dictate what our resources are before we even think about how we spend our time. But also priorities had to be dictated before we could even think about our times, you know what I mean? So then we get into project management. Okay, now we know what's important to us, we know what we can afford, we know what we need to set as a target so that we can get to the team that we want to work on. And now we know where we're going to spend our time, let's structure it, let's get it into a project management suite. Okay, now that we've got that, who are we hiring, what's our dream team? And it could just be one person that we're starting anyway, but I do kind of have a systematic approach now. Not everybody is at the same place in that conversation has nuance of. looks a little different but really it's not and the reason that it looks different is because of values and priorities and things like that so budgets you know and things like working in front of the screen working behind the scene kind of thing you know things like what's your conversion right right how many eyeballs you're getting on your offer what is your offer how big is your audience list how many offers have you even made to them how long have they been sitting there not getting an offer um you know did you did you just give them one offer and it was way up here did you try down here did you ascend them like there's a whole lot of things that can happen kind of chronologically and so you go through that going oh you missed this spot let's come back here you missed this you know what i mean or you did this but it was we don't have clear data we have data but it wasn't well or you made this change since the last time you did this this. So systematically approaching all the things that you know how to do. Now, if you built that into a written down framework of these are all the things that I'm going to look at because you just do it automatically.
00:11:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's in your head.
00:11:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do the same things. But I haven't really up until now, which is what I'm working on. sat there and documented these are all the levers I'm always looking for in the business.
00:11:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I've been doing it in my head.
00:11:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many times that I tell you, Chris, get it out of your head. You need the document in it. So taking my own advice. But that's where your power is. So back to kind of blue collar.
00:11:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's not blue collar work.
00:11:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's power. And one of the other types of descriptions I've given is I'm a surgeon. I make surgical because I'm not going in there and like, you know, blowing everything up or I'm not pumping you full of drugs that are systemic, right? I'm going to the pain points. We are only going to fix the pain point. We're going to make the least. of damage to the body possible, right? So, and that's where, what is the word? Freedom and cash fastest path, the tip of the time, okay? Fastest path to cash and fastest path to freedom, where they intersect is where we make the most of money in the least amount of time, that's a precision cut. So, you kind of do the same thing because offers our precision cuts.
00:12:26 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:12:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We are not changing your whole business. We're not overhauling the website that you're on. We're not overhauling your tech stack. We're not overhauling your team. We're not overhauling the products that you've created. We're taking everything that you have as existing assets, if possible, and improving the offers made with the existing assets or looking for how can we repurpose the asset into, switch it, or what's a supplementary or complement. entry offer that you can make. From everything that you've ever done with Brian and everything I've seen you do for yourself and other people, those are the precision cuts that you make. So that offers, what I would love to do is just kind of go through your paragraphs section by section and kind of try to do that for you, right? Precision cuts, what can we do to improve that? I would like to talk mostly about your opportunities to make sure that because one thing I think that you can still have help with is you're an offer king except for when it comes to making your own offer as a consultant. What I would like you to do is pretend you are somebody else, okay? So you're not pitching yourself. No, like write it down and you can give him an avatar or something else if you need to mentally disconnect so that you don't. getting that ego thing. Yeah, like, I know everything about this guy. This is what he does. This is what he brings to the table. This is this business. This is how this guy is gonna just help it. And this is what it's worth. And now you're gonna make that pitch on behalf of him, which is you, right? be like, this, this is a no brainer. So if you don't have a brain and you don't So you go and look at the odds that I'm going to be able to get you a 5% lift. If I do this and you support me doing this, I mean, the odds are very small that that fails. You know, if you want to give a guarantee, you don't or in the guarantee could be, I'll say until I get that lift provided, you show up, you provide whatever you're supposed to provide that how confident I am. so I'm not going to give you a money back guarantee because that's my time. But I'll commit my time until we win because I see your stuff is that good, so I'm I'm believing in you and I'm not just asking you to believe in me, but that's how much I'm believing in your stuff is that I'll commit my time guaranteed until we get X results, right, right.
00:15:17 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
People are going to know that most people won't. Yeah, that that's a interesting mental exercise to create a software for for somebody else because I I was reading about people are doing these they call it they call it product highest services basically like design joy is the one who who really the first place I came across it is just a designer that that sells his design services for flat flat fees got a very like clear process before you buy, how it works, like, you know, I'm going to work on one thing for you at time. So that it's not like stacking up, like this is how we're going to work together type of thing. And it's like, you know, I think he's five grand a month. And then and then there are a got a list of other companies that are doing this similar model of productizing their services. I've got some copywriters who are doing that as well. And I was thinking about that around because the thing that I'm I think the thing that I'm best at is email copy. I do long form. I mean, I've written two sales letters for 10, like in really short, short order, one of them. did really well. other one, the offer wasn't as good. He's gonna end up doing a little over 10 grand on that one. But the first one, you know, he did 75 grand and that was a much stronger offer. And so yeah, I'm following what you're saying and I'm thinking about like a way to sell consulting services because I mean really like what I what I really want is to be at place where I'm investing the money that that comes in into cash flowing investments that that pay me you know eventually we'll be able to replace the income that I want to make. make. that's always been sort of what I've had in my mind of like, this is what I want to do. And the way that I've always tried to go about doing that is by trying to put myself in the role of, you know, a specific way to do business, like launching and releasing products. And which, you know, is not out of the realm of possibility for me, but just like right now in the near term, I'm, you know, Brian talks about, like, you got to follow the anecdotal evidence. And right now, the anecdotal evidence is, you know, doing these consulting gigs is bringing in cash. And so it's just got my mind thinking that maybe I need to rethink that whole The whole idea of consulting, whereas for so long, I've seen it as a time for money treadmill. But if I think in terms of a decade, like 10 years, if I were to do this for 10 years, I'm you know, after 10 years, like that's, how old is Grady? Grady's 13.
00:19:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How? How's he that old?
00:19:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:19:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's an eighth grade. Oh my gosh.
00:19:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
This year.
00:19:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, something just along those lines of what you're thinking about, and obviously everybody's different, but I find that my resistance to being out in front is shifting now that I'm getting
00:20:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
getting near the emptying nesting.
00:20:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I wonder how much of that was self-preservation was also family protection. There's a different amount of pressure, and also there's such a thing as internet famous. mean, going into a marketing conference and being recognized, that was a very long time. That was 11 years ago, 12 years ago. And I was barely online. And now, you know, the world is much smaller, and we get there faster with TikTok and YouTube. if you're going to create new content, it's going to go everywhere. So if you're a face, you're a face. And that brings a whole new level of theme that I think naturally, protectively, we don't want our families to deal with. And it does take focus away because we feel. extra level of responsibility to our fans, our audience, our customers, whatever. And they feel an entitlement to the people that they engage with like, where are you? What's going on? Like, that's a whole nother of emotional estimate that I think maybe we don't consciously think about as much as we subconsciously go. You have no, no, no needed, don't want it. And I think that we have both kind of observed that there tends to be a little bit of an ego thing that goes on with a lot of people that are faces that maybe we're trying to protect ourselves against not wanting to be that person. And that, but that has a correlation to the same thing with money. Like, when you don't have money, you tell yourself that having money is bad. And that you don't want to do it because you'll be bad. but money doesn't change people. just amplifies what they are and they get, you know, they reveal it faster. So, Anyway, the thing about the 10 years thing, Grady will be grown, Madeleine will be grown, and into college, that's a whole exit runway there, giving you guys time to, because of course you could always shorten that if you wanted to, with that plan, you're now getting them set up in new houses, going to college, that stuff's expensive, and they in a different kind of way, like really being physically present when they're little, you know, they can go off and play for a little while, but now they're like, they know if you're paying attention to them, they know if you're really invested and available and all that stuff. So anyway, here's what I love about that plan for you. That's what I love about it, but the other thing is, it comes down to the boundaries, which is the conversation we've been having a lot, right? So you used to have a habit, which I think that you're very much getting out of, which is... If I'm here, I have to take care of everything because if I see a problem, I got to fix the problem and If I see the problem I'm accountable for the problem and it should probably come out of my own pocket And because I'm a partner or you know what I mean?
00:23:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Like you took a lot of things on you that didn't belong on you.
00:23:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, sure Yes, but not just Brian. It happened in it with the lease stuff. Um, I think it happened with I want to say Tim It it one of your first consulting jobs.
00:23:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom.
00:23:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, um, yeah because I I You are prone to feel a sense of obligation to something that isn't yours and I think partly out of fear of Maybe just just because you saw it. Maybe it's just because you saw it. So you feel accountable for it Side to comprehend the value and know that you're there to help. And so I think I'm the one that has to help with everything. Anyway, I think that that's what really bogged you down the most is because you can't do all of that. You were getting paid to do all of that. And now because you've created two things, really powerful things that I don't think really existed for you before, like when we first met with Brian and anything since, until around this year, last, last whole year, not just calendar year, and that is boundaries and leverage. So a very more defined scope of support that you both expressed and kept to that that's the important part kept to you. And then the leverage was in that scope of support that also it was that I'm doing this thing specifically. That's all I'm doing. This is the power of it. this is the value of it, this is what it's supposed to bring to the table for you, for me, that like you and the business and your partners. And so, as long as you not only keep doing that but improve that, if you continue to optimize that, your capacity to consult and have an impact and continue to be paid, the other factor is that lever is only as powerful as the way it can lift and the reward it can bring. So, if the person you're working for right now that you did those sales letters, the gym, I can't think of this, that's Tim. And Tom 10, that's how I get it. impact was able to be made because of his resources, because of his instruction. So you were able to plug into something powerful. So that's the other thing is, If you're going to try to help somebody that has almost nothing as a business, it doesn't matter how powerful your step is, they don't have powerful stuff to plug into, know, a 2% increase to $200, 2% increase to $2 million is, you know what I mean? So if you take all of those things into account when you are making those offers, you know, the leverage power, the reward, and also the risk for the drain and everything, that gets mitigated and the reward gets maximized. Yeah, probably all the things you're already thinking about, but I just want to add the support to it and say yes to it.
00:26:43 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I mean, I think like I'm comfortable now with like the idea of like my minimum is, you know, at least 5 grand a month, so that, and I get there, there are a lot of ways to get But for me, I get there just mentally of like, I'm involved in, you know, a couple other things. so if I'm going to take my time to focus on something else, like it's got to be paying me this amount of money. And, and that'll serve as a, that'll serve as a nice filter for people too. But, yeah, I mean, I think, I think adding another consulting client in the other, the other unknown is with this, this tea thing. I spoke to, to Jim yesterday, and he owes me, I'll say he owes me an update by tomorrow. Apparently, the issue there is like, there's, They've got this Microsoft server that their pages are built on and the pages are not loading because of some server area, server error, so they've got this IT guy that they work with. So he's like, I'm going to get these pages up and loading this week and then I'm going to move everything over to Linux server, he's like I'm done with Microsoft. So I mean, it's a technical issue that I like that's more technical than I know what to do with when you're talking about server performance and issues.
00:28:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you said Microsoft server and I was like, what are pages, you've heard said pages, but now I'm thinking more like Windows NT or something like that. Anyway, totally irrelevant.
00:29:03 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Definitely out of Got it. Yeah. and that's, so I don't fully understand the issue, but I believe Jim, like I don't get the sense that, like he's, I don't get the sense like there's anything nefarious going on here, and it's not like they have any leverage to do anything anyway, but.
00:29:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What, now what does he do?
00:29:42 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
What's his business? So, Jim is John's son and.
00:29:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, oh, this, these are the tea. These are the tea.
00:29:53 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay. Okay.
00:29:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's something else in his business is having issues. Like, how does it, does this affect you or just says something keeping him busy?
00:30:05 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, it affects me in the sense of like these, these pages, these sales pages that John wrote. And I'm more or less copy chief, but John wrote the upsell pages. Because of whatever server issue is happening, like they're not, they're not loading. Um, so they're hosting? It, they keep using the word server. Um, it's, it sounds like, it sounds like a hosting issue.
00:30:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, okay, but, um, originally you had the T domain, you had all of that stack. Oh, well now it's on click bank, right? So can you give me the tech stack real quick? Just kind of like where it was before, where it is now, what changed?
00:30:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Um, the offer will be on click bank. So, clipping handles the payment processing, but the actual pages are your pages that you host on your own.
00:31:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you used to host your own staff, so he took over all of that now?
00:31:21 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, they, so they're not using any of the hosting that I had on the, for the tea before, because the way that we're selling the tea is, is with an existing offer that they have on, on click bank, and it's, it's called a new, new body, it's a, it's like a health and wellness fitness offer for people, loose fat, build muscle like anything, because that's John's back. ground. And so the upsell for the T is going to be shown to those buyers initially to solve the traffic issue of not having to go out and build an ad campaign to start so we can get cash flowing in that then we can reinvest back into coal traffic and that type of thing. So the click bank is handling the payment processing and then I guess the pages, the pages are not loading or they're not floating quickly enough for whatever technical reason is going on with this, they keep using the word Microsoft server. So maybe it's a server inside their hosting. I don't know what they're using.
00:33:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, or the other way around hosting on a server because every site that we have is on a server somewhere.
00:33:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right, right. So. Okay, then the. So those are the main two pieces attack the clipping payment processing in their hosting slash server that are in place and there's an issue with the hosting server. then after after the purchase happens, we're using ship station to handle the fulfillment. to, uh, to the folks up in, in Rochester.
00:34:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, just to adjust an upsell to their stuff. Mm hmm. Okay.
00:34:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. I'm click bank and they, and they have, um, you know, five to 7,000 people come through that funnel every month. So it's a, it's a good. Um, you know, it's not a huge, but it's a decent stream of traffic to put this offer in front of, and, uh, for the purposes of testing and acquiring customers, you know.
00:34:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, it depends on how much you want to be involved in, and what you want to know because your bottlenecked by this. It's not your primary business. Um, I were going to be involved at all, I would want I know, where is it hosted? Why are you using, like, is this a personal server? Is this, I mean, because there are, you know, mom and pop shop servers and hosting services. And, but you didn't specify that in a contract. And any of that type of stuff, and it behooves them to get their stuff figured out, but maybe just asking questions and making sure they're not operating in dinosaur ways, they've got optimized. And having a, you know, not a, I'm demanding things, but let's have a talk and see if you can do some better things, choose a better hosting provider, whatever, I don't know. But yeah, I mean, server issues are real, especially when you're not using a streamlined one that has a huge team that has lots of different servers that you can go to.
00:35:58 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Well, I mean, I spoke to him yesterday, spoke to Jim yesterday and, you know, I mean, I could tell he's in it like he sounded just like just done with the whole thing and ready to to move and get it fixed. he he promised me an update by Thursday, by tomorrow, and I'll I'll text him if I don't want hear from him. You know, I I just have been, I've kind of given a longer leash to them, I guess.
00:36:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
pacing comes in because there's just something you can't predict. and there was a big learning curve and then it's that's where priority comes into because if this isn't your bread and butter yeah but you got this existing asset and your priority was don't lose the asset but don't be buried by it don't have to do the marketing basically you tap into my existing resources and I get paid there's no reason not to let it take a pace that is chill as long as you can tell it's being moved along stuff is getting done maybe it's not the way you would have wanted to but 80-20 is you're barely touching it it should still end up paying you you just have to get set up but the advising you know I don't know how old they are but if you're dealing with a man and his grown son it's been around for a while probably little bit up there um yeah yeah and also I think yeah John's in his 60s and Jim is like early
00:38:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
really for you. So he's, he's around my age and, you know, they, uh, Jim is like his, um, his operations person basically. So he works with his dad on his office. Hey, who's dad?
00:38:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who's son?
00:38:21 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Uh, John, John is the dad.
00:38:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Jim is the son.
00:38:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, it's definitely moving, uh, slower than I expected, but I also, I do, I do feel like it's going to get solved here real soon. Like I talked to him yesterday about, you know, I'd really like to get this off for a live next month. Uh, do you have to knew anything? Is, well, I, I purchased, um, bunch of tea for inventory. So, you know, that's a cost I've already made and invested in, and I brought that up like 10 days ago to them when reached out, like, let's get a timeline, like, I've done so much I've invested, and that really got their attention and a lot of apologies and that kind of thing.
00:39:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are costs split, do they have to pay for half of that also?
00:39:37 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
They don't have any cash, so I took that on and I get, like, all the profit goes to pay me back off the top from the first sales.
00:39:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A couple more things real quick. Can you, so something to maybe think about is use this as an exclusive offer. Hey, we had some tech issues and we just bought inventory, so we got to move this stuff to make sure whatever. Use that because that's real. Tap into that, maybe offer a special discount, but maybe it's not really like it's the price is built into it. So it's framed that way. Maybe ask them to email offer a little bit more aggressively than they would.
00:40:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's a potential thing.
00:40:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or if that tea goes bad and it doesn't get used, it comes out of their cuts when the money does come. Just some things to think about.
00:40:45 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Yeah, mean, we we all went into like in when I agreed to. To make that investment in John was up front from the very beginning from the very first call of like. He doesn't have any money to put into this, and he's had some financial struggles. Well, that's another reason to double check on the server issue, because maybe he's cutting corners, he shouldn't be cutting and being foresighted about it. That's true.
00:41:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because especially with an older school guy, that's possible. So, you know, and that's kind of affect you, something to think about.
00:41:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, for sure.
00:41:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think it figured out there's a huge dynamic difference, though, between that and how you started with other people, especially an older gentleman, that, you know, the dynamic should be your ultimately the boss. And it started with, you know, I want this 33, no.
00:41:54 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I've got 50, they each have 25.
00:41:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's probably not really anything else to talk about that particular thing, right?
00:42:11 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I don't think so. It's just moving slowly and about connected with Jim tomorrow to get an update.
00:42:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll let you go. So with this guy working with the lead company in political conservative space, that, did we talk about that? Was that part of the, you were talking about a consulting job and making an offer? And was that what you were referencing?
00:42:45 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, this is, the company is American Target advertising. Been around for decades. Found a by guy named Richard Bigory who back in the. late 60s like he's an older dude and he is like he invented like a new category of political fundraising and that's back in the late 60s raising money for Nixon and people like that and and it's it's really kind of burst a lot of the way that political fundraising is is done today I know him through through Brian because he was in Brian's the mastermind and his right hand is a lady named Kathleen Patton who I know really well but they they recently hired a like a director of digital marketing or something like that and she her name's Marcy she's in she went through the over-delivered boot camp And that we just finished yesterday. And I just heard her mention on a call that they were gonna be hiring, looking to hire an email, a copywriter. So I just sent her an email. was like, hey, I heard you say this, are you looking for full time, time? She said, part time. So I just said, I just basically told her I'd love to put my hat in the ring, told her I knew all the people she knows. And also just shared like, I do personally feel compelled to, like I do want the Republicans to win in November. And I want to, I would love to make a contribution to that. And that's all genuine and legit. shared that with her. Cause that's stuff I usually don't share with anybody. Yeah. so in Kathleen and I have talked politics a whole lot, and so I center a whole bunch of writing samples of stuff that I've done, and they're going to reach out to schedule a call heard from her yesterday that they were going to be reviewing everything and getting it to me.
00:45:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a few things I want to point out. Think about, ask about whatever. Yeah. Number one, it's while, but we talked about the power of network and how feeding that and nurturing that brings things around when, whether it be political and having those types of allies, there's going to be a day where we're all going to have their band arms one way or another. First, we physically, whatever it's going to happen, who we know, and the the level of relationships we have when that happens for people, whether it's large scale or small community scale, something is inevitable. Some type of civil upheaval is gonna happen. So that's one thing. To just getting to have a contribution in the way things do, we have no right to complain about anything when we won't do what's in front of us, you know. So there's that, you having the agora experience, just having an awareness of how agora emails, how they market, things like that, and how that impacts politics, because there's definitely a lot of involving there, is useful and beneficial. one thing I would do is change the way you ask the question about it and frame it. And now I'll take you back to blue collar worker full time of hard time, irrelevant surgeon. What are the results that you want? What are the results that you're looking for? Now we're talking about value, but when you say full-time part-time, you're automatically putting yourself in an hourly type position, evaluating your value per hour. You don't want that ever. You want to be evaluated based on your results. So we have an existing email list, we bring about $x in sales, we're looking to make this list. This is how often we email. This is our attrition rate on the email list. Like get data, don't ask about full-time part-time, just ask about what is your current email situation.
00:47:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Can I ask you some questions first?
00:47:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'd love to have a conversation with you about this. Email is something that I have a proven truck record of and making a significant lift in sales. Bye. multiples, you know, speaking in language like that, which, you know, people, people can use and use and they do, but that's true for you. And as you dig into it and ask the numbers, you can get that. But start positioning yourself immediately. Start leveraging the words and the conversation that you use immediately. You are not the hourly worker, you are not the employee, you are not the grunt worker, you are always consultants and experts, even if you're doing the labor.
00:48:37 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I take that point. I think my, my counter to that would be that this is not like a, I mean, small company in the sense of like, it doesn't have thousands of employees, but I know it's been around for a long time. It's kind of a corporate mentality. quality. And I will showcase all the things that you're talking about on a call with them. And at the same time, I know that if I feel like if I led with that with them, that it would be skipping, I'm trying to get my foot in the door. So I know they're thinking in terms of full-time or part-time. They say we want a full-time person. would have, I would know that like, well that I can't commit to that because what they're thinking is I want somebody 40 hours a week. so knowing that they're just looking for a part-time freelancer, that's helpful because I know that and what I said is like I'd love to have a conversation with you about what you're looking for and see if I can help. So I'm just trying to get the conversation in that conversation. Once I get it, then, you know, I can shift their understanding of what this is and what the potential is by the questions I asked. I take your point like I see what you're saying.
00:50:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I see what you're saying with the foot and the door. I still think that you may be reframing it in terms of what kind of volume are you looking for? Because that answers your full-time part-time and maybe they don't know it, which in and of itself is a signal because even if it's a good cause, you only have so much energy and time bandwidth. So if it's a poorly managed business or if the arrangement is not leveraged, even if it's a good cause, you might be signing up for or more than you really want to give and can give at this time so that's just something to think about not so and this goes back to you and it's been a while i don't know actually if you and i have ever talked about it but good better best i'm familiar with the concepts so the thing is you have finite yeses if you say yes to good things that's good if you say yes to great things that's great but here's the deal if you fill up with good and great you don't or good better best good and better you don't have room for best so you know do you want the best and and here's the other thing is sometimes we get these things that put something on our radar that never was on our radar before and sometimes that's all we needed so maybe it's all right this isn't really what I've got the bandwidth for right now but now I know I want to put my skills towards helping the Republicans win or or you know what I'm just going to volunteer this or I will do this which isn't everything you want but here's what I'll do here's the price that I'll charge you and here's why I think it's a no-brainer and you could take it or leave it but still put it inside of your terms don't worry about foot in the door because either they're going to vibe with your energy and the mission and the fact that you're not taking advantage of them but that you're also compartmentalizing and going okay but this is this is what I can this is the limit to what I can bring today um but then just and the other the other part of the pitch is but once I get inside and see what you're doing what I'll offer for free is a consultation for optimization and and just what I
00:53:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
see about improvement.
00:53:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you can find where in the conversation to have that or not have that. But remember that even in these things, when you want to get in your foot in the door, remember your level of expertise, that's all. And that there's finite time and energy.
00:53:22 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, for sure. Yeah, I see that.
00:53:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But then go chase the right thing that serves that purpose if you want it because it is an election year. And you do have major skills. So anyway, okay. You still have time.
00:53:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay.
00:53:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would really love to know about the boot camp, how that went.
00:53:47 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know, this is over the boot camp. This the only second time we've done it. I don't love it. Yeah. And it went only at 30. people sign up. so I was emailing with Brian yesterday because he was like, on the next boot camp, I want to add more of his ads to the slides and things like that because they're just basic slides. our response to him was like, yeah, we can do that. But I think the bigger challenge is like figuring out how to sell this. So because we had 60 people sign up on the first one. And, you know, like, if I, if I'm not the target market for the real, real boot camp, like if I had bought that and gone through it, I wouldn't be happy because it's, I mean, it's really kind of about principles. like Brian, Brian's thing is not teaching the, the nitty-gritty pretty stuff. Like he's big picture and he talks in terms of like, you know, like the closest to like a tactical thing he talks about is like when you're developing your first order, always have the second order in mind. And that's a helpful like concept that he can riff on. But that's like an example of like the most tactical that he gets. His wheelhouse is just not in really getting into things that you walk away and you're like, oh man, that's amazing. But at the same time, the reason I say I'm not the target market is because there are people in the boot camp who will say, wow, that was amazing. And they loved it.
00:55:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so, I mean, that's like listening to Socrates or Marcus Aurelius you know there's philosophy and some people's brains don't think like that and they haven't had those teachers so that value is huge because the tactics mean nothing if you don't understand the philosophy behind it and I'm with you I want tactics I'm full of philosophy you know but so segmentation first of all of the list and just kind of being able to figure out who is philosophical and who's tactile tactical and being able to serve them more because whoever's you know soaking up the philosophy more that serves a purpose and you can correlate a monetary benefit to that because it changes how you operate because it You know, like you said, principles, um, so, but, but if there's a person who's looking for tactics, that's going to be so annoying and frustrating because there's nothing super actionable or clearly defined. so, um, something to think about is, is there a way and it could be really short and you could use AI for this. So, have AI just go through all the transcripts and say pull out all the principles. Okay. um, do you have suggestions for tactics, for executing these principles inside of a business? Give an example for this type of business, this type of business, this size of business, this financial, you know, monetary thing type of business, and use it to put maybe a little bit more on it. So, um, And then maybe you can just sell that with what was there plus the outline and maybe some supplemental videos that you do as a not a live thing, but a prerecorded course. See what kind of feedback you get on it, maybe drive traffic just to that and not make it super expensive. But now you've captured all of your existing stuff, your repurposing and not doing good. This is what wasn't. Get some reviews on it. then if you only do a live one once or twice a year, then it gets more energy. You kind of bottleneck it so people have to build up and like look forward to it. And it's kind of a launch style instead, which I think would energize Brian. And you know, that's the whole kind of thing, which also reduces how many times you even have to think about doing it. It just starts like that.
00:59:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, the AI thing is a good idea to be able to see what opportunity might be there to make it a little more tactical because that also helps with selling it and being able to talk about what they're going to get. I was about this today during my workout, it's like for Titans, I'm both the visionary and the integrator and I see, like with Tim, like if I were to propose an idea to Tim, it's like hey, I'm going to do this bootcamp and it's going to, because Tim's got a book coming out, right? So, hey, we're going to do this bootcamp around your book. like, Tim would, would put the thing, an outline of the whole thing together. And, and we would get on a call and we would go through that and we would refine it. And Brian is not going to do that. So if anything is going to happen, it's going to be needed to create it. And so in my mind, I think like, well, break through advertising is one thing, because it's, it's an investment, like it's a brand that's going to outlive Brian. And I've created, so I'm motivated to like, to create around that brand.
01:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's tactical by design.
01:00:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
And it's tactical. Yeah. to liver. You know, that's, that's going to be a, that's not our brand beyond Brian and, and he's, it's, I just always felt like I'm pulling Brian. to, you know, whatever you want to call success after his career in boardroom. And he would tell you that too. So, there's a little bit of a, I feel like I want to protect my time with the over-delivered boot camp of like, in and knock this thing out of the park.
01:01:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you get any conversions yet?
01:01:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, yeah. We've added four people into TXL from the 38. The deadline is Sunday. I think we'll probably end up with 15. So, like, that right there is, that's my motivation is like, okay, if this is a good way to get people into TXL.
01:01:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, let's put a number on that. Yeah. you. Let's say you got. 15 people in.
01:02:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
What does that work to you? Uh, 15 people, you know, tell you. Uh, people.
01:02:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Calculate it right in front of you if you want it.
01:02:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
What's that?
01:02:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
there's a calculator right in front of you if you want it on that computer.
01:02:19 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I'm doing it right now.
01:02:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got my calculator up. My brain would go, uh, I can't do math on the band when somebody's looking at me.
01:02:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So that, if we get 15, that's, uh, 5,400 to me.
01:02:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now roughly how much time do you think it spends on it?
01:02:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Uh, the, the, uh, there were six calls, hour and a half.
01:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Include promotions and anything else.
01:02:56 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, this time I just, I just ran the same email. We did on the first one.
01:03:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:03:02 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I didn't rewrite those. I mean, I want to have calls six of them, so six times. So nine, nine hours for the calls and probably another five hours.
01:03:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Want to know that hourly rate roughly? Three hundred and eighty five dollars an hour.
01:03:31 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
01:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, for everything else that I know that you do, I don't think that you average a lot higher than that. Even with your consulting.
01:03:42 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right.
01:03:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So now the other thing is how much you enjoy the time and how tedious it is and that type of thing. Now that's a big factor. And if you can do things that you enjoy more for roughly the equivalent, you know. amount of time so but that's another reason too and and because you know Ryan has help issues that come up that sometimes things have to get rescheduled he's definitely got a lot of things that that can that come up every year there's something he just had another surgery on his heart oh last month lesson so anyway so taking that and figuring out what you can do to optimize it and then making it an evergreen just pre-recording thing and then if you want to having maybe it's once a year over delivered bootcamp and you pre-sell you know and it's like embedded into everything else like at the bottom of the email p s p s that type of thing offering everything hey we're doing this later and then closer to it do a ramp up advertising thing and now that changes everything the energy should be really hot You can have the tactics, can have all the pretty graphics that make Brian excited about it and really make it a big production, which helps with the brand, which I think matters to Brian. And it's over delivering like it's built to over deliver. He can have other gifts like because you guys can kind of, if you're pre selling it and people are buying it. And you can tell him like if you can't make it live, here's the recordings and you get all of these bonuses. Plus here's the best action bonuses if you sign up between this month and this month because we're going to build up for a whole year, that kind of thing. You can really make it a production that helps him feel like he's keeping his brand live and he's feeding his brand. This isn't Jean's stuff, this is his. And so it's kind of an homage. It mitigizes how much work you put into it. You get to build the engine which you love to do, right? engine is the thing. The demo comes duplicatable. for be a bootcamp if you wanted to do it so you can have be a live versus not but since we know that that really is where most of accelerator members come from and they got to play with that a little bit but anyway you are primed to optimize all of this for multiple reasons brian's health yeah um you're you're just simply doing this everywhere and you've got other options so you don't have to be you know he he doesn't have you over a barrel so to speak you know um there's there's so much that's evolved and on top of that AI can really help take existing content that you've gotten over and over again and go what are the best parts of this and really give you some some tools so that even if you're doing it yourself you're not really you know what i mean i get chatgbt4o changed everything
01:07:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know, actually, I think what I would do, because I'm pretty sure, can't you, you can upload videos into chat GPT. I haven't done it yet.
01:07:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've taken video transcripts, but I wouldn't be surprised if you can now.
01:07:15 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you can't, if not, can get a transcript of it, but I think I would take the recordings from this bootcamp and say, listen to this lesson. And, and they help me come up with, you know, specific tactics that, that would go along with it. That I think would be, because when I think about over-delivered, because I've read the book and it's like, like, it, it just, it's, it requires, for me, just a lot of mental energy, like, to make the connection from the philosophical to, like, how do we make this real?
01:07:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you know what else you could do? Is you could build a couple of avatars Say so chat tpt first of all here's all kinds of my Kent called content. Here's my call recordings Here are things that I've written okay learn me First of all profile me. What do you know about me? Okay? me tell you some other things about how I feel about business what annoys me what I like when I'm looking for help This is what I'm looking for here We're gonna build an avatar around me and people like me so that if I'm serving people like me I know how to talk to them and then we're gonna profile Brian's type of person that likes a philosophy. So profile both of them okay, so then you give them the Him it the the over-delivered PDF okay Tell it what you love about it What was good? But tell them what's tedious for you why it's tedious how it's tedious if you could fix it how you would fix it and give an Example like this is written blah blah blah blah blah blah blah all I wanted to say is
01:09:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
this.
01:09:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want a tactical executable thing. For example, this. Okay, now I want you to go through the whole rest of the book. And I want you to pull out five specific tactics that you think are the most leverageable for any business owner. Okay, first, tell me what they are. Let me approve them. Okay, I approve these. Now, I want you to give me the simplest while also being understandable, comprehensible suggestion for tactical implementation in a business. And I want you to give me three examples and turn them into anecdotes starting with one of those tactics. You could probably improve it, but most of that will be actionable all by itself. You can make the over-deliver, you know, basically what, um, BAM is, you know, for BA, something like that, but it it's for you, but guaranteed other people want that. So the pitch to Brian is like, look, not everybody thinks the same way, but the value is still there. Their brains just operate differently. Let's give them this. And so yeah, take all the videos, take the PDF, and then direct it on a mental process, you know, type of vibe avatar.
01:10:34 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
01:10:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think about even exciting too, and take the tediousness out of it, because it's happening so fast, and you get to watch happen and you get to watch it go, I didn't do that. I just directed it, and you whip it all out there. So that could put some energy back into you around something that I felt like it's been draining.
01:10:58 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I mean, the nice thing about the bootcamp is like, I don't have to teach it, and you know, it's like it's a low-ask of me in terms of delivery. I also think that part of, and I share this with Brian's, do think a contributing factor to the number of signups is that we held it in July, because the last time we held it in April. And so I suggested to him, it's like, I think that we should just plan out a bootcamp cadence for the year. So Q1, we do a BA bootcamp, Q2, we do an over-delivered bootcamp, then Q4, we do another BA bootcamp. And we just have those on the calendar.
01:11:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or end of Q3, like, so end of September, where people have been in school, all the college kids are in school, everybody's in school now, and they've had a little time to, you know, because you've got an end. In the country, a huge amount of people start school in August and then September and then the colleges. by the end of September, 1st week of October, you're not in holiday mode and everybody has settled down and starting to fall into their fall routine and I don't think people take enough advantage of that particular time of the year of availability mentally and energetically financially, we recovered the, you know, working during the summer, spending all the expenses there, kind of thing.
01:12:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So anyway, something to take into account. That's true. All right.
01:12:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
got to take my dogs, take your dogs, Hank and, Hank and Hattie, we've got this like calming medicine.
01:12:50 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
We started giving to Hattie for the groupers.
01:12:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. How's that work? What is it?
01:12:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
We have it. It's a. a lot lazza roll or something like that it's It just mellows around we would do it around if there's gonna be fireworks Cuz she gets real nervous with that, but Yeah, we gave her a pill If you find out what the details are and let me know cuz I have a dog that cries every time he gets in the car drives me Bonkers bonkers.
01:13:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, I will let you go. It's so good to catch up with you You just maybe not be such a stranger for a month maybe yeah, no promises You know I wrote on that sheet a couple times couple I saw once I Know once this month and it was last week All right, take care of yourself and I'll talk to you soon. Love you. Bye. too.

> 2024-09-17T20:00:00Z 00:00:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hey, Patrick. 00:00:05 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) How are you doing? Good. How are you? 00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Good. I'm trying to get on my windows up in real quick. saw you sent your assignment. I haven't got it yet. Microsoft. I'm gonna move this over to Google Docs for myself. I won't even let me copy it. Oh, dude. I don't want to go through all those steps. Um, yeah. I'll just look at it here, I guess. Um, how long did it take you to do this? 00:01:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I had a new guy that came, I basically did this with him for, believe, the other week. Yeah, because I was just explaining what we do, so I kind of already did it with him, so I just had to put it on in writing. 00:01:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, do you feel that there was anything useful about it when you did the exercise? Did you think anything? where's it just recording? 00:01:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) This is what it is. I mean, it's always good to know. Like, just get some cases to make sure that you know exactly what steps need to be done on each case. It's easy to like skip one and then. 00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like the health insurance stuff for the distributions are out like it'll come up because accounting needs those to process the distributions but I mean we did we do so many cases like you pretty much already know what needs to be done yeah and I only have two other people on my team so it's not like the tasks are broken up to like four different people yeah my gosh I hate I have a Microsoft account but I just never use it I have a PDF I might ask you to send it some other way because I actually have like three accounts I've got my school account because I'm a student I've got one for my mission and I've got my personal fun and they don't make logging in easy like you can't just anyway yeah Uh, yeah, if you would mind just copying pasting it, even into an email is fine. Oh, that should do it actually, let's see. I'm gonna try to get it signed in. Oh my gosh, always it makes me like reset my password. Chirping, oh gosh. That an allergy is my eyeball sting, sting, allergies suck. don't know you have allergies, but they suck. My little sister doesn't have a little. that's you so lucky. Everything makes my body just go bleh. right you emailing that to me yeah thank you let me open up see what i'm going to do i will make a new spreadsheet is what i think i'll we need a lot of like copy and paste in light bro calm down thank you what the heck Oh, good. Okay. I was like, it wasn't letting me crowd it. Okay, so I want to do this until I want to do it. I'm going to share my screen. So I want, that's everyone. And then I'm going to Actually, so introduction call. I'm just going to kind of do this stuff together. Um, because it'll make it easier to kind of sort and track this time. Did I do that right? I'll see does this and does them the best. Okay. So nobody is assigned to that. Oh, so he never mind. It's just in a different row. Um, sending defendant insurance. 00:06:28 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Cynthia does that. Okay. 00:06:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Sometimes the formatting like breaks in between things. Like this. Okay. Cynthia, he does it best. The job doing us by the way and thank you for that. That'd be helpful. Well, she and Cynthia are able to do the same. Okay. I'll see limits, other policy limits level is that or same level. Never mind. Okay. I'm trying to like fry in my brain. I got like four hours of sleep and not for good reason. I mean, kind of it's tucked in my sister and we're ridiculous cackling into like one o'clock in the morning, like 12-year-old, but making red jokes like 10-year-old. 00:07:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It's plenty of to wake up in the morning. 00:07:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, 540. So that's who worked out so well for me. I'm a little punch drunk, Patrick. But it's okay. She had to get up at four o'clock. 00:07:54 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) She works at a methadone clinic. 00:07:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She's a nurse and she has a 45-minute drive. I have to, when she comes home, she's going to be dead driving on these windy roads. I kind of, I know kind of like, I do feel bad about that, depending on what the call is regarded. Right. See. Soon. And now this is tedious. I'm just doing this and that seems always full of the time, but it's not because formatting it will just do some things I want to get into kind of creating a structure for time. Okay. And this will be better for kind of visualizing it and making a correlation to case-in-case volume. My daughters' birds are going nuts, it's got parakeets, okay, let's see, so introduction call. now bear with me because systems optimization, all of this is a case-by-case kind of process, right? So there are fundamental things that I look for and ways at approaching it, but it gets customized is for multiple reasons, team, time, and also the person who's running the system or the people who are running the system. So, for example, I know you don't want to read books. There are, you're not the only one. I use this example because it's the first thing that comes to my mind of, like, Mark, I wanted to have him do a gratitude practice just to help him be in a more positive mindset because it works really well. He's like, Tina, he tried for a few weeks. didn't really push back. He just really didn't do it. He's like, it's not really my thing. I said, that's you got to tell me that because, you know, just because I suggested doesn't mean I think I know all the things and it has to be one way. It has to be the way that you will do it, the way that you can buy into it. If you don't buy into it, you're not going to do it. You're not going here. Continuing client. Elsie does this and does it best. Okay, we'll go back here. I can tie. Does it best? Okay, and client doctor. gonna guess that's also Elsie. Patrick and Elsie depending on what the calls regarding. Oh wait, I put that in there. I'm gonna just didn't get it actually there. Now this is why putting things in a good format to begin with, which I did not specify as far as she might have actually, but it's okay. Just because later. So Um, preparing demand letters, why I know you just have to do that. That's Mark wants you to do that. Right. 00:12:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Uh, all the attorneys right there demands. 00:12:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. We just had the conversation screw looking at AI demand writing services, negotiating and finalizing new settlements, doctor reductions and distributions. Now, I know that at least the distributions can be done by someone else. What about not necessarily on your team that you have somebody on your team that can do this, but these things could be done theoretically by someone else, right? Doesn't have a turning. Okay. At knowing who's on your team and definitely don't think anybody else would be. That's what is that? So one, two, four, what did I do? Yes, property damage. Copy and pasting would not be that difficult. Patrick, right, I'm just not. OK, all right, um, let me go into little bit a real question. Do not update the password. That's how I get locked out a bit of I could use. There's some stupid things. See. Is that this one? If I mess this up, I'm taking that out to you and I think it might be just one refresh. I the last 60 days or not. Actually, I think I want to know I want reset the parts. How would you be by attorney? All of the cases like attorney are matters by team. And then team Patrick. So you have 114. Oh. Then, let's set up 22 negotiations. What's it? 00:15:10 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It's one we like to disperse the money, but we keep a little bit, as we're still waiting on something. Like a health insurance link to pay, but we can distribute the client funds and take our portion without having to like wait for it. 00:15:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm to do one more thing. So, Mark just took some of your cases right and put them somewhere else. 00:15:53 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, we saw some things too. 00:15:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hank, right, okay. How many? I have a number of that skewed, so let me text Marco because I need him to give you guys a report and I keep forgetting to ask Mark. Hey, when are you going to get me a report that the attorneys can look at with all the stats I asked about? Like weeks ago. I need a saucy face. Whoops. Come on, man. I'm dictating. Okay, so I need that because this should have a correlation to the closed date. But it'll be interesting to, let's see how we made that correlation. Again, I know that it seems like a very scattered frame, but this is the time that we spend creating the process and kind of putting structure on where the time goes is worth it. And it is kind of, I don't know, not just like it's disjointed, like there's trying to wrap around everything. So I'll see, I'll see. Cynthia, Cynthia ordering final medical records, initial documents, sending different insurance inquiries, um, and or policy limits. I also need people's time reports. okay. So Cynthia works in the office or at home or, okay. They're both in the office. And she's there every day. 00:18:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Cynthia, I'll see why it's a week is home. 00:18:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I'm just going to put nuts for myself. I'm just getting like overall operational structure so that I wrap my head around it. So do you think that you have a ballpark average estimation of how long these particular tasks take average, right? Obviously, there will be outliers, some that go very quick, some go very long. If I put a column here, do you think that you could give that? 00:19:42 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Is that just like property damage, like let's say just for one client, it could be like over the period of like two, three weeks to get it done? 00:19:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so here's what we'll do because time has to be We'll go to complete, like so, or phase, because I kind of like these different phases, and then um, estimated time, um, like, minutes, hours spent, like this task type, right? So, like, how, ordering the policy limits, I mean, like anything where you've got to call insurance, sometimes those calls, like, take a while, right? chasing clients down, and so I know that that's not going to have a real number two, but it'll give me some kind of ballpark, and it'll help, it'll just help in the mental process of kind of creating this, and then trying to figure out basically what is the best type of flow throughout world. the day in terms of like blocking types of tasks. And then also looking at it and going, how often do we need to go through this cycle for all the cases that you have so that we're not waiting two or three weeks before we check on the next thing? Does that make sense? Because I don't think right now that you have anything where you do that, like where you look at a checklist, basically, and everybody just mentally goes through a checklist. The problem with that is we are statistically human beings are terrible self reporters. So if you mentally are saying you went through the thing, right, you don't check on it, you don't look at something, we're going to forget or assume the other thing is, it's like the bystander effect that that we assume that somebody else has done the thing. As as Especially if there's a thing where there's, there's two people who do it. So I'll see in Cynthia. I'm like, oh, well, I'll see mine is done then or whatever. So if we have a list and we just kind of go through it and and you've got a list of your cases, checking off whatever things are done. And then whatever stage that we're in now. Do you have something like that in Lidified that has all of these statuses. Yeah, I didn't think so. Okay. And you don't have anything that that you could just go through and say it's in this section. It's in this status. It's in this status. Right. And can some of these be happening simultaneously? Yeah. Okay. So that's another thing that I want to know. So, um, um, can happen. currently it so we'll do that and I'm going to let's see yeah okay so let's see the concurrent first introduction calls obviously it's first thing one of the things can be happening whoa at the same time let's go down that row confirming coverages and liability I feel like that's kind of its own thing that has to happen first and then true it has to happen so none of these like these are all standalone right and then yeah assessing property damage you can probably be working on that while you're setting up for treatment yep okay so this is not for let's see let's say that can happen I'm going do number three for sending defendant insurance inquiry request or D&D. That can also happen, right? Same time-ish. You don't have to wait for setting up treatment and property damage to do sending defendant insurance inquiry or do you? 00:24:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) So typically you wouldn't be doing the treatment if you're sending those insurance and because basically we're trying to see if there's any insurance. 00:24:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so this goes before treatment? 00:24:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:24:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so I'm going to cut these, bring them down here, drag everything up, change this. Okay, let's go through the order then first in case there's anything else that can't be done before the thing above it. Can you hear these first? Yeah, I got to make sure the doors are closed next time. 00:25:33 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Okay. It looks like no, it's in order. 00:25:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, now it's an order. Okay, so one, two, the defendant. Insurance inquire request or DMV insurance chart request. So that will disregard the numbers. Actually, I'm going to go like this. One. Hey, that's not what was supposed to work, dude. Appreciate that. Okay. So any defendant insurance, um, is there anything else that happens with this or is that like preliminary that has to be done before we get to the next steps. 00:26:29 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Um, I guess you can do the intro call and stuff or it would already be done. 00:26:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, so do we need to change this order again? 00:26:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) No, I mean, typically the intro call would be done at that point. The intro call is like the first thing. So. 00:26:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So do we send the this before confirming or are they. 00:27:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It kind of does in techno can't be so like you do the intro call and you know, you they don't have the defense insurance information Actually number four order initial documents as police reports you would put that before setting defendant insurance thing Okay Could Since it's both Cynthia, okay, what else So ordering policy limits medical referrals You can do those simultaneously Okay 00:28:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) five, six. I'm just going to do this together, five, six. Okay. Um, what else? 00:28:24 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) seven, eight, nine and six can all be done together. 00:28:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) six, seven, eight, two, one, two, five, ten. Wait, now that's right. Oh, I'm thrown off because the rest of that. Oh, that's why I'm sorry. Never mind. This is definitely its own thing, own thing, own thing, own own thing, right? property damage weight. 00:29:12 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Property damage you can do with five, six, three. 00:29:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Then can three be done with five and six also. 00:29:55 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:29:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, because what I mean when I. say done with it is like basically it's not contingent, like you can't, you don't have to wait for anything. Okay, just want to make sure we're on the same page. Okay. So, do you feel like most of the work is done linearly, like people thinking that it's this step, then this step, rather than here's all the things that we could be doing for this case right now, what do you think is more likely that is happening? 00:30:38 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Probably like step by step. 00:30:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So, just this right here would probably could probably really help the flow of the cases. Knowing how many cases you have now, here's what I don't know is how long it takes and how much waiting there is and how good it is, but. What I would guess is that there's a lot of time people are just not really working super hard and at stuff and sitting there just thinking about the cases maybe and just glancing at the records and not really pushing it forward. What do you think? Do you think that because obviously I'm not, I don't want anybody. I'm making a wild assessment. 00:31:30 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I'm sure there's like times in the day where it's just like things slow down. Obviously, happens with me too. But I do think like some of these things like policy limits, like that takes like five minutes. You know, so it's like, let's say you're, or you just got off a long call and you don't want like take a call right now or something. You don't want to make a call. could like do the policy limit real quick. It takes five minutes. You just didn't put the info. 00:32:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So here's where I'm getting out with this. And this is my hard- slide that people don't really like, but you'll have no problem with your team. don't know. And and also you're kind of laid back. So if you're not looking at it this way, but my guess would be, especially based off of the conversations I've had with Mark about how things go, is that there are probably several gaps throughout the day, every day of the week, where not much is getting done and could be getting done. Because if you have 116 cases, and most of them are in a status of needing to get something, there are probably 116 calls that could be made somewhere in the team throughout the day. they're hourly, right? You're not, right? Or are you hourly? No, but they are, right? Um, I would bet that all the billable time is not used very effectively or, um, I would just bet that there was a lot of just about 10% level effort. Being put, and this isn't talking about your team statistically. I'm talking about people in general. And I think part of the nature of it is not necessarily laziness or unwillingness to work. I think it is the volume of things to do and the mental effort. And I think it's a lot. I would not do this job. This would be tedious. I would hate it. But, you know, that's me, I didn't go into this. but what I think could happen is if we work through this for a little while, go through it with Lorenz and get an idea, I would love to see you do is kind of create some structure and say, look, here's the list of cases that we have, even if you put it in a spreadsheet and if you're using Microsoft Office, you probably have a sweet lot account, right, with Microsoft. So, it's secure. Everything stays on your own drive, stays, you know, where only sweet lot people could get to it. You could check it with Lidify. You could have some other kind of identifier. don't know if Lidify doesn't have, like, case IDs. does matter IDs. Okay. that would get really confusing. I feel like I'll ask Mark if we could do this. And based off of other work that we've done together, I feel like he would be okay with that. And I'll show him this and see what he thinks. But honestly, I think that this could be really useful across all of Sweet Law. Because just the mental taxing effort of trying to track all the different, like you only have 160, but 116 is a lot. And some of the other teams have 300, you're going to have more. And whatever state that they're in, somebody needs to be checking to see, is it waiting on us? Is it waiting on them? If it's waiting on them, one was the last contact point. If it's more than 24 hours or two business days or whatever, you deem appropriate that we do follow up. So just going through a checklist of here's the things that have to get done. Here's the list of cases. Here was the last touch. So then there were be another column that's okay so like we would have this as a checklist while people just kind of get used to it like oh yeah I could be doing this here's all the things that have to be done and there's a spreadsheet with all the matters on it and then so I really want to see what you guys look at letify what do you do and letify what do you guys record and letify what do you use it for everything like the whole case is on there yeah so all the notes um so like you could go in here like click the matter yeah so this is what I see when I open the case so there's highlight activity can I click on activity I mean I can but so it'll show the last time somebody We touched it, but not necessary. I tried to call and nothing happened, right? 00:37:07 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Um, you could pull like left a voicemail still pending, whatever. 00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. timeline. No. How would you, um, like, no, what's the, what's going on? Yeah. What's the last thing that happened? 00:37:32 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Who, who touched it last? So, on the left side, this big, like, paragraph, how you do it there first. Okay. 00:37:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, yeah. So these are all the notes. 00:37:49 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) These are, they use this side for like, made, like bigger points. Like she's got an injection. So I want to know like that. And then on the right side, the, um, the activity. But if you scroll down, these are more like calls, email the sent out, things like that. 00:38:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) OK, so let's you look at both. OK, let's just let's just run through these real quick and look at something. So this was last touch yesterday. We're going to go like boom, boom through a lot, really quickly. Last touch three months ago. OK, tell me what we are going look at to go. Why was this only the last note three months ago? 00:38:37 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Can you go to the conversations? I know he's still treating, so we could sound like a follow-up text just to keep it on the I loop on what's going on with the case, but he's still in treatment. 00:39:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So, um, do you know when treatment is supposed to be over? 00:39:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Um, can you scroll up to the damages? 00:39:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And tell me like, scroll over here and then the far left. Oh, here. Click on it. 00:39:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:39:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) This doesn't total it for you, huh? But it should, because you are trying to hit policy limits, right? 00:39:47 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It does on the other page. But this. Yeah. Okay. Right. 00:39:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There are total damages. And. And where does it say what the policy limits are here? 00:40:04 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, if you go to insurance on it right there. So it's 150. 00:40:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I'm 50,000. 00:40:16 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:40:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) OK, so that's not likely. would think to hit a policy limit. So then, um, um, I'm not sure how much more I'm to do under this. Yeah, so it again, I know this much, right? So I'm just asking questions. How would you know? I mean, OK, you know that he is in treatment, but if there's no contact for three months, how do you know that they're still going? 00:41:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) you know that they haven't so is there a time period that a person can stop going for treatment that affects the case yeah more so in the beginning like if they don't go to treatment like a month and it's like the big red flag but not later it kind of depends but like if they're waiting for a surgery or something it's obviously going to take some time to schedule it and stuff like that but so as long as the initial doctor's assessment is there that has said these are all the things that they need they kind of have a window a significant window to accomplish it like basically they should be going consistently up until like the pain management visit after that it's like take some time to schedule injections or surgeries or things like that so there's some like I guess there, but like initial appointment, there shouldn't be any gaps really. 00:42:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So is there a reason why it wouldn't make sense to have at least a monthly follow up with somebody or every couple of months at a particular stage help me figure out like, if you were to look at this and just make sure you're on top of it and not assuming that things are going a particular way, what could you do that's not really bugging the client but is being proactive and making sure that things are going along a schedule? 00:42:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Like a quick text? Yeah. Every 30 days or something? 00:42:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Do you think that that's reasonable to at least have your team attend every 30 days? Okay. So we're just going to put this down here, attend. Well, so let's say we don't hear back for every 30 days. So let's say, okay, it's in 30 days, we send a text message. If we don't hear back, then do we check a week later and just keep doing it every week until we do hear back, just to make sure that we're still connecting? 00:43:18 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:43:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, let's see the text. Um, in the case with no contact. Um, well, I'll say example, in treatment. Really, that's probably the only thing, because everything else you'd be talking to a doctor or insurance, or you need to be talking to them about distributions, right? So this would probably be the only time that there's just an okay period to not be talking for a while and not managing the time. 00:44:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Is that correct during treatment? Yeah, I mean, you want to make sure they're going and stuff, but like, there's a certain point where It's less required because like, let's say, they can appointment for like October 28 for an injection, right? Right. It's kind of like It's a month away. 00:44:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There's no point. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. What I'm saying is, is there any other status here that the case could be in where It's acceptable to not hear or not have any communication efforts for even more than a few days. 00:44:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Negotiations like I got a 30 days for the insurance to respond. So There's not really not going to be much update until I hear back type of thing. 00:44:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So that makes sense. Um, but if the insurance has responded, then you're in a new state. 00:45:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Anyway, right or you're still dealing with it. No, it's still negotiations, but I have to update the client on what the offer was things like that. 00:45:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I better. Yeah. Okay. Um, all right. So we were going back in here. Let's just go ahead and. don't want that. Look at a few more cases real quick. Last one September 13, just a few days ago. So, um, mailing insurance, companion matter, oh, um, like, incidences in the same, like, multiple people. Okay, like Yeah. Okay. Yesterday, Saturday, four months ago. 00:46:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) And this one, I texted her recently. 00:46:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I'm stations. 00:46:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Right. Go back. 00:46:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. And you would think that that would be more useful on the home page, just immediately there, but okay, so that's been touched. Good job. This is what we want to see though is that, that says July 24th, don't go to conversations. 18th year to go. Okay, well actually, let me ask you a question. 00:47:28 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) So he's just still in treatment. 00:47:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. I'm going to keep getting them until three months out, because it's all up, okay, three months out. I didn't pay attention to which one I was on, I'm just going to look down here. July 24th. Two months ago. So. Um, what should we look at to see, like, uh, still have back pain and decided to get that after all? Uh, that was three months ago, which I'm gonna call, yeah, I mean, that seems like that should be followed up with what do you think? 00:48:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, was there a note on the website at all? 00:48:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, details right here, July 24th was the last thing. 00:48:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, so this one has to be touched. 00:48:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So here's what I would recommend for you just to, again, so we're just trying to figure out what helps you get things done the quickest without being tedious. Now, the amount of volume that you have, maybe you spread it out across a couple of days, but this wouldn't take very long, especially if you did this every week and just literally went in, clicked on all of them real quick, because what would happen is if you started doing that and you started following up with your team, they should be doing this. They should be checking on their stuff and you go look at it and go, yeah, they're on it. And then you just start to do it as just kind of randomly going through the cases as a audit and just be like, hey, is there anything that has gone too long without being touched? And if so, who did it? Why are we unclear about what the expectations are? just think that we shouldn't, but is there a disagreement internally about whether we should or we shouldn't? is there not enough clarity about what requires a response? Is it that some people just feel like they're bothering clients? And, and, and does that need to be trained because like, who's bothered by getting the job done for them that we're supposed to do, getting it wrapped up posted up that type of thing. 00:50:11 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:50:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) be something that you'd be willing to do is just just go like once a week, just once a week. And you can split it across two days if it just is annoying, but honestly, that should go really quick. I think, I think you could be done with all your cases in an hour. Just click, get out. Because most of them, you're going to see, yep, they touched it. Yep, they touched it. Yep, they touched it. There should only be a few where you're like, that's a long period, or you know that you looked at that last week. And you know that they're not at a time period that, because you already looked at it, right, that we should be messaging out. It's going to be a few more weeks. So after the first couple of times, it shouldn't take you very long. Yeah. But the insight into the gaps should be really quick and really clear. Would you do that? 00:51:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, I mean, my file reviews are basically that. 00:51:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:51:06 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) So, once you've clicked our older cases, I should focus on those. But typically, on the new ones, I'll just check like the intro call was done. We've found insurance to take set liability. Basically, get the case, like the green light to start treating it. Middle ones are more, you know, where are they at? Are they going? going? Do they fall off? Are they missing? And then the really old ones is typically settled or we're just like waiting on health insurance, lean type of things. yeah, mean, I pretty much do what you just asked. But yeah, this case needs to be touched for sure. 00:51:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, what is your schedule for doing that and making sure you've covered that? 00:52:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) all the cases, like what's the frequency? I try to do it at least every other day. 00:52:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) All the cases? 00:52:10 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Not all of them, but like we'll go through a portion of my case list. The other week we've got like a bunch of new files. like, you know, I went ahead and went through all those, make sure like what first of all see what the case is. Is it like a big case, small case? What potential issues we might have with it? Where to send a client for treatment? 00:52:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So would you just be willing then, let's say this is a starter, top to bottom, I'm looking at the way that we just looked at it. then also, and because we're running out of time, I don't know there's enough for you to tell me all of this, but like I'd like to understand all the things that you look at when you do file review. Now, we did talk about, would you be willing to do file review with your team yesterday? You did. And how many files did you go through? 00:53:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) We just felt like we did like 40 minutes. I think we went through like 10 cases. 00:53:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so that's a long process. So my version of this audit is definitely not as thorough as what I think that you were doing. But there were two cases that probably should have been touched that we found in the first few. And like you said, they were older. So what I would like is just once just go through everything top to bottom. And then next week when we're all meeting, of give me some insight as to what you discovered and realize, okay, we should be doing it this way. And maybe it's by the age of the case. Maybe it's by a status or something like that, but. How can we just make sure that we're not going too long without touching the case and making contact with the client? And yeah, it's just about making sure because there are so many moving pieces, so many cases, so many different things to do, so many different reasons, it's not a fluid process, right? Because there's so much waiting on insurance, on doctors, on the patient, the client. So it could be really easy to have for things to fall through the gaps. So having a very specific process that makes sure that the only way to not have things fall through the cracks is top to bottom. could do that broken up as long as you're sorting the cases by date, right, by the day that they open, not because until they're closed. And so let's say you starting with the most recent cases up to like the most recent 50 cases, and then the next one, the next day, the next review, whatever, within that week, two weeks max, you're getting to the next 50. But then, so what I also think is two types of fire review. is just the quick glance, did it get touched, which you could go through all those 116 cases, probably in an hour. And you wouldn't have to go through all of them every week because they're, you know, they'd be really quick. So there's that version of it, and then there's the thorough, are there opportunities for us to like, do we need to do something different? But what I think will happen preemptively, is that as you go through in your skin, you'll go, you know what, we don't need to review that as a team, I saw enough of it, it's good. So then you can mark the cases that you probably should review as a team, have some questions about or somebody else you saw, there was a question that somebody on your team had, and then save those for the team power reviews because there's potentially something to discuss, whereas if everything looks good, you can just be like, you know what, nothing to discuss there, so you don't need to waste the team's time with basically managerial kind of oversight effort, which would be better with you for the most part anyway. So how do you think, how do you feel about that? 00:56:42 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, I think that's the best way to do it because naturally we all go through our cases just to see what's, you know, available to be settled or, you know, these cases are my responsibility at the end of the days, so I need to know, you know, where they're at. and make sure that they get maximized. no, I think you'd write, it's the best way just to go through each one. 00:57:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so let's give that a try. I would love by the time that we meet next Tuesday that you had a chance to just go through everything and look at that and just kind of note anything. One thing I would love to note is how many cases had not been touched in more than 30 days. Do you remember that? Yeah. Okay. And just anything else that might have stood out and let's do the longest. Like, so whatever you notice, like, so there's one that hasn't been touched for three months. If you see anything longer than that, like, I want to know what's the longest that they had reached out just to check and make sure. and then here's our next step, just kind of restating the expectations of how the case will proceed. Does that make sense? Just people are people, know, and especially if they're going through hard things, there's a huge difference for really it's just a little amount of effort. It could just be the text message, right? And you could even have fairly canned text messages that are but let me fix this before putting in the number and or I guess if you're using the automations, it's already there so just be careful. But just it's that feeling of we are aware of you and we're at and we're checking in on you. It's a human nature nurture. 00:59:50 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) no, I get it. I mean, we don't really think about it because, you know, we see the cases every day but it's a business perspective for you, but nearby. 01:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like something traumatic and bad happened to me and all of this sucks and somebody called to check on me and it made my day, you know? 01:00:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 01:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It could do a lot for us and it can also increase referrals possibly if we just really made somebody feel good. It's a little thing. It could have a big impact over time and a compounding effect too as we gained that reputation for just really kind of holding, it's not hand holding, it's 30 days, but compared to just waiting through things, you know, make them not feel like it's a number and a transaction, that type of thing. Okay. Well, we were able to have that whole conversation because you did all of this, so great job. 01:00:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I'm here to see Lorenz have stuff that I didn't know on there. 01:00:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, so we're all meeting next week and we will take a look at it and I think that that is going to be useful too. I'm really glad that you guys want to do that. the the working together thing because I think it's going to be insightful and even if it's just like a five percent difference um but if you give him five percent of your good stuff and he gives you five percent of his good stuff you know none you're both you're both just getting better and and then we're all getting better insight into the whole thing it's good you know that's not good you got to fix that i know that's what navies are for i can't take it out though because i have conversations every day or no no i can't because i just lift super heavy until i can't and then i can't walk for a few days but my strength increases i lose weight i still have more energy my like i did some studying and it's crazy like it's like kind of a new hack. I don't have to exhaust myself. So yes, I I could do better. My last lake press was 390 though, and it was smooth like butter. So I was pretty happy with that, okay? 01:02:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Okay. I'll be able to work out every day. You won't stay up late because you'll hate yourself afterwards. 01:02:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I know, but I'll be so tired all the time. I ain't trying to be like that. And I just no. Naps are cool. Did you know I'm gonna leave you with this? It's like 80 reduction in cardiovascular events for people, especially men who take naps three or more times a week of at least 20 minutes. Massive benefit. 01:02:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I don't know I'm a weekend for sure. 01:02:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, you gotta get, you gotta get one in the middle of the week, just a little 20 minute. Maybe not. You're still young, but you're not up there like grandma here. All right, it was great talking to you. 01:03:02 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) What time is it? 01:03:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) two. Yeah, oh, we're over. I will nag mark for the report again. He did this emoji. 01:03:11 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Good luck. Have a great day. I'll talk to you next week. Good to see you. You too. Bye-bye. Bye. patrick@sweetlaw.comPatrick
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You Thank you. Hi, how are you? 00:04:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) How are you? 00:04:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Sleepy. I'm not fully awake yet. didn't eat yet. daughter took my, well, older daughter took my younger daughters to seminary. So got to sleep in a little bit, but I was up till two working. So. No, it's just the way my body works better like that. Yeah, but also I have a missionary training at nine o'clock. So, are we going to have to check? Sure. think I do. I do. So, anyway, what were we talking about yesterday? 00:05:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We were talking about mama bear marketing, um, talking about the, um, the Google Doc we have on there in the community and how to build the offers and all that stuff. then your boxers, just listened to and yeah, so I did have a fun night last night. Thank you. And, um, and then this morning, I actually was at my mom's for bit and then, but you know, I feel a little off-kilter and then after this call after I picked my dog up because I didn't do my Bible journaling or anything this morning because I just got off and went straight to artwork and then helping my mom. Um, but uh, yeah, so in the chat chat stuff, yeah, that's cool too. I remember Ravi doing that when I used to work for him a couple years ago. So, and yeah, that was cool. I think me and Karina were going to launch a AI thing for e-com for Shopify stuff. I know we were building a little bit of about two, but we never really launched it per se, except everyone still goes to the free version. But I get what you mean, like what would Maria say? Like, that is, it is powerful. 00:06:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, Yeah. Um, I was trying to figure out if I could figure out who I'm bear marketing was. Cause I remember there's this lady that's been around a long time also. 00:06:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And her name is Barb Ling. Oh, Barb Ling. Yeah. 00:06:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She goes by mama bear now. 00:06:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, oh, I thought she used to be just barbelling marketing or something. 00:06:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. might be, but she on Facebook now, she's mama bear B. Oh. 00:06:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, I'm a barbelling authority marketing coach. Yeah, she bought some stuff for me in the back of the day. And then she also, it was in the worry form of doing good offers. Like she's just a decent person, you know? that offers. 00:07:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm on her page and she doesn't say mama bear on her website but she just shows coffee. That's why I remember her. She's really in the coffee. That's right. 00:07:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) yeah, she says on apology baby blue word 23 plus year veteran marketer coffee appreciator moose wrangler and more virtual coach. yeah, she doesn't have mama bear anywhere here but you're right. Maybe she just recently really branded. 00:07:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, no, this is um, if you go to facebook.com slash mama bear entrepreneur. That's her. 00:07:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah, I would. 00:07:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, and I think that that's That's her old profile that she switched over. 00:08:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, Fred's. Oh, she can't use that because that's a personal page, not a business page. 00:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. And I can't switch mine to a professional page, not, not business, but professional. It's not an option for me, which is weird. 00:08:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Anyway, yeah. Yeah, I'm just shocked to see that it's not a page page. Did they take that functionality away? Because it used to be pretty easy that you could switch it over to a professional page. 00:08:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I don't know when I have more than 500 followers and half for a long time. 00:08:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So I don't know why I wouldn't be able to. But I mean, it's been years since I've had a client do that. But yeah, I'm going to try to get maybe there was a glitch. I always think something's not working that should work on Facebook. Then it's a glitch and go back next day and try. 00:08:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, any of it, I've been looking at it for months because. they have analytics now. 00:09:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And it's not a business page, it's a newer thing. It's not, it's gone. 00:09:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Anyway, um, so I want to be paying attention to the time with my brain. I did want to share with you though, one thing that Dan sent me, I'll just put it in the notes. Um, it's okay, I bought it, and I would share it with you if you wanted it, but um, hold on a second, gonna find chat here. Really inexpensive, and I think the only thing I'd probably use it for would be maybe some quick um, graphic type creation. I haven't gone through everything yet. their sales page, showed that they have some automations for graphics, but a lot of variety. And they do have AI. I'm playing with it to see. I don't like to finish products. don't think it's quality enough to be representative me, but I do think this type of stuff is sometimes good for repurposing old things. And one of the tests that I wanted to run was kind of a side-by-side faceless type of campaign to see what can be done because there's a lot of faceless marketing. People don't care about knowing, liking, and trusting if it's not a huge investment. They care about, are you teaching me something useful? And I got, I don't know if I still have it, businessprofessor.ai, where I would basically repurpose the same content and just change the voice a little bit to not necessarily be about the mom's side and the personal details as much, but still the same. The value of the content. tactics, principles, things like that, because the duplication shouldn't be that difficult if I get low cost, you know, assistant. And then if I'm duplicating it, but under a different brand sufficiently, it shouldn't be anything that's penalized and it would be like diversifying, basically. But it's an experiment I want to run because the audiences are so much bigger than they were, even just a few years ago, even pre-COVID. And it keeps growing this world of, you know, people wanting to side hustle, things like that. was thinking about, you know, even when I was a kid, my mom did, Mary Kay, Tupperware, Avon, what else did she do? But there was, women were selling things. And then there was, you know, the candles and the melaleuca and the amway and all that type of stuff. So, but now they've got the internet. I just think that it's, and the statistics are there, but there's just so many people to get to who aren't internet marketers per se, who are maybe they sell at the farmers market on the weekend. they could be taught about profit margins and simple things like that. So anyway, kind of thinking about how to expand stuff. Instead of, I always feel like I get trapped in the high ticket world and high value and high level. I, there's only, like I said, there's only so much of that you can do anyway, because high level clients require high level performance and investment. And so, you know, there's only a few of that. Everything else needs to be leveraged. And I just realized, like, there's a lot of people who know almost nothing and just to be able to teach them. So, anyway, those thoughts. But, and then, okay, so we were talking about potentially starting something with both of us as a kind of like a baseline foundation and being able to. And I mean, even at the same time, parallel, while we're not working together, kind of duplicate some of that work. Like, we could create a school group or a high level community that's similar and just start piping people in and figuring out a very low level schedule like where once a week we show up and answer questions. And, but because high level has rocking, like, let's say you make a reference from your existing group that you're building into this group, that link would be a tracking link. So those people are tracked from day one. So if those people buy anything, no matter what they buy, you get the higher level commission. And because like I have Facebook followers, that would just come in and do things. And we can decide if we want to create it as a free group or, you know, maybe it's $20 a month and it's low cost. And we're going to show up and talk to each other anyway. But how scalable is that? How many people would want to come in? I'm thinking volume of people who have trusted enough to give a credit card for $20 and to make a commitment for $20 a month. I think that could add up pretty quickly. But then, as we're talking to them every week, figure out, okay, what are you guys interested, what are you responding to? Where does the conversation not where does it consistently go? 00:15:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Let's offer that. 00:15:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let's make a training. Okay, this training is going to be $200 and this is what we're going to do. And we don't even have to like we can go run ads separately to bring people into that training. But if we have a group full of people who have already paid $20 a month and half of them have said, I really need to know this. And you and I know it doesn't matter what they want to know, we're going to be able to teach it quickly, live probably. And then provide some really good resources which we can take to VAs. I've got a ton of them of different sorts, video graphics, PDFs, all the works where we can take the live content that we made and then go make some pretty visual supports for them. And then that becomes an evergreen product that already exists in the members area. like, hey, you have this problem. Here's all our testimonials, these people. we give this to them and and you can have it now and it does not have to be a live training and if then you know if something goes really well we can say we'll do the live training again in a few months whatever if people want live more because they can do Q&A then we charge more that's the thing but there's so many different topics we could just do that on repeat but then so the Maria Tina version is always going to be a little different than just Maria riffing all by herself and just Tina riffing all by herself but especially if we really kind of like if it's a marketing question I'm glad Maria go at it and I'll have a little bit pieces and if it's a business management operations kind of stuff then I'll go at it and you contribute when you have a little something to say you might have a lot to say but if we agree that we're going to kind of let the other one shine in a particular area but give the other space and go So, yeah, I actually have really something good to contribute I want to share so that we get a well-rounded thing, know, so we're not competing, but we are kind of compartmentalizing so that we can establish separate brands under one roof for our personal benefits while still serving the community really well. I think that that could work and just flow, especially because I'm not going to get offended that if you've got some great ideas, I'm going like, that's awesome, and I can have eyes. 00:17:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think that's, there's something there, yeah, I can't get my full hand around it of all the tracking, know, because I also don't want to fall down from it, you know. 00:17:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It won't be hard, and we could ask Dan for it, but it won't be hard. It's really, all it is, is anybody that comes into us has to to be tracked once because the source tracking so they're either coming in from an ad that we did which we would be tracking where they're coming in from one of our personal links and we just need to make sure if we want credit for it right that each of those links are trackable so if you're you would just have one group or you could have multiple links and I would show you how to do it so that you know it and I could even set them up for you if you don't even want to touch it and just be like Maria this is it and we'll go do a test test like source right and make sure that they're tagged as came from Maria we'll just put Maria something like that right and then show you so then if that person makes a purchase we'll have to figure out how to how to do their reporting and the commission structure but for sure Dan would help with that and if he didn't do it for free I'd hire somebody to do it but high level does that really easily okay yeah that's one of the great benefits of it And if the community is in high level and the sales are in high level, it's all there. Yeah. So, yeah, it would actually be really not quite as simple as doing it without the tracking, but the tracking is not going to be difficult. 00:19:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. Well, that's cool. That's cool. So, and just on another note, when you brought up Designer, I shared screen real quick. 00:19:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I've been using it since 2016. 00:19:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah. 00:19:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let me share screen right now. 00:19:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, I don't, haven't used AI, AI, AI part. See that 2016, I created the e-commerce email promotions, like it's a product I used to sell, don't know, for like seven bucks, low ticket offer. that's really big. something's worth about it. Anyway, but yeah. and actually just the recent YouTube video that did really well, I made the product here, the 100 digital offers. So I made it obviously in chat should be T first and some of my own input. And then I used the template and just like put in my own graphic here of the screenshot. And then it's just super, super simple. 00:20:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's not as pretty as camera. 00:20:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) but it did the job and I needed done like in about 10 minutes before I put it in the community. See, I bought, I haven't pinpointed it yet. Where is marketing master account? need to re send it to my school community. But anyway, so yeah, that's cool. 00:20:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I've done that. I want to share something with you too so you can see I need to feed it more data to this library. 00:20:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) But what does Dan think? what we should be offering and all that stuff? he have any ideas input? Because sometimes I'm going to be honest, sometimes I get too confused. you know, when I start thinking about all the things, and maybe just because I'm not centered, because I haven't done my bible stuff here. 00:21:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Meditations are journaling this morning. I didn't ask him, but we could if you want to do, I think he is a massive Maria fan and Tina fan. So ask, ask, um, pretend you're a person that has a business question, fairly simple, um, about business operations or principles or strategies or even problem solving. Let's see how this AI does. 00:21:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, um, how do I get traffic from YouTube marketing? 00:21:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I haven't, it will be my kind of content, like, um, just, just not marketing specific, like, um, what should I pay my stuff? hiring people, how should I choose what to work on? um, yeah, pretty much anything that's not marketing strategy specific. 00:22:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) How could I get more productive in my business, family? 00:22:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I told you not to say, ah, would never say that. 00:22:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Look at that. It affects hourly rate now for the game changer. yeah. 00:23:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Now, go make that magic. 00:23:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) You got this. 00:23:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I mean, if for just being able to ask a question that that would give if somebody had never experienced that. Yeah, that we get them started. Anyway, so I haven't vetted all of my content yet, because you can only give it 10 files. So what I have to do, and I'm going to hire a VA to do this, is combine multiple transcripts into a single file, because it's not really, I don't know what the limit to the eyes of the files is, but I haven't anywhere near approached that. Okay, so just putting it into single files. And then I've also included the transcripts of testimonials from clients. Really long ones on YouTube that give details as to like what I can do for them. So anyway, yeah, just this. So I want to use this to when it's trained properly create short pieces of content for me based off of things I've already created and done. So if I want to pick a topic in any, I don't necessarily want to just use it as it comes out. For sure, I would edit some of these things all the time the struggle. No, that's no. Tell me your AI without telling me your AI that. But and take something, put some bones on it and go like, Oh, yeah, okay, well, tweet this, tweet this, even ask it a question because it's asking it from my library of vast library of information once I get all my calls in there and then be able to repurpose it according to okay well this is a Twitter post I wanted to and I know you can do threads on Twitter but if I wanted to make it shorter and make it like one line each so I can break it up into Instagram quotes and then go send it to a VA who plugs it into some images from you know really quickly there's like four and five dollar an hour VA is still that are good at Canva and I don't know if they're as fast as maybe eight or ten dollar VA's so that's an experiment I'm going to be playing with and I usually hire a couple people and just kind of try them against each other see what ends up being most profitable just because people are cheaper for our doesn't mean that they're cheaper for our. got it, got it. Yeah. So anyway, but yeah, um, what, what would help you get some clarity on the opportunity of what it would look like to do work together. Um, so that's, well, so that it's clear and then you can decide, do you want to put any mental energy into it or not. 00:26:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Um, I think, I think just like, so we got the free community, right? 00:26:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It can be free. It can be paid. It can be paid from, from the beginning, just low cost, like really low cost, but so that we know that we've got people who want to be there enough with their money, who have enough trust to pass over a credit card. 00:26:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay, so it's almost like, uh, I kind of do this when I. Great offers for people who share screen. know you got to go like a little minutes. Share screen. It'd be sort of is one that I've done with us for I'm possible. So basically like customer journey map like like like these are different. So like you know step one was micro offer magic you know then or about social group and five so step one could be like a community five bucks month. Maybe we make it like one buck a month or five bucks a month or whatever ten bucks a month and then what in their customer journey what is it like what step to what's that offer there and like what are we thinking right like what so we can kind of yeah so so like and if I go I don't know who else I've done a few of these four. or community. 00:28:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I have a quick idea for that the first variation. think the first version is you come into the community and we both have free pieces of content that they can consume so that they can get familiar with us and just kind of have a place and we encourage just talking. So it's basically another version of an email list, kind of. We can communicate with them. But it's in a place where so high level has an app, I think. And it's like lead something, whatever. But it's mobile and they have magic links so that people can open some things right from their email and go straight to the paid member area. And I'm OK with using school and paying for that too, if they need me. for sure, we'd want to charge like $5 a month or something. The first level is, we're going to put in lots of our content, pre-existing content, and you have access to it, and then the second level could be also not very much, and it could be either, like for me, could be they get the profit time, energy maximizer, and maybe one of your products, that is a paid product, but low cost. In addition, we'll have weekly meetings and you can show up to it, and so we maybe put the recordings in the free group, but they don't get to ask questions unless they're in the paid group, or in the like the five dollar month group, they get recordings, and let's say $20 or $40 a month group, you can come in and ask questions and we will answer your questions. So, the lower level group is you get our content, not our time. The next level up is you get our content and our time. And the next level up could be something much more high level once we figure out and we start talking to people. 00:30:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Good. 00:30:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) else are you going to go get 20 year veterans in business, women, know, that have been online veterans. It's not very, it's not easy to find. 00:30:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) No, I know I'm going to have an analyze them and I probably should join their community. 00:30:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) If I go to school discovery. 00:30:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) There's one woman that. I imagine in this grandma is making a lot and has all these people in that community. It's really right at the top of your digital growth community. It's number one for engagement and yeah, she's got. You know, you you you know, to build a daily pay customer base digitally. 00:31:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 39,000 members and what's the cost? 00:31:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) This one might be her free group, let's see, proven six-figure. 00:31:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) says paid. 00:31:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Where? Right there. yeah, but here, because there's joint group, okay. So, yeah, what email did you use to purchase? Okay, so she's then selling it via sales page, okay. Only how people to pay the joint here, live weekly mentoring support, giving monthly networking events, zero of six-figure online is six months. That's her promise. She looks really good, actually. That's fine, I don't know her name is. Payment methods. Are you saying that? 00:31:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) what's right there. 00:31:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Are you early, 423? And she's new system IO, isn't it, she's system Ha ha. That's her name. And she has any love us? 00:32:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How many do you have math real quick? 39, what was the note was 47? Yeah, so 39,000 times 47. That's 829,000 a month. 00:32:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Holy crap. 00:32:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And it's more than that because it's almost 40,000. 00:32:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So road map to attract daily pay customers digitally, build an impactful email list, create a well-known brand and proven six figures in six months formula. 00:32:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So my thing about wanting to do this stuff together is that both you and I have gone to the point where, and because we can still, like I said, have our separate stuff and feed it so that you're not risking building everything around me. And vice versa, not that I'm even worried about it, but that's just this smart thing to do because anything can happen, right? But the roadblocks that both of us will have, we'll get to them so much faster. We'll doing something together. And I mean, I'm all about leverage. To me, it would be so leverage because we have different skill sets, but we have very similar skill sets too. And one of them is so few people just show up and work all the time. And I don't mean all the time. don't actually work all the time, but I show up every day. I move the needle every day. lot of people, most people honestly, really don't do that. I've worked with tons of people. There's a lot of inconsistency, even with high-level performers, because they burn themselves out. so it cycles a burnout. I don't get burnt out. I don't let burnout happen to me. Because I nap. A lot. I can nap three times a day. I will nap three times day if that's what it takes. You feel good. I take time off. I take little trips like so and I don't work long hours, but yeah, I do show up consistently. I pay for help. I pay for good help. I train good. Most people pay for help. And then they don't train well. And so it's not useful. I'm not getting any help. I dig in and I get to thorough training quickly. Screen sharing, video sharing, then so we're doing it together. I'm showing you and then you tell, you show me that you can do it. And then you go be released to do the work. And we have constant communication and feedback. So like, some people, most people abdicate. 00:34:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I delegate. Yeah. 00:34:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) and they think that they're delegating, but they're abdicating anyway. And now your brain is always considering about marketing and offers. I hate starting there. also, you, yeah, I mean, you just love the part that I like. 00:35:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) to go about a lot. 00:35:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And I think where you have friction is clarity and should it be this or this and also anchoring because if you're trying something every month and that's your habit that I know that it's just your tendency to kind of bounce around. So what you would need support with is how does your spirit get the freedom to explore? Because obviously that's important to you. Without that sabotaging what you're already doing by distracting you too much. You get to play and get that outlet but you've got somebody helping you go okay. Now that you've played you have to make a decision. Do you keep playing there or can you bring something back to here because this is what you chose first or are you switching and if you're switching be real clear about why you're switching and make sure that it's aligning with your values because Sometimes we need permission to switch, and we give ourselves permission, right? Sometimes that's the thing to do too, but that logical conversation, I can have in my sleep. Yeah. You get really clear and really confident and peaceful, because that's the part that slows things down is trying to figure it out, you know, do what I want to do and don't I want to do it. And the usually it's a why, but sometimes that why is not very clear. And so the probing questions that have you get to that why, that's what I'm really gonna add. 00:36:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. Okay. I love based on what we just saw. I think we just have one community that's a little ticket, maybe start at $5 and bring it up to $47 and be like that girl. Like I think we just saw maybe a path. 00:36:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:36:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Sorry. Between the two of us like there's like, yeah, like people get so much value out of it. 00:36:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's what I was thinking something about too is just starting. really level and bringing it up and be like, okay, the price is increasing, the price is increasing until we get to kind of a place where the conversions drop and we keep increasing it. That way we can get numbers in because there's nothing like an empty group trying to talk to an empty group. And then we learn as we grow, but I think that that's the rocket fuel is getting the people to come in and tell us how we can serve them that were already attracted to us for whatever reason at a low level cost. And then we serve them really well and we can let them be grandfathered in or say, you get this price for this next year, but for this year, you know, but next year we're raising prices because in place and whatever, nobody, yeah, groceries don't get it locked in, rent rarely doesn't like occasionally, but most things in class. Yeah. got it. So I think the next steps would be to to kind of create like a very simple map like that, right? what the offer is and what the content would be. So like, I think if I have that profit time, energy maximizer to serve to the community, I feel like you think number one, I feel like I've brought a valuable contribution that earns whatever my low level portion of it is, right? And I'll keep bringing it. You bring something of yours. And but that's impactful that you know that they're going to go. Something is going to be they'll have an aha moment or something tactical that they can implement right away, but not your best stuff, right? And then we just put together an offer put together some graphics and images and start piping people in for $5 the first time for like, and Honestly, we'll see that the issue with school is that there's a few issues. First of all, people can very easily see how much you're making and how much money you have because of how many people are in your group and what your paid price is. Yeah, that's just one thing. Competitors, whatever. There's that. School does pipe people in, but you can only charge one price a month per group. So if you raise the price, you can't let one group. If you charge it through school, so what she did was she charged off-site and let them in for free or however it worked out, but because school only lets you charge one price per person. So if you say it's $5 for you guys, but it's $35 for you guys, you can't do that. 00:39:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) School, I'll let you do that. 00:39:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So anyway... We would just have to figure out the tactical approach around that and she does it, which is charging the money off of school and then letting them into it. 00:40:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, yeah, stuff to think about, yeah, all right, we'll have fun. Okay, you're going to your, your study? 00:40:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, I'm late, it's a missionary training, but they record it so I can still get it. maria@mariagudelis.comTina MarieMaria & Tina🪄
00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hello, how are you? 00:00:12 - Dan Ryan (3) Cleaners day and up on the poetry of my various furry friends. 00:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I like it. 00:00:21 - Dan Ryan (3) Doing calls, doing meetings, look out. 00:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's good, it's good. I got a full night's sleep and groceries just got delivered. My older daughter took my younger daughter to seminary and she's making dinner tonight. And there's a flipping spider on my ceiling. Hopefully I must go with this. A comment? I don't want to get it. I don't like spiders. But I am the only spider killer. I guess you get to live for a while. I don't feel like dealing with it. 00:00:59 - Dan Ryan (3) I don't want to live. 00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's, it's no spiders. Anyway, what, uh, was it a work call you had just now? 00:01:12 - Dan Ryan (3) Two, then I, uh, talked to developers at, uh, SOD at nine, and then I just had a meeting with Circle, because I was like, you know what, I'm going to look at these other community platforms, and I'm officially sold on Circle, Tina. It is. 00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Really? Yeah. Taylor, well, to agree with you. 00:01:35 - Dan Ryan (3) Uh, okay. Uh, probably not for the reasons. I'm sure Taylor really didn't evaluate it and just copy Brandon Burshaw or something. Uh, I'm like talking to the guy like, okay, what if I want to send a, you know, I didn't, I was like, I have a CRM and what if I want to send people over from my CRM? So they're going to opt in. through this lead thing, and that's where I'm going to send them emails, and that's where I'm going to make offers and pitch ship and, right, because they don't really have massive email or whatever. mean, yeah, I don't think they even have it. And I go, and then I want to get them over and I want to tag them with the three things that I'm collecting in the form. He's like, yep, API, don't use apps. I go, okay, great, that could be that. And then I was like, all right, let's say I want to have a free level, and then I want to have different paid tiers. So let's have paid tier one is like a group coaching thing, or whatever, or, or it's one on one coaching, or let's say I want to do a cohort. So there's like a six week cohort. He's like, let me show you, opens up all these sites. He's like, you can do everything you just said. was like, God damn, really? It's like, okay, how do I generate the payment? it's like the payments here. You can make it. a month to month. So you can make it a full page, you can make it a month to month. You've got a link at the end. Okay, so I have that link. So if I'm on a sales call, for example, I can downsell to the page, that payment plan is ID up, and you just send in this link, I know it's in the link through the fee around, I go, okay, what if I want to, what if I want to take, I got this is further down the I go, if I want to take activity from, from circle and update my record in my CRM. So using mom as an example, I met with him and I talked about Ninja and mom. Not so much because I thought I would use it for Ninja, but he literally, the reason I said Brendan Bouchard is because he showed me Brendan's thing. So what they're releasing right now is a headless API, that you can take circle components and put it inside. Buddy balls, basically. So when he opened up Brendan's side, And was like, that's body boss. And he's like, it is? And he's yep. But he's like, well, that's what Brent. And he's like, I don't know who he's doing it for him. But he's like, they're doing it. So see, they had circles just iframed inside body boss, which looked good, as a matter of fact. And but now you can take components, like the feed component, and then have that in there. And your users are in body boss, but you're using circle. And I was like, he's like, so you don't have to pay millions of dollars to develop these widgets, because you can use ours. I'm like, oh, that's dope. I didn't know you could do that. He's like, it's not out. It's coming out like two weeks. He's like, you're just showing me because it sounds like you would get it. I definitely get it. So then Brendan's got someone doing it for him. 00:04:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like, I'm pretty sure I can find out who did that. 00:04:50 - Dan Ryan (3) And then go talk to them. So yeah, I'm like, man, this is high levels. They're never going to catch up. of this. Schools never going to catch up to this. Like, these guys are way, way further ahead. 00:05:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, but I went and just got that snapshot yesterday. 00:05:09 - Dan Ryan (3) That's okay, because I do still think like you could do the sales calls. 00:05:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Wait, you got what's natural? Community one that you showed me. 00:05:18 - Dan Ryan (3) I think that can work. I do think that can work still, but for mom, because mom to me is going to be extremely complicated. So it's going to have, it's going to have all the things that I just said. You want a free tier, then you want a paid tier, then you want a government tier, then you want a dedicated error for fan flow users, then you want a dedicated area for people that are in. But we're, I don't know if this is going to be the name, but we have this continuous release strategy. So it'd be like, hey, no, you're going to pay to be in the continuous release strategy cohort. One, which starts in January, two starts in February 3 starts in March, and in that group, you are releasing a song every 8 to 12 weeks with whoever's in that 20-person cohort, whatever. So those would all need to be separate paid tiers and separate private groups. And I'm like, yeah, so at that level, I love them, right? I don't know. have no idea. 00:06:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think you leave it out with the communities, because if you can't do that, then that would be a deal breaker for me too, because I want multiple tiers. And one thing that Circle can do that I don't know if you came across it, but it gives you stats of who's logged in and what information they've consumed. 00:06:48 - Dan Ryan (3) Yeah, you have to actually build some of that, he showed me that. Yeah. Interesting. The other thing that they have that is perfect for mom is spotify interest. I was like, oh, that's dope, and then they do mp3s, which we need, which high level doesn't support. So I was like, okay, but it's also like, you could do this headless thing and put it inside of high level. I was like, oh, that would be interesting. So you can still use high level and then just have circle inside of high level and he showed me another version of that. And it was just like the E card and he was saying, yeah, if you owe off, he kind of lost me. It was not super off on oh off, but he's like, imagine you just owe off your high level log in that you give them. It's the exact same log in for circles and they log in high level, they log in circle, they just don't know. It's like, yeah, that would be great. So yeah, but I'm not totally sold, but I was like, oh. of this headless API is super interesting. 00:08:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What is a headless API? 00:08:08 - Dan Ryan (3) I mean, it's like you're not you're not using the wrapper, right? So you're not using the container of it of circle. So you're using the compound, you're getting access to the components. You can do with WordPress too. So it's like, it's super lightweight. There's not a lot of other code. It's just a thing. It's fairly new. I hadn't really ever heard. I'd heard of it for WordPress. I had not heard of it for like one of these standalone softwares that was surprisingly said that I was like, oh, okay. I did not see that coming. 00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Interesting. Maybe. Oh, 00:09:00 - Dan Ryan (3) But I'm looking at it more for, because we've been talking to these dudes grooved for the bands. So then I was like, I don't like those guys. And there's no way they're going to catch up to any of these people's school. You know, whether it's school or circle or it might be networks. But these guys are starting out and they're not even called Pepsi Sprite. They're nothing. They're like Fanta. They're never going to. But they're trying to target just musicians. that's sort of the value problem. But tech wise, they're texting. 00:09:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Who's texting? 00:09:45 - Dan Ryan (3) They're called groups. 00:09:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I was like, wait, what is the group? 00:09:53 - Dan Ryan (3) Okay, never run. Yeah, but it's the, it's those, I mean, props. It's those TikTok influencers. They're like, they got so much reach on TikTok. now they're like, oh, we do communities for all audiences. And they've gotten some of the biggest TikTokers to be on the platform. And they're, they're using that to attract other people. But the problem is the software itself stinks because it's a bunch of TikTokers developing software. Like, yeah, it's not good. It's not going to go well long term. 00:10:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think the, um, man, it's always so complex. There's so many things that have to be measured. So like the speed of implementation. So school is super fast to implement. That's really, to me, the only draw about it. There's a lot of drawbacks, including analytics, you have to pay for every community, um, they don't integrate, the communities don't integrate with each other really well, where you could do that with like circle. I think Circle is pretty quick to integrate, but also has a lot of complex features that you could do and it doesn't have a native app, but it does have an app. So that's good. You don't know if it has a magic link, which I think is really good for people that don't want to use the app and just want to be able to go straight to their content without having to log in and remember a password because a lot of people don't use password managers and they don't have an efficient login process. Yeah. But what I'm looking at in this high level community is it is convoluted. That was my issue with high level to begin with is that it's convoluted. It's there's. It's not pointing click. You know what I mean? It's not intuitive. And then same with Buddy Boss was the same thing. 00:11:51 - Dan Ryan (3) So yeah, Buddy Boss is not intuitive at all. 00:11:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) no, you've got to have somebody who knows exactly what they're doing. And that is. 00:12:00 - Dan Ryan (3) Not super easy to come by thing Yeah, what you need is like well, I mean, I think you got right the snapshot for high level is gonna have Hey do this or it's gonna build a bunching for you You would need something like that force you would need something like that for circle too But there's no snapshots right it's gonna be Build and you'd need someone that like he took me in a community that was clearly a coach and then doing individual coaching so like You would have like a damn thing so when I log into circle as like Let's say I'm like so I'm your high ticket level right so it's like you log in I'm high ticket I get access to everything like the courses or all the logs for me, but then I also have a dedicated damn coaching in the area they call it a coaching, but it's not literally the coaching area. And then inside that you could have Dan, Mark, blah, blah, blah, but Mark can't see Dan and Dan can't see Mark. So all I see under coaching is Dan. And then it's a dedicated stream of Dan and Tina. I was like that's interesting not be group. 00:13:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He goes, yeah. 00:13:25 - Dan Ryan (3) Okay, I didn't see I didn't see that coming. I can say in the video, I asked him to send me the recording. 00:13:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's all it's interesting. So what are your priorities for the membership for mom? 00:13:45 - Dan Ryan (3) So I've already proven I can generate a lead for under two dollars. And then they I think like 80% of them opted to join the Facebook group. But now I'm like, okay, I can just force and I can ask them if they want to join the community, if they assent, yes, and I can automatically go create the record in wherever I can do it in high level, I can do it in a circle. So then I go automatically create that record. So I'm not just putting in everyone, I'm putting in all the people that say yes, and then I'm tagging them as whatever, yes. And then the people that say no, I'm tagging them as no to invite them later. And then you would deliver potentially deliver the thing through the group and through email. So they're opting in, think I did two of the things I did, royalty release checklist and I did, no, I'm sorry, did a royalties checklist and then a release checklist. So they could get the thing in the group, or they could get the thing in the email either way. then ultimately they're for each, now we're going to Fletcher, if each thing is actually tied to a course, then you could sell them the course and deliver the course inside wherever, wherever that can be used. Then you have a free community that's just a bunch of people that are in the independent music space. And then I'm tagging them based on the first things that they tell me and then you'd enrich that, we let them enrich that through their profile, right? So the only thing I really ask them on the way in is what are you? And they're either a producer, engineer, an artist, a band, where those options are. So you would immediately be able to identify someone who's a band, come on up on that, possibly genre, and then you'd give them the ability to, hey, this is my Spotify thing. Because part of me has been mutilating, I forget who did this back in the day. I think it might have been Justin or somebody else. But... it was like in the community, they would go juice people's Facebook posts, right? just put up this ad, can you guys go like it? And then a bunch of people would just go like the ad and back at that time, that was an indicator to push the ad further for Facebook. So it was like the community was participating in juicing other things within the community. So my version of it is like, you earn credits. So you can, if you do it, you get a credit. And then you can then, once you have that credit, that credit can be spent when it's time to promote your song. It's like, okay, you have 10 credits, so you can now get 10 clicks. Something like that. So when someone released this song, it's Spotify. It's like, hey, my song's out, Ghost Treatment. That's the signal to Spotify. People are interacting, it's Ghost Treatment, whatever else, whatever the things are. So, or you don't do that. It's just that. community is supporting, right? I came and released this out, and one go go support it. 00:17:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, um, I don't know. They're so whatever. So, the circle has like gamification features in there. I think you're what you were talking about that they do actually. 00:17:28 - Dan Ryan (3) But they have, they have a bad game and stuff, but it's not game. It's not game. It's your, you decide. So you can build an automation in the background that hands out badges and stuff. It's not, it's not like built in. It's your user. So you could be like, completed the cohort completed the course that he showed me that those are these options. Automations that you build. There's nothing made of. That's like, oh yeah, we automatically have this game of occasion component. Hmm. Yeah. 00:18:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, but and I don't know all the different ways that you could do it, but the idea that you have where the community supports each other with those credits for like listening to songs, downloading songs, whatever. I don't know. But I don't know that I heard the answer for like, like, if you were going to rank, first of all, if you were going to list the features that you want and then rank them, but I guess it doesn't matter if you found a solution that does everything that you want, but in the search for things, if you hadn't found everything, I would be curious to know what were the things that you had been looking for. 00:18:56 - Dan Ryan (3) So, was it my list? 00:18:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) it was Marx. 00:19:00 - Dan Ryan (3) So, Mark was always shooting down this or the other so like the last thing he sent was oh MP3 and then not sport it was like do beyond having a dream and like yeah, we do That's kind of a deal breaker for a music community because everyone's dealing in mp3 or mp4 so there's no music no music in bed and and then Circle also just happen on Spotify. was like oh, that's even better But not or not because when you're when you're in the pre-production phase Imagine you're in a group that's producing it while I'm working on a producing a song to be released You can only have mp3s of that while you're saying okay. Here's the first mix. It's gonna be an mp3 It's not it's not publicly available. You could put it on SoundCloud, but you probably don't want to It did have a SoundCloud integration too, which I was like god damn really but So yeah, Mark, it was that and it was he doesn't like when you put a video in, he wanted like a full full video post, I love Facebook and school doesn't do that, high level doesn't do that. So that was more of like just a UI sort of thing. School doesn't do it and high level is copying school, so therefore they don't do it. Circle doesn't. Mighty networks did it. Then as far as like, then there was just having the different, the pride of any sort of paywall, right, so I don't know school has a paywall. So having the free thing and then a paywall. 00:20:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So yeah, I think I like this. It's one or the other. You can either have a free group or a paid group, but you cannot have two tiers. 00:21:00 - Dan Ryan (3) Oh, see, school, you can have like nine, you can have unlimited tears. You mean circle? Um, circle, yeah. Um, and then the main thing he doesn't like about high level is it's built around courses, as opposed to being courses is part of it. So it's not really community, it's courses plus community, and he wants community first, there might never be courses, right? So what if, especially if you're dealing with just a band, a band is never going to have a course ever. Right. So he's like, we tried to, he's actually building community and more on that, um, trying to see how it goes. But that was the main sticking point is that it's like, uh, he's like, no, that doesn't fit for a band. What is a band teaching someone? 00:21:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's like, no, you're right. 00:21:57 - Dan Ryan (3) But I was like, we could use this for mom. He could put our core like it totally fits for forces first teaching first community second, but the this scenario is completely flip-flop. It's community first forces second. like, okay, then it makes sense. I mean, I guess that's probably the best way to look at it is that. Yeah, it's it's it's need community forward, not forces forward. So I like I went through this dude. 00:22:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I took him through like ninja explain what ninja was.-hmm. 00:22:37 - Dan Ryan (3) it was like the ninja falls apart with our MCQ product. He's like, yeah, no. like, you're you'd never be like, he's like, I'm not saying you can't you have developers probably could. But he's like, then that's when he showed me Brandon Bouchard's thing and I said, was like, that's buddy boss. I was like, oh, okay, that's kind of interesting. So we could head this. BPS circle into because I think buddy bosses community stuff stinks It's like oh This could be better And then we can do the stuff like you know, we log them into our MCQ software from within buddy boss They don't know that they left. 00:23:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He's like, oh, never gonna be able to do that Yeah, For me and and and also why which I know you think is proactive avoidance, but for me, it's really it's it's tactical learning Because it's hard for me to comprehend the user experience without having the user experience and Trying to create a list of what are the features that matter most like I can think of some things for me The course is the most important thing but community is really important as well because Because if I can leverage the conversation of other people in the community to kind of create almost like a gravitational pull towards the content, because there's also other people there. but but then you don't even know until you've done it does that work or not, you know, yeah, and so it's all theoretical. And it's just, it's just thoughts upon thoughts upon thoughts until you do it and experience it. And that's the biggest thing is that I, um, whatever, I think if the list of the main things are there, then whatever else trade offs that you make, like, we know nothing's going to be perfect. But as long as the main features that you need are there and they're solid, then, you know, you don't have to move. But if you do move. I don't know, it's a whole nother thing. It's so hard just trying to build on something. 00:25:07 - Dan Ryan (3) And also for you, you're like going top down. You might never get down, right? if you're currently at high ticket. 00:25:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Explain what you mean down. 00:25:17 - Dan Ryan (3) Right, so the opposite would be free low ticket, mid ticket, high ticket, right? And you're at high ticket. So community is really more for the free, right? 00:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's where the community still is going Agreed. 00:25:31 - Dan Ryan (3) So if you had me and Mark and someone's in Quasimodo or whatever that guy's name is, like, if they were all... 00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, wait, wait, who's Quasimodo? I don't know, but the doctor. Oh, Boogie. Boogie. 00:25:44 - Dan Ryan (3) So if like me and Mark, right? If you're trying clients, we're in a community. 00:25:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We're not going to go in the community. 00:25:53 - Dan Ryan (3) No. No, I might go in there, I might go in there because there's something there for me, right? Right. You're like, hey, log in. I need you to log in and watch this video. Like we're going to talk about this next week. Yeah, I'm going to be in there for that. And so there, but there might be some discussion. I could see Mark, you know, Mark loves to talk, right? And me too, right? I might comment back to someone, right, in that context. we're not going to get in this back and forth discussion. 00:26:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, I wouldn't even have my high level clients would never be there. Because first of all, I'm not giving somebody access to all my people, right? And be like, hey, guess what? These are all the people for you to try to coach or something like that. I'm not really afraid of it. It's just kind of the thing that I have embedded in my mind because of the texture. But also, it's super high touch. Like why would I downgrade our interaction? 00:26:45 - Dan Ryan (3) Well, I'm not saying it's to downgrade. 00:26:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So my point was that you have those people. 00:26:50 - Dan Ryan (3) And yeah, you could be like, hey, the stuff's here. And I would go do this thing, right? And then when you go down to the next level, and what is the next level? The next level is like course buyers. Even them, even them, whoever they are, it's not going to be super cheap, but it's still going to be whatever. And a lot of what your stuff teaches them is antithetical to wasting time in the community, right? It'd be like, you need to be in your business. So I don't see you ever going down to this tier where there's like, just community, right? Like, like, what's exactly what's going to happen to my mom? Mom's going to start. We're going to try and turn free people into customers. 00:27:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You're not. No, I am. I am. And here's why, because it's more of a kind of give back type of thing. It's not about the logical approach to getting high level clients, although it does happen because I'm that person. And I've seen other people do it where they go buy the free thing, really high level people and just go like, oh, they know what they're talking about. But then they circumvent it. They don't go by the course or do anything else like that. They're like, hey, how do I hire you, that type of thing. But for me, it's the long term play, right? It's the ascension. It might take two, three, four, five years for somebody to get to, they become a high level client, but I've been teaching them the whole time. And it's also more of instead of having a blog where it's just one-sided and or instead of sending out emails, it's just a content home. It's a content medium source, and that, for me, is more about energy. It just feels like, right? It's not different. Email would work just as well. A blog could work just as well, Facebook just as well. It's just a preference of psychologically what it feels like to put it inside of something called a community. You know what I mean? Yeah. But then are you going to go like live once a week, teeny hours, like, so I'm not doing it by myself. I'm going to do this with Maria. 00:29:10 - Dan Ryan (3) She loves this. This is what I saw in one of groups like, so one of the groups that he showed me was for Alcatraz North, and I might have been with him, to be honest, and that I could see like, you know, their calendar or whatever, what I was going to get. Yeah. So I imagine they are doing that. They're saying, hey, get in on this on a time block freebie. And then, you know, then they're in the community and you go from there. 00:29:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Um, exactly that we, and I've been talking about it with her because, so she bounces all over the place. 00:29:47 - Dan Ryan (3) That's her biggest issue. 00:29:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I hardly noticed that about her. And my biggest issue is I don't want to be on video. I don't want to do all these things, but they're really good at drawing in people fast because you can connect. Now, I don't, it's not that I mind being on video so much, it's just, I don't want to talk to myself or talk to a camera. It's just so weird. And it's so, I'll have human conversations all day long. So I want to have somebody to talk to and do it with, and I want somebody else's brain that I can access frequently. And so, anyway, if we do it with, she needs all the conversation, wants to have all the conversations. And she does marketing, I do business operations, all the mental stuff. So it's a really good blend. And that's been a huge other part of reason why I haven't done this because I'm like, I don't want to do it by myself. I've never wanted to do it by myself. I do enjoy the community. do enjoy people. love teaching, answering questions. don't even mind having live conversat

Well, I'm talking back to you realize mine was muted, and I know I unclicked it, but then I was in the wrong meeting, and so I forgot the second time.
00:00:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Can you hear me now? Dan? I hear you, I hear you. Hey, about now? Oh, I think I can do this. I hear you. Does that make it better or worse?
00:00:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you hear me?
00:00:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
nothing.
00:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is it doing nothing? I hear you.
00:00:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
hear you. wait. No, I can't do that. Well, that is a good work. Do... this.
00:01:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you hear me now?
00:01:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I totally just I was like, I'm just gonna turn up Bluetooth. I hit the right one. I meant to hit because I think when I'm in the office it bites between data and Wi-Fi.
00:01:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah, I hate what that happens.
00:01:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then but I think that ruins the connection somehow. Same thing when you're outside when I'm outside my house and it's connecting to both, I'm like, I think I killed a Wi-Fi.
00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I just and I and in my driveway I have to do that every single time. The back of my house is really good but that's because the router is much closer to it.
00:01:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. I'm just like, I will turn you up and the struggle will stop now. Mark hired me to work with China. What?
00:01:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Mark hired me.
00:01:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Left field? Yes. Well, it's probably kind of because his way of helping me, but getting something out of it too. So, but she, the business that she's working in is she's not there just as an employee. It's she gets a percentage of it. So, I mean, without crossing boundaries too much and talking about it. So, that, yeah, that. So, I'll start that next week.
00:02:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Nice. And this, what do you, what, she's working at this new job?
00:02:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I don't, I don't. Yeah. So, um, he, she's like, I don't know what he's like, you need a business coach because she basically has enough autonomy in what she's doing and has income potential besides just doing the job, right? So, their strategy involved and his introduction. in between the two of us is Tina will help you reach your goals even when you didn't know you had. That's very nice. And then listening to her, she just was stressed out, like I don't know anything and I'm like well let me break it down for you like this. I'll ask you all the questions and figure out how to make things less stressful and it will be all about you because she was like Mark has all these ideas and big and he's just go go go go and sometimes he comes down but mostly he's just got these big things and she's like I just... again just yeah but that's that's a for it's it's a first but also it was interesting because the new guy that he referred me to he's like my wife needs you i'm like i don't know that just makes me feel happy it's different it's very different i'm pretty sure it's very different not a normal stuff right totally but i've never been normal so there's that and i work with not normal so hey not normal right exactly um i yeah i'm really interested now i want to ask about um the what you call it the the plane like deal that he got going oh i don't really know the deep other than it's done i mean like the tax thing like i'm just fascinated with oh that was that was yeah yeah that was like this thing very deep deep into the trump that thing i vaguely recall
00:05:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Something about it, but you know obviously that's for a very and I remember you know people complaining about it's rich people So yeah, he leveraged that and It's a thing I know obviously it's only a thing probably for I think being out expired is pretty soon I was gonna say But once you're in you're in And then so who bought a jet Just because it almost sounded like doing it with somebody else This this is the part I don't remember and then Selco explained it to me. He's like no dude. He bought the jet and then places the jet with the company that rents the jet out Something like that, and then And then you You it's like it's sort of like the weird Those you're gonna live in if you're gonna do this if you're gonna live in Puerto Rico You have to be there six months of the year The rule for this thing is like you have to use the jail X amount of times per year Every year for the first five years for something like that And but the numbers very long. It's like you have to use it five times That's interesting and then it cat it cash flows positive cash flows 12 grand a month to mark How I mean nobody can be mad about that nope That's crazy. Well, he's playing all these big boy games now like dang dude, right?
00:06:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's Wow, Marcus just
00:07:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Conan leaps and bounds in all kinds of ways.
00:07:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's pretty amazing. Also, very much a reminder to not judge books by their E.R. covers. Uh, so, I mean, between that and like him hiring me for Chona, and then giving me Fuji, and then letting me work with his clients, like he is far and wide, just been amazing. And he's here because of you. So, I'm thinking I need to send another little gift basket, but I think that it should be something Denise gets part of, because she's the other D and D and D co. And she's losing her babies and making her happy makes you happy. So, what kind of thing could I do for Denise? Like what, like chocolate or bath bombs or something? Can I send a thank you gift to both of you?
00:08:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. I'll let you know.
00:08:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. You're so quiet.
00:08:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Again, Ariel. Really?
00:08:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:08:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
up the volume.
00:08:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I think part of it is your dynamic too, though, because like when you are part of it, part of it.
00:08:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, okay.
00:08:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. So you'll give me some ideas sometimes. Cool. Because especially with able and going, like, yeah. I've been thinking about this for a few months, actually. And I asked Daisy too. And she's like, yeah, she, I know she likes chocolate. So, but I'm like, I need to know more cause. Yeah. Um, all right. Let me go by too much. But I love my notes. Oh, so there is something. I'm not really sure what it looks like and how to create it, but I think I might have talked about it last week, but I'm zeroing in on a different type of dashboard that I want to create, which is kind of like a client profile. Um, talking about something for Mark. Um, yeah, for everybody out. Well, I, for me.
00:09:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm not not clarifying this, but that way. No, no, no, no, no. Okay.
00:09:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
measure all the things that are important and so like original goals that people have if I'm starting with them, so I can just kind of watch how they improve and track. And some of them will be financial, but some of them will just be, you know, how many hours in the office, although Mark spending a lot more than there. feel like that's actually. I mean, now, but he. wasn't and he wants to be able to not go into the office for a month or two if that's what he wants. And so anyway, but whatever people's goals are and just kind of tracking like the team goals, the revenue on top of it, but I don't so like I have all my notes for everybody, but I don't have it like I'd have to go through and remind myself what was what and I would like especially because I work with people for years to go okay this is what it was and you know the year we started and this was the next year and the next year and just kind of look at each of those things that we kind of touch on over time and just see how it's evolved but also how they've evolved because sometimes the the values change um like marks goals have gotten a little they've changed a little but they're more clear so like before it was I want to play because I want to play And then he added more things onto it and part of it became his dad wanted him to do this deal and It's kind of a thing between them like he would have taken his dad on it and But anyway, so we're just thinking about that, but I think that that would be a helpful thing and It has a multiple applications So like if we created something and I have no version to show you But there could be something like this for like mom for your artists and for any product Products you work with like okay in a very simple thing. It just be a spreadsheet There's no software needed for it because it's basically verbal extraction where we get this information in the first place in Terms of like where they're at and how they see themselves, but also the actual measurable data so we can report real data also And then you know where they are like so what was their fan base when they started with you and and what was their schedule like when they started with you? How often were they putting out songs? You know what I mean? Like all these different types of things that matter because so let's say a person is like this isn't working, well tell me how it's not working. So we really only have certain types of metrics like followers and like revenue, right? But there are other metrics that affect the metrics. So how often are you meeting with your band? How often are you writing and composing new songs? How often are you putting out new songs? How often are all these different types of things, right? And then they'll also see the correlation. So let's say you onboard somebody and you ask them these things. What's your schedule look like? What are you doing? know, what's your output, that type of stuff? And then as they are spending six months or a year with you and you're giving them systems, but part of the system is we're telling you you need to do the stuff consistently and so they just change their behavior. That behavioral change is a real value. It's not something that like you can see a direct relation and revenue but it may not happen right away but it's a real value and you can see the different things that happen as a result of it. Anyway, that's something I've been thinking about. What do you think? Any thoughts?
00:13:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So yes, I get it. I think that for you, well for anyone but for you, like yes it would be a totally different set of metrics for a band and for like a teeny client. But yeah, it totally makes sense. But so for you, it would be, I would think, that there's what you're trying to deliver to them through the coaching, right? is, you know, there's like whatever. Time for freedom up above whatever it is, whatever your metrics are, right? There's that's sort of the promise of working with Tina and getting on that whatever that name I said the other day, I love that name, the freedom, something formula, I was like, that's a good name.
00:14:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm back, I'm right that down.
00:14:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's in the notes or it's in whatever I said to John, don't even know how I said to do, but so there's that and then there'd be like the play and I think is a bad example, right? It's like they need to be, they need to be.
00:14:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that was not ultimately on my brain about that should be there to find a name.
00:14:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so you have like time freedom and lower stress, whatever there, so let's say you have these five things or that and then freedom of the framework is what you had.
00:14:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah, there you go.
00:14:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I like that because it is literally what we've been talking about that you do, right?
00:14:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're like you get people freedom and they get fulfilled, right?
00:14:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And that how they were fulfilled, right? So So even if we just take that name, right? So the freedom is you're gonna have time freedom, freedom from stress, freedom from whatever, right? there's five metrics there that you provide, which if you think about it, you could be like, these are really good things to do. And then fulfillment is the personal. Hey, I want, I want, right? So it's almost this separation between rocks, right? The rocks are the top line of tina metrics. And then the personal goals are personal rocks, right? So there's the overall rocks and there's personal rocks. And you can measure those both over span of time and you could look at them quarterly, right? You can do that, but they're also running. So implementation lives, for me, it's super simple. You just make a gravity form that has, right? The metrics are set for the level one. And then level two, you'd make a dedicated gravity form them, right? You kinda like you're gonna have a hundred clients at this level, right? are the people. people that you're only working with at this mark level. maybe you have a dozen, whatever it is. So making an individual Gravity Form for them, which is really just a duplicate of the first one. So let's say you make one for Mark, then you make one for Dan, and Dan's personal stuff is slightly different. But it's a Gravity Form for each of these. You send it out once a week via sequence, and they fill it out, it goes, it goes out a G sheet, and then you build the dashboard in a G sheet. So the G sheets tab two, the dashboards tab one, or to Google Data Studio, right? And then you can say, well, this one looks like this quarter. And then you can open it up to six months, right? You can start to look at it over time, it should be when they first start out, hey, what is your stress level one to five? You just gotta figure out what the measurement metrics are gonna be like, zero to five, what's your stress? Zero to five, what's your time freedom, right? And then they just answer that every week. And then every week, you just add them to that data's date. And you just have a sequence that peppers them. Hey, you gotta fill this out. You gotta do it every week. That's the only catch is getting them to do it. But I think they will because it's super simple. It will work on an iPhone because it's like a single page with a single form. And yeah, that would be very easy to implement. And then get Melissa to get Melissa into a pretty dark.
00:17:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was not planning. I was not trying to tap into damn brain for myself. was just sharing something that we could find a way to use for you.
00:17:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
that was amazing. Yeah, I mean, I literally saw it while you were talking. I was like, oh, I know exactly how you built this. But I mean, it's actually really good because it does. It does give you a visual representation of what's happened. This is literally what you look like. This is what your pitiful light shirt looked like, you know, six months ago.
00:17:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they're right. So that's part of it. So I feel like sometimes, like for the glens types of the world, which I, you know, whatever, but, but sometimes even the, you know, my ideal people get caught up in this isn't working, this isn't doing anything. And even Mark was like, okay, we don't really need to keep doing this because, and I'm like, well, we did get results when you did the work, but you stopped and you weren't answering questions anymore. And you were punting all the time. And so he came back, but what I think it helps do is also create, first of all, accountability level, because if people stop kind of showing up and they don't mean not coming to calls, but just not doing the work, right, or they take a dip, that will show up there. But also when they, I think it helps them buy into the process. And because we've had to. Yeah. So I have created tiny versions of this sporadically, very sporadically, which is the thing I'm really working on trying to improve and really create like a system and kind of a schedule that is still applicable to people's individual pace. But it's like, okay, here's the signal, we're here, here's the thing and kind of go that way. But anyway, but which is just showing mark, okay, look, this is or even you sometimes everybody really at some point, just like, okay, here's where we were, here's where we are, here's what you did to get there. Let's not forget to do this thing and let's continue to do that thing and whatever. it will be in a, you know, first of all, it will happen regularly. Second of all, it will happen with more clarity and the biggest thing is it will be in that visual, like we really learned the power of showing people.
00:20:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
equal numbers and data in terms that they're familiar with because of frequency because we keep showing it right because we keep interacting with that data so it becomes much more familiar so there's less of a wait what is this wait what does that wait what does that mean and then look at it instantly and they're like oh yeah okay realigned recentered moving on and also just focus for like okay this is the thing that works more of the thing that works less of all the other stuff well it's also every week they'd be sort of passively visiting or revisiting their goals which they're never doing it's never they're never thinking about it they never sit down and go oh that's right i'm trying to have less stress this week right yeah so and then when they start grading themselves then it's going to be like i am not doing this where i am we're like i am i'm crushing them You know, and whatever it is like you might be like how's your time blocking going and they'll be like I Know that would be my answer terrible. It's going terrible.
00:21:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know I Don't love it. It matters right now.
00:21:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean I do really good on the Tuesday. Went that's absolutely true I do not answer the phone. I just do whatever I want to do and those I actually worked I was telling someone about that the other day like wait what I go yeah You just you just don't answer the phone and then it's like comes a shock to you But it requires you picking it up and tapping it and if you don't pick it up nor tap it It's not answered and then you just move on. I don't want nothing the world's not burning down Whatever the phone calls about like just like I was telling Jeremy like weeks ago He was I think he was like why do you always say Thursday?
00:21:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
go because that's when I do calls Mm-hmm.
00:21:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What do you mean? don't I don't don't meet with people other than one and Thursday period End of story like occasionally occasionally on Fridays, but it's totally up to me But for the most part now, that's it's not available So oh wow good you could do this.
00:22:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No one schedules more important than yours new splash Right, and I'm gonna tell you this because okay, so a couple of things first of all Summertime with parents is a different kind of vibe not not just like for me, everybody's is a little bit different like you So I don't do major Stuff and I don't do as much accountability stuff during that time because It's more important to me That there's less stress in the in the home dynamic and just whatever so but September which is what we're coming upon like everything just goes super charge and push through and if you three and all three Q4 But the other thing let's see if I can remember where I was going just now oh okay so I've been having because okay so the thing that I was doing with Maria and still doing and we're actually gonna start talking once a week because she has lost her compass and I'm like I can hardly tell well yes I did say I know this bad um she's like the wheel of chaos they're like our dad died and he was okay so but I told her I can help you with that and so we're gonna talk regularly but um but you know I'll get to benefit from just her energy her experience and her brain and I'm dying to know if she's as legit as she makes herself out to be um I think she is and I kind of do too has made people millions and not really done well for herself yeah I have a feeling but also and I mean there's a lot to it but it's all really personal stuff that isn't appropriate for me to share, but I really think a previous marriage had a lot to do with that, though, so it wasn't just her.
00:24:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
She definitely let me know some of that.
00:24:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, so and I'm I'm not telling anything I don't think has been around enough. So, you know, that's why I'll say that little bit. But yeah, anyway, so I think that I'll help her. But what we're working on is so trying to figure out what can I do to get somebody a result quickly so that they're like, oh, she knows something I haven't been seeing and can get me some results, even if I don't hire her one-on-one, right? So group coaching and core stuff. So I picked something called timesheet homework, and I don't remember if you and I ever did it. We did it something around effective hourly rate, exercise when we like it was a few years ago, trying to figure out where your time went and where it should be going and what you're earning. Don't remember if I actually- They showed you the spreadsheet and it was called timesheet homework then. Now, I'm calling it time and profit maximizer, but what it is is you write down all the things that you do, what makes the most money, what makes you money, but is really tedious, has to be done, cannot not be done, but you hate doing it. What doesn't have to be done? We're just time being wasted, blah, blah, all that stuff. What are you great at? What do you suck at? What energizes you? What doesn't energize you? And then from that, people very clearly can figure out where they need to be delegating. What they should not be doing at all and almost, well, every single time, there's an aha of, I should be doing X way more because that's really what makes me money and I'm getting bogged down in the minutia every single time. So she went through it as we were talking about it and she had that exact epiphany. She's like, holy crap. I do almost none of what I should be doing most. But then I went to a previous, it wasn't even a client, it was so what I made my freedom systems which had this assignment in it 12 years ago and he went through it and he said this was worth the whole $97 course, 12 years ago. And it was this exercising them, so I just reached out to him. don't know if you know who Tyler Ellison is, and he helped us grow sheer strength labs with Ryan Moran and Tyler's also a person that Ryan never bothered thinking. But anyway, anyway, I was like, I remember you saying this to me once that that was that exercise alone was like life-changing and worth the price of the course. I'm like, I'm curious about staying power. I'm curious if that exercise, because my premise is that if I teach you how the fundamentals work, and I teach you how it works for you by asking you some questions and just telling you some stories that make you see how it can show up for you. If that information will stay with you and change you forever, like I think it does. That's been my experience, but I wanted that was over a decade ago and I haven't talked to him or worked with him for that long. So I wanted no staying power. He said 100 percent, it is life-changing. It affects him still, like he's still using everything I taught him. He offered to give me a video testimonial and I, so that's the thing about these fundamental processes, whatever. Anyway, so for you, this is the whole reason I said this to you though because you have, I don't know, you do get some resistance to some things. You're like, yeah, I should do that. And then you just like kind of notch lot. I don't do it, but I don't push. to you very much because you still you're always pacing something really well and to me that is the the most important thing like is if we're winning mostly winning I don't care about all the other ways things that we could be doing you know what I mean but I want I'm telling you this because I want you to buy into doing time-tracking maybe just really good just once a year for a little while or maybe twice a year because there's always so much of a shift in I don't know that there's so much of a shift and I don't know that it's always maybe because we've been working together so long and you know how time just kind of like collapses and ten years ago was like a minute ago and a minute ago was like ten years ago but I feel like sometimes in your cool things with cool people and puzzles that um and I do think that you're doing a pretty good job of prioritizing because here's where I think the priorities come up really well calls on specific days making music every week cool things with cool people not a lot of the tedious stuff so to me that that is the greater value but with the goal of getting that market share of another 71 that increase um with another 71 being the biggest lever for your freedom to continue to be whatever you want to be um do whatever you want to do and have the money for that and provide for your family and and it's gonna grow right girls are probably gonna probably get married probably have some kids who knows these days but um anyway Just thinking about a little bit more strategically, I don't think it's unstrategic, but even just more refinement basically, into where time is going for the next few years, I think that the time exercise, the time tracking and the time blocking with a little bit more specific intention, a re-evaluation of goals would be something really good for us to do next month, which is next week.
00:30:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But anyway, that's what I've been thinking about. Next month, which is next week, that's fun.
00:30:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, well, I mean, I don't want to, is it fine or is it, you know, yeah, whatever or is it like that's probably a good idea, probably useful.
00:30:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, as I've expressed multiple times throughout the years, I don't make goals, I make destinations, and then I manage to get there by saying that's where I want to go, right? Because I don't, I think my problem with goals is they usually have like a time associated with them, and I don't always to the tone associated with it, but I want the destination. So some things can be reached, you know, to switch from, I'm only doing all meetings on Monday, that was a week, right, right, to switch to, I'm only doing other calls on Thursdays, that took a little longer because I was like, I kept sort of letting it slide and saying yes to a Wednesday and yes to whatever. But then eventually I was like, no, I might do that. But that was probably a couple weeks, that making music on Fridays, right, that was like, okay, I'm, I did that with Sean, right, by meeting with Sean every Friday, I established that. So I established that through using somebody else. And then I have pretty much maintained it. mean, now I make music all over the place in Fridays. So, yeah, I'm, you know, I was just thinking about it like yesterday. It was like, I let something But that I was working with those dent guys and then the owner came back and then I just told my buddy out You know what? I don't want to do this And he's like what I go. Yeah, just don't want to do this. What you mean? it really boils down to like it's not my idea Therefore, I mean it is but it's not it actually I said it's not really my idea Although it kind of is but really the problem is When it was when I was working with you as the person of the outside, it's fine But the only way this works is if it's my idea and then I have a willing participant And a willing participant has to provide feedback. They have to answer questions They have to use they have to use the things. Yeah, and if they're not gonna use the things It's just not gonna work So I was like if you come back into the fold if and if that's if that's nine months from like great We'll pick it up in nine months, but I'm not working. I'm not working anymore. I'm done Even like okay And whether he comes back or not, I don't care. Right. I don't really care. And then it's like we're getting closer and closer to, you know, fan flowies. We got a couple more things. just sent the web. I'm going back and forth with the dudes right now. I'm building the website template. great. And now I'm trying to get them to do this version for me. Let's see. I literally just sent him all your emails for me on the phone. Hopefully he understands what I'm saying. But it sounds like he does. And then it's like, okay, if we can roll that out, that's where I'm like, all right. I want to then, and then I still need bases. Eric is like, no dude, it's happening. This is really happening. It's like cool. So those guys are just banging away on code with rank. They didn't even meet this week. They're like, we're just doing code. That's fine by me. You guys all agree. You and Frank agreed. like, don't let's not be let's just stay in Jira. It's like, okay, cool. So that's going. Yeah, he hooked up Jira. I've never used it, but it's for coders. It's code or project management. Oh, okay. Yeah, it's like a whole other thing. Very interesting company worth a gazillion in these two dudes start and also started. So it's like, I'm like, all right, but I mean, I'm still it's still the same thing. Another 71 grow another 71 which PS is now up to 3.5 million ARR. So it's definitely grown this year. My stupid frickin some of my GTM stuff is not working. Some of stuff I wanted to do is maybe not gonna work. I'm going back and forth with one of Mercy's four guys who's great. They definitely know their stuff. So but I also am not working on that today. So I'm still working out some of that stuff. Mushy did do my new customer thing, and it's exactly what I wanted, so we'll make sure that that's tracking correctly. And then I was working, I'm just, I'm still trying to, I gotta get that tracking in place, and then figure out, you know, if I could figure out where the new customers come from. And then we're still dealing with this weird year. And then I think Bobby, Bobby sent out something next year. There's 25 school releases next year, which is called The Hook. Yeah, that's insane. like, okay. And those are always good for us.
00:35:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I was like, okay.
00:35:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Next year could be great. And then I started, I think I'm getting sales on some of the new products and some ads I put up. The SEO's going really good with a curd. Um, yes, I mean. I'm still just focused on like, I really just want to do like, another 71 basis and think blowing, or mom, right? And that's it, if I can get those three, yeah, any semblance of whatever. And then if Kamala gets up high, it Kamala gets elected and they put this cap game thing in place, we are not selling another 71, so yeah, we know the red event, so we'll just sit on that.
00:36:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good job.
00:36:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We will not be paying you any additional types of revenue, that is 40% F you.
00:36:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's crazy. it's not case in point, our conversation evolves so much, but to the point of just the principles, priorities, values, whatever, like, is the foundation, like that's the initial foundation, that's the first fundamental thing that we talk about, because for me, okay, for example, morning routines, and I talked to Mark about gratitude, mostly because he was Eor and just woo.
00:37:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Which is pretty much gone now. I know, I know, but let me let me get through this whole train of thought because I'm not I'm just saying talk, flash in and losing it really fast. Oh, yeah.
00:37:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, yes, it is mostly gone, but that didn't work for him, right? It was not his value. So he had to have something that was his value. The dog was his value. old day was his value spending time with her. And so he took her for walks. Well, she's gone and he's still walking and it was crazy that he's like, I walked five miles. was like, that's like nine miles, but I was like, yeah, that was that was wild. So but anyway, but you when it so that thing, right, is you're like, I don't, I don't set goals. But but you kind of do their. just not most people's goals. Yours are cool things with cool people. That's not a destination and it doesn't have a date. But it does have a spectrum, the spectrum of the quality of the cool things and the cool people. And people have fallen off the spectrum on that path. And like Francesca, like Glenn, things like that. Like this thing that you're doing with the guy, the dent thing, it is a refinement in terms of clarity about what you want and what you don't want. You do three examples. The Monday meetings, only having calls on particular days. I can't remember what the other things were anymore, because my brain. But everything that you listed, I'm like, we had a conversation. And in the middle of that, because you're like this, each of these, three things took a week. And I said, in the middle of a conversation, you're like, okay, this is what's gonna happen. You made a decision and then you pulled the trigger. And then next week, I was talking to you, you're like, yeah, I did this. And I was like, what the? But it still came from conversations about things like, where is your time going? And how do you feel about where time is going? So it's really not very different. The only difference is I have through and do that. And, you know, time blocking, like, I don't really do time blocking. I don't do it in my calendar. I do it mentally. And it's very similar to you because my value is, I don't want to live in a calendar, even though I'm aware of it. But I am looking at it constantly. But I choose the things that matter most. And then I make sure that those, like, those are my big rocks, right? Those are the things that get the most time. there's room for other things, there's room for other things. But what matters most always is getting done. So anyway, yeah, so we could just like have a little bit of a conversation, go through the exercise. What I think would happen is rather than like sending any more specific goals, it's just an evaluation of is the way that you're spending your time right now, and I'm not talking about time blocking, but case in point, the example of where's your time going, where's your energy going. I don't want to have calls on these certain days. It's really me off. I'm not going to do that anymore. So that's the kind of conversation I'm more thinking about having with you is a modified version. But there's a foundational process that I use that helps me to be able to kind of facilitate that conversation, but you're still the one that shapes it based off of how you want, how things matter to you.
00:41:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. The only thing I would say is that full of things with cool people is a principle using your terminology. That's not a principle.
00:41:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's really principle.
00:41:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. And I do have no drama principle. Oh, yeah. And then the goals are like row 1% a year. You know, work on program, yeah. Yeah.
00:41:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Goals. 1%. I already know that I'm just writing them down again, because then I'm going to create my thing.
00:41:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah. And it's like a 1% market.
00:41:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:41:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. I know what it was. Yeah.
00:41:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I'm reminding myself. Oh, yeah, which means being clear on what the market is and all that. Yeah. Principle slash values. Yeah. So drama thing is a big thing. Cool things with people. Solving puzzles is another one though. I feel like that's kind of both a value and a goal. It's that you always have a good puzzle to work on. Because I don't agree that goals, OK, goals are specific, measurable, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, But, I don't think that they have to have, I don't think they have to be finite-based.
00:42:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes, because it is the T time. don't even know what it is, right? Time-based or something. What? The T in smart is time.
00:42:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's time-based.
00:42:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right the 1% is for you
00:43:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It just doesn't have an entire specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time bound, but for me, the time bound that just sounds so risky, right? But for me, the time is not relevant if the goal is growth and expansion in that thing, which is how I set my goals. It isn't that I want to arrive at a destination. It's that I want to be further than I am now, and I consistently want to be further than I am now, because my destination is probably greater than I can even comprehend.
00:43:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, you could twist it, right? Tweak it and be like, yeah, it's time bound. And you could say with regard to not a deadline, right? So it's time bound in that you're going to look at this every quarter. You're going to look at this every month, right? So you could sort of, it doesn't, the time bound doesn't have to be a deadline. I guess, I mean, I just don't have deadlines for the most part.
00:44:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Exactly.
00:44:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Or the big ones.
00:44:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And one of the things that I tell people too, especially if we have something that's kind of obscure and a lot of the things that we want are obscure, especially when you're paying attention to this energy and when you're just like, stuff is happening and I'm just here for it, right? But you're really intentional. You're on purpose, you're doing the work. It's not nothing, but there's a little bit more intangible that's happening. so I like to tell people don't, you know, look back from a year from now. What was life like a year ago? What are you more clear on now? What is improved now? What are you more confident about now? do you have? What less stress do you have now? How's your schedule better? Like all of these different things. If you look back a quarter from now. Six months from now, sometimes it's not that big of a deal, but a year from now, a year ago, right? There's almost always some things that you can pick out and go, this is so much better than that. This is how much I've grown since a year ago, which is one of the benefits for me of getting to work with people so long as I can look at that and go night and day difference from last year on this or that or whatever. Anyway, reinforcing the not a deadline, but more like a journey thing. Yeah, okay. So you have to everything really for me for like where you're at with Mercer. This is almost being done and let's go release things that's gonna be where like, did you confirm that? How, what did you hear?
00:45:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Where did you hear it from? Hey, I CPA puts it out, right? they run them so that they they released the 2025 schedule. So he like sent a screen cap of the year or whatever.
00:46:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's like the thing, huh? That's crazy.
00:46:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. then, you know, is that a double? What is that? Oh, God.
00:46:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:46:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
triple? I think it's more than double. like double plus one, roughly.
00:46:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's crazy.
00:46:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And well, and then they've been down because of all the code.
00:46:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:46:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, yeah, it's certainly more than this year by a mile. I mean, there's only been like half that many this year. It's seven or eight maybe so far. Or not even that many so far. There's one coming up and then there's one in October or no, the next one is not until October. So there'll be like a two month month and a half and nothing. Whereas with 25, it's averaging two a month, which is Definitely not all of it. It used to be these would be even more sparse Back in the day That's when we did these huge Sailed days.
00:47:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, they probably realized that there's a similar correlation for them too And I think it's a result of having six sections now and not four Yeah Except yeah, I'm a success to Stacy because I look across as something from her and I don't think she's seen it Okay, so I'm back Adler separate Do have a recipient there I Don't know what it's talking about Okay, um, perfect wedding timeline.
00:48:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
How's that going? So, Abhishek has been sending Norio all bugs, and Norio said that he thinks he'll be ready for some beta testers. Next month. Uh, the I sent Greg, I think Eric built it. So, we have the seething chart things. As Norio, alright, what are we doing? How do I get a lead from a seething chart over? He explained that's Eric and I. Eric, I'm pretty sure he definitely is working on it because I saw some stuff today and was like, that's going to be Eric. Um, so this morning I sent the design, the layout and design ideas to Greg with the scene chart site. Norio's like, you can search and read these now. Then that's what I will do. So, Greg got that and then, we'll follow that up with Rob. I haven't really thought about the site for that, but it's going to be a better site than what we have for the current version because we're licensing, you know, it's not off. So I've never been motivated to try to generate a lead for the other side or anything like that. If they happen to happen, if they don't, they don't really care. But my plan is to generate leads to the free seating chart site, get their wedding date, all that stuff. Renau will stick it into the Wolfr Active Campaign and, you know, market is free seating chart, put them into a drip sequence, but depending on their wedding date, they'll go into the app, they get complete access to the even chart, and then they'll see that, you know, it has, you know, online feature, but it's grayed out, but they can purchase not from, I don't think they can purchase from within the app. But they can link to purchase and then it will unlock the whole app for them based on their current user name password So yeah, super interesting to see right now to talk to anybody just go generate leads Yeah Yeah then just put to you know put the other the map on that.
00:50:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, there's the pop-up all I can so Every time we've converted to selling and we being different clients Selling like up selling inside of a membership area with that like you can see the other things that you don't have access to Either it's great out over the lock screen and then you click on it goes to the sales page or a Java script You know unlock is here whatever Compulsions so that's that just increased exponentially
00:51:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We need to auto-expire them on their wedding table.
00:51:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you going to tell them now, should I give you a reminder for Stacy?
00:51:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
A reminder. So, Bobbi, wait what?
00:51:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so like the menu items is here.
00:51:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He did it. He said it to me. Yeah, he's like, here it is. I probably didn't look at it.
00:52:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you forward it? So you need to, I'd really like to I don't think I only have a general and idea of money execution channel that I am part of.
00:52:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Huh? It's not in my slack. He said, it's a world I have to go find it.
00:53:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK.
00:53:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's what it's.
00:53:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Super eyes. What's the status?
00:53:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, so they don't get it. And they're like, they really, they just want their cake and eat it too. And I'm like, yeah, that's not going to happen. So they, we had like a couple exchanges. then they wrote me back like another lying email and I glanced at it and I'm like, I ain't going to have permission. But it boiled down to like, they, they, they think the value is in the effort and work that they've done and the quality of the code. I'm like, yeah, no, that's not how it works. wish it worked like that. So then, and then they're like, oh, you know, and then you're going to become. I'm a competitor, so I'm trying to figure out. I haven't put a lot of thought into it, but some thought into it. So they wanted, I guess I'll prioritize this. They wanted 420 grand for a copy of the code. I'm like, are you high? Like, what are you talking about? I go, that's 38x. Nobody gets that. Nobody gets that kind of multiple. So then I told them, no, your business is like stub, 100,000 a year. Your value is more based on a seller's discretionary earnings formula. Here's that. Go ahead and run that. And PS, the X on that is one to two based on your gross revenue.
00:54:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:54:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, I mean, it's not even, it's worth, you know, max 20 grand max as it is. And then they're like, well, you know, then you're going to cannibalize us. I'm like, cannibalize what? You don't have anything. So they just believe in the idea, right? you don't. You really don't, as if you did, you wouldn't have a job. Right? you're want your want to outdoors. Like I'm not going to say that obviously. Right? all right. Right. What I pointed out is like, there's also the risk of overnight you could be shut down. Overnight. Right? This is against the terms of service service, um, basically. And you can be shut down overnight. Payment gateway could be shut down overnight. You guys experienced it twice. Business shut down. So I'm like, there's not, it's very risky. So I have to figure out a way where like, they can participate in the upside. So it's either like, okay, you, you give me a hand. This was my original offer. I want a non-commercial license meaning I won't sell it. So I won't sell it and therefore I'm not competing with you. You can sell it. I'm not going to sell it. I'm only and I'm only going to and I'll pay you X per month guaranteed. But it could be like I do a commercial license and then so they get X per month guaranteed and then they get a percent of account like I'd have to figure out a formula like all right I'm gonna pay you a thousand bucks a month and four thousand bucks a month that gets me 500 active users and then when I get over 500 active users you get 5% of everyone over 500 you know I mean like something like that and then and then we decide on a value like we have to get a real value so that at any time I can buy my copy. I'll pay you to customize it which is 20 grand. So pay 20 grand, I'll pay you thousand bucks a month and now get me 500 users and then I'll pay you on if it goes gangbusters you guys get to Participate on the upside and but then at any time I can buy that code base off you for a fixed amount And or we decide to fix them out and I say every time I pay you I'm buying it Right, so you're gonna get 200 grand least don't yeah Yeah, yeah, it's like a lease on sort then you'll get the 200 grand, but at any time I could accelerate that So if we're down to a value of 190 I could just give you 190 and I'm out So something like or I mean but then yeah, so something like that and I haven't obviously I've thought about it a little but I haven't thought about it a ton and I just It's like there's no that the you know effect of hourly rate There's no effect of hourly rate for me to be like I gotta get back to those guys then If you add into the mix that mark supposedly and see this, believe them, they somehow stumbled upon running ads, I'm not sure this is exactly right, but I think this. So they found out that if you log into Instagram desktop, not that after your phone, and you boost a post through the desktop, in some way that's different than definitely different than running it out on Facebook and, you know, doing it that way, but also different from boosting the post internally within the app. They don't know how or why it's different, but it's different in that they're getting followers now for 30 cents, and super as gets a follower for 19 cents. So I'm like, that's not a bad trade-off, right? And it's completely legal, like a better term. So they figured that out like like over the weekend. So I think they've been doing it for a couple of days. And now they're like, all right, now let's do the process of manually DMing them. So part of me was like, the part that Instagram doesn't like is if you auto DM someone, and we are not doing that, we never done that. That was what I was going to have to supervise that into it. So then I was like, well, what if we just created an auto DM-er, right? So if we created an auto DM-er that doesn't look like an auto DM-er, right? And we'll be really smart about it, have it just randomly send DMs, switch the DMs up, but I gave that to the JD Funnels dude, I thought Spotify out there said, hey, look into this. The only thing I think the only problem with it is I think it needs to be a desktop app, because it can't be on a server. So this builds back to, and maybe we don't need to build super eyes, maybe we just need need to build an auto dm or app that's on your desktop and it just does that so you run ads and use that and then that's totally free like it's it's included with whatever oh yeah and then I download the dm or yes I haven't thought it through that frontal right now so I like oh wait that's it right there that's what we need to do and then we've got the other devs that I found before for the super ride but when I was going to build my own thing that might be the plane I'm probably causing a couple hundred bucks super simple and then we could just test it internally hmm it's a good Dina I told you my magic is asking questions everybody does that be lifting the sides yeah well that's little thing right I don't no one sits around and asks me what I'm doing
01:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
or why you're doing it.
01:01:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yeah, but that's actually the play right there. You know what? That's not going to cost $420,000. Probably not going to cost a grand.
01:01:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I mean, there's so many different angles to it and it's like, well, I can be your competitor that you get money from or I can be your competitor that you don't. Not that you're actually the competitor, but you know what I mean? And there's other things. There's so many angles to it, but sometimes narrow minds can see the light and sometimes they can't. But regardless, you've got opportunities for days. There's so many different ways around it.
01:01:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's okay. It's okay. have a call at 1.30 and thirdly..s.
01:01:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We met with Josh at eight.
01:02:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And he, uh, he's like, yeah, we can do that. He, it's unreal how good he is. Mark and I, so I like, Mark, you need to go this tall because you get the bookkeeping side. And so we walked through it, you know, over a half hour or so. And Josh is like, yep, yep, yep, we can do that. We can build that and then Mark out of nowhere. I don't know if this is from, I think I only sent it to you. And I sent it to him too, where I was like, hey, we got to work on like the on track, I'll track dashboard. I thought that was just you, but maybe he was on there. He brought that up because I want to build the mega marketing dashboard or something and just like, that's a great day. That's a good, good job, Mark, the MMD. So Josh is going to build the thing that we wanted to talk about. And then this MMD and then he showed us some apps that he has that are super cool that I'm like, I don't know if Mark got it. I'm like, it's so funny when I look at something, I go, oh, that's interesting.
01:03:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, if it's ever possible, I would love to be on a call with Joshua. I can just see it firsthand and download all of that. Or if you have a recording, cause I only have like this tiny glimpse into what he can do. But, um, like, that sounds amazing. Instead, but he could do more than maybe I could ask other questions. That would be that we've never had an option to get a lot of this stuff. Like we've been working with Mark for over three years and it took all of this time to find Josh. And who knows what Josh was doing. Speaking of like synergy and divine stuff and things are happening that we can't control or even bring into play. We couldn't make Josh appear and Josh have his skill and his knowledge. We had no control all of that. All we could control is what do we do when we need a Josh?
01:03:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You know what I mean? And what's crazy is that he was in the middle of this random video. I was watching and I was like I had to find that guy so it was like that's how How did you find him? I was I was researching something about Lidify because I'm like I'm not doing this I'm not gonna do it. Mark could do it and then whatever and then They were like in he was like being interviewed I don't know but it was like an interview YouTube video with like four views and I watched it and I was like Who is this guy and then I figured out one of my zoomed in on the screen Or they said the firm or they said his last name. I was like that's it's such a newbie last name and I found him Through his face and then I you know them. Okay, man.
01:04:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you do this and he's okay? Insane when you think about just I know you being you, which is let me go look at that and and That you don't disregard somebody because they've got like almost no views because some of the smartest people have like no Following on Facebook and they are insanely smart and very good at teaching how to do certain things, whatever.
01:05:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
anyway, he literally was on the call going, this guy is such a score. This morning, I was like, he is such a score. So quick, the thing that he showed us was we built this app for referring out his doctor refer or I'm sorry, it's for referring to doctors, right? So think of it in that context, like, yes, you have your doctors that you're referring to, but this is also to maybe refer to a new doctor. It's integrated into Lidify. And let's say that you're like, oh, this person means a pain management doctor. It goes to Google, you put in their, it pulls their addressing from their matter record. And then on the, so that's on the left side on the right side to Google map. And it pulls up all the pain management clinics in around that area. And I'm like, wait, what?
01:05:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, isn't that how you would build your doctor network, Mark? it's also how doctors find out their competition and that's very relative to the new plan I have yeah so I was like wow that's slick and then this other thing he had is this auto mailer like physical mail and you yeah and it integrates with i don't know did you recall no i don't know if did it was his car no it was it's google google so i don't even know if you ask if it's recorded yeah yeah or he would send a video on it okay um i want to hear about all of that stuff because whatever we can use for mark also mark is in business with the client that he gave me and there's probably room for dan in there too and something in terms of marketing because that's not where they should be spending their time like he does his own seo like why are you doing your own seo like the money you make that that's dumb but also, you know, you can always just find great SEO, but I'm pretty sure he does not do great SEO. Anyway, there's just holy crap, Josh. Yes, I wanna know more about Josh. And if you have more calls, either please record it or can I come because I wanna see that brain?
01:07:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I don't normally talk to him. This he requested, and I was like, Mark's gonna be there. Mark made it sound so complicated, and I was like, I don't think I was that complicated.
01:07:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the point, yes.
01:07:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I was like, and then, but it does, it's gonna involve manual labor.
01:07:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, Mark. You're crazy. That's exactly what he ate.
01:07:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right, your employees are gonna actually have to do tasks, weekly, gasp.
01:07:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yes, that is the issue. Anyway, okay. That is awesome. I forget what you realized you figured out, but I know you figured it out, and you won't forget when it comes to what you figured out was supervised.
01:08:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, do you mind? Yeah, totally. I need to build our own.
01:08:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, because I can go back to my notes and get that if you need a reminder.
01:08:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I got it.
01:08:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, well, sir. Okay, don't forget ideas for like a gift basket. That's pretty much going to be all about Denise. We'll probably figure out something for you too.
01:08:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay, It's the other D&D call.
01:08:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got two air pods and you probably drop them in the dog bowl.
01:08:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, but they're the ones that everyone's complaining about. No, actually, that's already broke.
01:08:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm on another set.
01:08:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Mary is using the ones that you got using the one.
01:08:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's one that works.

Hi, hi, I was just gonna see if you're coming. Yeah, sorry. I don't know how to make a decision. I'm in Mark's office. Okay there. I think it's charges. Okay. Oh. Okay.
00:00:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I hear you.
00:00:24 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)

00:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know you're probably on the laptop.
00:00:37 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Okay. It was kind of crazy. There's a lot of things. I just need to tell you because I'm just gonna have a verbal guy. We are here in moment.
00:00:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm ready for it.
00:00:52 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Well, it started Sunday. I feel like slipping fall in front of. Starbucks, like literally. My knee buckled and I don't even know what happened. It's like it happened so fast and then actually it's like too mucha and it just, it could have been worse, right? could have been worse. So my knee still hurts from that. It happens that Sunday and and um the matcha I saved though. It had the core. It tore me in my mom and I would say 95%. Can you imagine? And I fell flat on my face right here but oh thankfully the face for some reason didn't have abrasion but my knee is anyways. So I would mark how his IT band is hurting, right? A pair of this. Yeah so I actually did trigger point injection to him two days ago. is it two days ago And I was on my way to work. I got shaken up. I, you know, we have to bring by the police report and bring my car to the chop. So I, you know, I just basically, I feel yesterday. I did my telemedicine, but I'm on my way to the clinic, so I didn't go into the clinic. And I was kind of really shaken up. And I just feel bad in the way, because I didn't see my hospital patients yesterday.
00:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, a patient.
00:03:35 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, I saw them this morning. They're so, I was busy already starting this morning. I started at six thirty. I was busy because I saw the patients in the hospital call my phone calls. It's done. The notes is not done, but I finished what I needed to do for the orders. And then I went and visit one of the law firms that. gave me cases. So kind of solidified that I gave them cupcakes. just to kind of thank you. And then I met the main lawyer, which I never met him before. He's the owner of the group.
00:04:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And, you know, is this three James?
00:04:16 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
No, no, it's not six James.
00:04:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's Havas Law. Oh, okay.
00:04:19 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Havas. So he introduced me to Mike, which is the brother. But this is the main lawyer, the owner, the lawyer, the group. And, you know, we talk a little bit and he's like, you know, this is Mark Sweet's wife. we talk and said, okay, we'll send you more. So that's a good, I bought like four dozen cupcakes. There's apparently there's four to five of them. like, I hope this is enough. And then I pick up my mom because she had an epidural done. And I'm here. So I promise it's 30 till now. And like, I need to like, And then neighbor stopped me because he's like, because I was busy and so we tried for a moment, but then he caught me and so it's like I need to go to have an appointment, zoom. far it's that, but my notes have been like on time, it's just that yesterday I got I know I have four notes, I got a little bit derailed. I'm already in pain from Sunday, the thing happened, but I show up today to whatever needs to be done and then tomorrow is the sweet James. But still we have dinner back to back today, tomorrow, but I still go into the hospital and my phone calls, I still have my patients and I just got a new one. So it's kind of. I'm getting there. It's getting busy. The good thing is Dr. E hired a PI coordinator full-time like for his, you know, for the practice. It's not going to be remote, but he's full-time, which is really what we need is phone calls, patients, calling lawyers, you know, that's what we needed. So, I mean, that's good.
00:06:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:06:30 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Because, honestly, at this point, I do not know what, I mean, I know, but because it's not, it's still very new and I'm tracking the cases that's coming specifically through me, but I'm also taking care of his. And per mark, apparently, it's going to be all throughout the percentage for all PI. you know, take care. just feel a little bit frazzled because of the back to back kind of incident on me.
00:07:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:07:06 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
And it's just um I'm in pain like I um I will have my hair done later for the dinner. So I don't know what I'm like. feel like kind of all over a little bit like I can feel it but that's but there's something that happened yesterday and today that I was really other than the business side. I was telling Mark. Mark has multiple wins too on his on his yeah. Yeah. good. Um so he's balancing out what's happening with us. We're both in pain. But anyways I was telling this you know trying to do the positive and what happened and I message him that I was supposed to message you too yesterday. and then of course the accident happened and I got derailed. I'm just I just stayed on home and I just and this is the one week I didn't check on you I was thinking about that today because this week has been nuts for me and but not in your way oh yeah I was like I suck I did not check on Chona at all today and then you tell me this and I feel even more it was it was no anyways I wanted to tell one win I think that makes me again makes me feel that it's really really nice to make money obviously you know I would want to make more and fine for next year so really big busier and make more but like I have a patient that's an addict and got in the hospital it got into an accident while he's high he's my age and he had surgery so now he's in rehab so he's taking this specific medication pain medication that we give for patients who are addicts and it's called buprenorphine and it kind of hitting two birds with one stone in a way so and you know he's homeless you know he's just so there's a lot of issues right and then two nights ago he was like from his heart I was like I don't want to go home because I'm in the hotel and I'm surrounded with people who are eating drugs and I don't want to be on fentanyl because I don't want to die you know you know these things it's like and I talked to the manager I ordered case management social work to have sources resources for him to go home this is going home either today or tomorrow and apparently they don't have those resources so I research on my own and I found one this was yesterday before I go to morning and I was able to find one and it's a perfect quick match program that I was talking to that doctor I said I already started dissipation on this but I can only give five days word of medication. Anyways to make the story short I told the patient this is the number you call and he called yesterday and I talked in today and he was very very thankful yesterday and today and I was just these are the reasons why I do this. These are so so much better the idea of helping someone maybe obviously identifies up to him but to hear it from someone like that asking for help is literally like crying and in the beginning actually he literally could save his life. Yes so that he's like crying and he's actually hard to deal with not a lot of people wanted to because you know there's addiction component there's pain component and you know and he felt like I'm not listening to him you know all those very difficult type of personality it would since I've used in the end to tap back. So, you know, I was telling him he's like, thank you so much, he's just like, and I was telling Mark that this, this is why I do what I do because it, and it just, it just feels so good. And again, I'm not the type of person that would linger on a compliment, but I was telling Mark, this is like, this is why I do this.
00:11:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not about compliment. There is, so Nick Frankel, man starts for happiness, right? We, as human beings, need meaning in our life, we need purpose. of us are satisfied to our souls without purpose. And that purpose I have without exception, never seen anything where that purpose isn't tied to the service of other human beings. And so, it makes perfect sense. how do we perceive the success of those goals? How do we perceive that purpose? It's through the signals that we receive from other people which generally look like gratitude, expression of gratitude, for the service that we've rendered. So, you know, there's this whole weird thing and I think and I have to say this because I don't know how to separate the spiritual element from, you know, the life element, but there is real good and there's real bad, there's real light, there's real dark. And so, you know, God wants us to do good, but the real enemy to good wants us to not do good, but rather than be overt about it, he's very subtle. And so he'll do things like make us think like, you shouldn't talk about the good that you did because that's being arrogant and you're doing things for the wrong reason. Or like, for instance, I'm going through a battle. for my children right now and some things are happening and they're happening publicly and I am amazed that the lack of people speaking up and standing up and they're like yeah but I don't want to offend and I don't want to do this but you'll allow for wrong to be done and you'll allow for that hurt to be done but you don't like you don't want to take part in it like so you are taking part you're watching and by not standing up you're doing something and so that's like what the adversary does is he calls good bad and bad a good and and anyway so it's it's good for you to notice that it's not about a compliment it's a signal of a successful thing that you did you didn't just serve him you served him in your heart right there's a time you know maybe a month or two ago when you were kind of judging yourself for wanting this to be all about money and you're like it's just about the money and you like you're That's how you had seen yourself for a moment. I'm like, no, it's that but It took very specific instances for you to even acknowledge that in yourself you had to have this a signal like this right going to the hospital and Having a specific experience that you can recognize and that was so clear to you That you had joy for being able to take care of them that you could speak honestly and go Actually, this is really what matters to me because I can't you Jonah Like if you saw somebody in pain and they're on the street and you're there I can imagine you walking by and not trying to help them and you're not gonna get paid It's not about the money It's just that you have gifts that you purposely received like you you went to training To be able to heal and help other people you chose that And then you give it so I think it's I think we can be humble and it's still acknowledge the the goodness in our
00:15:00 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Because I don't think it's right to deny our goodness.
00:15:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:15:04 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
You know what I mean? Right. And, to be honest, feel, I mean, technically it's not, it's not really my, like, my job. already put the orders in, get a referral, and then the case manager or the coordinator is like, we don't do that. We don't have that here. He needs a primary referral. I said, that is actually a good idea and good practice for regular patients. This is not a regular patient. This is a homeless patient who is an addict who is asking our help, like, you know, there's a, there's one of my favorite scriptures and it says, um, if a man asked for a coat, give him your jacket also.
00:15:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if he asked you to walk with you in a mile, walk with him, twine, walk with him too. Basically, whatever somebody asks you for, give them twice what they ask you for. or because that's what God would have us do. So like, anyway, just, it's, I think it's good.
00:16:07 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Do you already? reeling on that high. And then, because I talked to him yesterday, I said, I just talked to these people in this program. I'm giving you this number, call them right now.
00:16:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was happy to talk. And then I will come see you this afternoon.
00:16:23 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Ah! That's why I told him, then I didn't come. And then I'm glad that he's still there today when I saw him. And he, you know, I said, but it's the car act of conversation. And he was very, very thankful, you know, that's a good resource. He was already thankful yesterday. He's very thankful today. So it's good. It's a, I'm definitely holding on to that. And I told him, you know, I told him good luck on, you know, because again, the end of the day, it's his choice, but I'm just, I'm hoping the best for the best. is really, really hard. It's a disorder, so it's like, yeah, and then for him, for an addict to ask for help, that's like huge. Well, and it's come morbid with several other disorders, generally speaking, so yeah, so it's when I talked to the, and then, you know, I'm a little disappointed with the coordinator. I talked to her too, and she said, it's kind of natural on about it. I'm sure she's seen that a lot, but sometimes that's why actually I think it's good that I'm doing clinic and hospital and different because it helps me to sensitize a little, I mean, since it's that sensitized, remove myself, because I remember when I was an ICU nurse, death had become so common, like I remember taking care of a patient, like this was a lot. gosh, how long have I been a nurse? Been long time. So I was in, I have a patient that's homeless and dying and I'm right there in the room because he doesn't have anyone. I just feel like he needs, there needs to be someone with him when he's dying. And then outside the nurses are laughing. It's like, that's the time, honestly, that I said, going to go back to school because I need, I don't want, you get, is that the right time? So I need to step out and do other things.
00:18:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, desensitize or dissociate. And I actually think it's more dissociate because it depends. So for me, when we're desensitized, we're just kind of numb all the time. Whereas if we dissociate, like, I can disconnect from pain without numbing myself to other things. can also choose to allow it in and allow myself to feel. Whereas I think when we're desensitized, you just don't even notice you're not aware Anyway, it's probably semantics little bit, but either way. Yeah, that you have to be able to compartmentalize What's happening and It's a lot.
00:19:19 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
I don't I don't see how trauma workers could do anything else and yeah, there's definitely trauma right right um But yeah, so far I was still able to look again. I just dug the rail this Two days. I have even with that. have four notes Yeah, that's it. I'll compare exactly come here. Well, except for today.
00:19:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm talking about yesterday.
00:19:44 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
just hope you But that's pretty amazing. That is that's what I thought told too.
00:19:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was two weeks ago.
00:19:51 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
You were 99 Behind the You got 99 problems in a wreck wasn't one Yeah, it's a Monday Hey, I finished mine. Oh, it's definitely good. And there's, I just have another case that come in and I'm, I just need to make sure to have a plan next year to, because it's sporadic. Like, I, I need to be more a little bit more flexible in terms of, oh, have a patient can be see, you know, this patient like last week I did that for Mark's case. He told me at 4.30 at Thursday. I said, we have a patient that lived five hours away. We're setting up transportation. Can you do procedure? Can you see the patient do procedure tomorrow and then have an order consult? And we were able to make that happen for that patient. The next day, which is, you know, we just did a telemedicine orthopedic consult, but we did two procedures so that it feels good. But I just want to try to say is, There's a lot of flexibility that I will need to have, which I think I do have on a Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Monday, Tuesday, I have clinic time in the afternoon. But again, the hospital is very flexible. I can either go in the morning or late. Night. That's why I can do this. Bye. Sorry. Stay safe. Yeah. you have some downtime coming for the holidays that you can look forward to? So I may have told...
00:21:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know you're going to Japan, but I don't know like if you're going to be...
00:21:56 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
We're going to Japan, but I told them. like I thought I liked the idea of having a little bit of you know work like phone calls it's all telemedicine and then I was looking at the sketch I told them you can give me telemedicine so so far there's like 10 which is really not much which we'll see this is the first well actually it's not the first time because when we went to New York I have a few telemedicine too so we'll see because Marcus is the same he's awake early work doing phone calls and he works and I was like I can hear him so I thought just like what am I gonna do yeah so this is like yes and then we're leaving Paris January so I also already notified the office I'm out of the office you can give me telemedicine on this date um but there's gonna be downtime you know because we just have you at least won't be community
00:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
thing. So that's got to add some rest to it.
00:23:02 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Right. Yeah, definitely. And it's two weeks in Japan. This is the first time that we're doing Christmas, you know, by country and just family. Right. So we set up my mom to go to my brother in Kentucky. So she will leave Monday. That way she's not alone. Yeah. My mother is here, but you know, they don't really celebrate Christmas like that.
00:23:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I just don't.
00:23:32 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
They're Jewish, right? They're Jewish.
00:23:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I always tell them because his sister decorates Christmas tree. They're not.
00:23:43 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
And then on stage, well, Easter, his mom decorates. Like they're not very, you know, obviously I didn't have to convert. And our wedding is a fusion of our tradition. Yeah. So yeah. So, you know, it's not. I'm Catholic. Yeah, we have a fusion of that. Um, I'm excited. I'm excited for next year. I'm ready to I have, I'm ready. Although I know I have to voice it out and admit I have self-insecurities, whether I'm a human physical or like how I present myself. I feel I'm not that experienced and lean. I don't know the lingo, but you know, like Mark said, the opportunity knocks that you just have to just just go and then figure it out. So, which is what I've been doing and Dr. E is, you know, now we have a full time full time person that's going to be so that is good. Um, yeah, I'm, you know, I still I wanted to make sure Oh, oh, I wanted to give you feedback. So I the haba slaw, which is Marc Andrews me.
00:25:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
this is who I visited today.
00:25:09 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
And my haba is the partner or the brother of the lawyer introduced me to Tyler, which is his his main person. He's a he's manager. So we definitely click. And we talk. And I asked her like, I wanted to make sure that, you know, that we're flexible. Obviously, we're doing for the patient, but you know how it works, like trying to, because I'm also navigating this as I'm new. just told her what our practice is. And I asked, you know, based on the two patients, you know, and she said, no, you're, I like you have your notes is because I do don't want them. And he said, it's very simple to the point. So, she likes it, said, if there's anything, know, I'm flexible, we'll always get a total worth possible with the price range, know, we can talk about that. So, again, this is a new thing for me because it's, there's that business side. I feel like I can, I can be, I can like, I feel like I'm likable in general. Like, whoever it's up to, like, that's okay, but it's just, I'm not- You're almost impossible to unlikable, but there are those people you can't please no matter what, so we just throw them out. I just feel like I'm navigating, so I say this. I'm navigating this, the business side, and I'm trying not to delineate it too much. Oh, it's business.
00:26:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I have to.
00:26:51 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Because I asked her, like, ah, because Mark said that's, that's my advantage because I'm a woman. I can ask those things.
00:27:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Neither like for business stuff, but well, think about it this way though. No women, I think we all have mother hearts. Maybe there's a few exceptions, but I think of women as the moms. It doesn't matter if we birth children or not, we nurture, we do it everywhere we go. So, but we are stewards and we're, you're just, so think of it as your business also as like your house, your family, your rules. If somebody comes into your house, you lay down the ground rules, like this is what it's like. And you choose, you know, if you go into somebody else's house, same kind of thing, you respect their rules, but you also have your family standards. the point of the rules and the point of the values is this is what we think will take care of our children, our family, our stewardship best. And so, you know, we let's say you're having somebody who's babysitting or coming in to clean for you like you're coming into my family this is my expectations of you and so when you think about taking care of business think of it in terms of that like i'm just negotiating the best outcome for those people and those things that i take stewardship over now if you don't get paid you don't have the resources that you need even if so let's say that energy is part of the resources right because it is so for me to have maximum energy i need to be making way more than the average person i because i i'm going to be hiring help um my experiences my travel things like that those things energize me but when i take that energy back to my stewardship back to what i'm managing my mood and my energy is contagious so if i'm low energy everyone around me and they're like what is wrong with you and they can't even focus on it because they're like, I'm so used to you being bubbly and a battery pack, basically, people literally just take energy from me and not from me, but grow it from me. So anyway, these, these, these are all kind of currencies that we exchange. And again, there's that negative voice and I had to try to tell us certain things that we do are wrong, or they're not altruistic or they're not good or whatever. But the truth is, in order to manage your stewardship, well, you have to make sure that everything's optimized, including your mood and your energy. We already know that if you're thinking you're not getting compensated enough, you're checking out because you don't think it's worth it. So there's nothing wrong about that. If you don't have the energy to show up as your most amazing self, you're not going to be able to be there to bless those people in a way that the average and they see is not going to do. So just see each person that you're negotiating with, especially if it's another woman like, hey, we're the ones taking care of everybody, what do you need a care of your family that I can give to you, right? And that includes the payment negotiations because their family is business oriented as well. And here's what me and my family need, right? stewardship. And so if you think about those financial conversations as just another part of the, you know, family exchanges, like what we need to take care of then you can remove that stigma about, you know, whether it's kind of dirty or not right or whatever, like there's just these things about about adding the financial element to it. And just know that that's what enables you to be able to show up at your, at your fullest and as your best self, to give all these gifts, to show up for that man that you showed up yesterday, that you would have done, even if you hadn't. got paid, but because you get paid well and because you manage things well, you have more in your tank to give to him, even with all the things going on for you right now.
00:31:10 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, yeah, I just have to really, it's a way we thinking, and it's a perfect example, not today, because one, like I said, that case manager, when I asked if he likes spa. And then second, actually my friend who I become friends with through Mark, because her husband is a chiropractor and she kind of just her husband. So anyways, now we're going to be in a different, not different, but in addition, I guess, to our friendship, Mark asked him then if they can send cases to me now, because I'm in Pete, a management, and she just called me. So he just told me she has a case for me. I told her, But I'm just being honest, like it feels weird as talking business because her demeanor changed too when we're talking, but we were friends begin with it. then now we have to like be on this level. It's really interesting how how that and I'm just hoping that this will not affect.
00:32:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to give you a perspective because it it may be, but like my fiance and I both have this habit in his daughter called it his business voice. So he's very just kind of like gentle giant. I love his deep voice and it's just calm and soothing. But when he talks business, anything that is any kind of leadership or like something he's passionate about his volume like triples. And the intensity and the energy completely shifts and I'm like, like he is in a different mode. completely and I'm probably the same way because like I have a down here kind of thing but it's not necessarily business. It's anything I'm passionate about. I'm in Sunday school, I'm like raising my hand. I'm a nerd. But I was the same way in biology class, on the same way in business, on the same way about sports but I definitely have modes of like this is just kind of chill and hanging out with my friends and then there's although even when I hang out with my friends when I go crazy. So I guess I'm pretty much crazy all the time.
00:33:35 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Never mind. That's bad. Yeah, no, it's just and we more talk about it. And the thing is we haven't seen each other since April. We've just been busy and and I was since I started this in September. I haven't seen hers and now we're doing this. But you know, it's just something that I guess I just have to navigate. you know and be okay with it and not weird about it and be open.

Wouldn't you rather do business with friends?
00:34:08 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Yeah I mean I don't know again this is the first time I'm doing it. Mark has done his still do business with his friends and he I don't know if again because it's new but I you know we have there's like not a saying but you hear people it's not good to do business with your family your friends so maybe that's why I have that negative kind of connotation about it.
00:34:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a lot about that but I'll tell you having been in the business world for a long time there's a you know don't mix business with pleasure whatever you have to ask yourself who is the they that say these what are their values um but in in small communities everybody's doing business with each other they're all related so you know. there has to be a place where that's not true and that means there has to be people in value. So if you think about it, what kind of person would say that? That would be somebody who wants to take advantage of other people and not about about it. That's who would say that. Or that's the kind of person who isn't willing to have a difficult conversation with somebody else who's crossing the line and needs to be managed. Some people will want to take advantage of friends and family and things like that. But that's true in all of life. So the solution for a leader isn't to avoid that. It's to be conscious of it and make wise choices with who you do business with and make sure that everybody that you do business with is qualified for the level of access that you give them. But you should be doing that in all areas of life. When we share details of our lives, we should only share it with people who are safe with that level of access. When we show details of our business, we should only share it with people who are safe with that level of access. And so just because somebody's a friend doesn't mean that they should not be somebody that you do business with, but you should ask yourself, are they qualified? Can they handle this type of conversation? Can they, and one of my favorite kind of litmus tests is, are they a consistent person across the board? they show up the same everywhere they go? Like, I am as either nice, obnoxious, feisty, whatever you want to call it, everywhere I go. Doesn't matter if I'm at church, doesn't matter. I sometimes will say bad words and sometimes they're places I'll never say bad words. But the type of language, the values, the energy I have shows up across the board the same. So anybody can do something with me and I'm going to show up the same. So when you evaluate people and you with your psychology background will be good at this and you probably were naturally, probably why you gravitated towards it, just reading people. But if you can tell, there's something behind somebody and they're not sharing it, then I proceed with caution, whether they're it's a professional or a friend relationship. Yeah. one of the other things, Shona, I will leave you, well, we're not, we're not ending this, but I really would love to share with you as a woman. And something that I've noticed is that it's not just as a woman, it's just period, that the kind of worldly perspective, whatever it is, the general rule of thumb, I almost always can throw it out because I am an exception to most of the rules. And the reason is, is because I'll tolerate more pain than most people will. I'll, I'm willing to be more truthful than most people will. I'm willing to, and those two things go hand in hand, because sometimes the truth is really, painful and I can sit with it. But I wasn't always like that. I had to learn that and I had to choose that and the reason I chose it is because not telling the truth could cause more pain than telling it. Whether it's just telling somebody I don't like a particular thing or I don't want to be somewhere and then making an excuse for it instead of just saying, yeah, I'm not really interested in that and just letting those burdens go. But most people will mask and they'll put on kind of a show. those are the people that are making the rules and the adages that we live by. so you have to ask yourself, do you want to follow the rules of the people who are not really happy, who are not really living authentically, who are not really living in alignment with the values that they have or who don't are value less, right? Or do you want to live according to your value? and according to the dictates of your unconscious. if that's the case, you're probably going to zig when everybody else is zagging. You're probably going to do something different anyway. And so trust your conscious, trust if you're a praying person and you talk to God about things, trust what you get, trust when you feel peaceful about it, and be willing to be brave and learn from experience. So one of the other things that I've learned a lot is being willing to be wrong, but get the answer for myself. So, so-and-so says this, I feel this, I actually don't know. The only way I'm going to know is to try something. So I'm going to try my way, and if I'm wrong, I'm going to deal with the lesson of being wrong. But then I'll know, and I can take that knowledge and apply it to everything else moving forward, rather than trying to find this zig spot in between and avoid any kind of pain, which is what most people try to do. I'd rather get to the painful part and have the certainty, then try to avoid it.
00:40:06 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. That's how we learn.
00:40:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I think that that's what you're doing. I think every type of growth that you've had so far has been, I'm just going to deal with the pain and I'm gonna make this decision. I'm gonna see how it feels.
00:40:21 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
And then you come out like, yeah, that was awesome. Yeah. So far, it's, you know, so far, it's challenging with the balancing. And to be honest, like, I'm trying, I know me as a person, I get easily there with what happened to me back to Rachaeli. It's very, I can, like, yesterday, yesterday, Sunday, I was, I'm not working. So, but yesterday, I was my work day. I was definitely derailed on that one, but I make sure that I get up today and do what I need to do.
00:41:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It doesn't seem direct to me at all.
00:41:19 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, I mean, to be honest, I started the process on the Washington and even that I have yet to finish that. Like, have to go to two universities and to be honest, I haven't.
00:41:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So this is the thing. This is why we will talk about pacing lots of times. There is there is a divine kind of pace that is so much bigger than us that's happening all the time. I have this conversation frequently and because I have strong energy and I'm powerful and I can make things happen. have, you know, there's obstacles or whatever, I've tried had to power through and push through, and every single time it has backfired. So sometimes it's just I needed to grow and I wasn't what I needed to be. And God just kind of like, just, I'm going to give you these obstacles. chill out because I'm trying to teach you some things and some of those things are just subconscious. Some of them are experiences. Sometimes it's because God is doing work with the people that I'm going to be doing business with, and he needs them to be changed for me so that when we already the work together, everything is aligned. And I only know this because through long conversations, we're like, wait a minute, if this had happened sooner, we wouldn't have been ready because of this, because of that, because of this. And so there are things that are happening that are outside of my control. You got in a car accident outside of your control. There are different things and we can look at that and clearly say I had no control over that. It happened. Then I will go, okay, well, maybe, you know, I'll keep doing the things that I'm control of but I'm not going to try to compensate for the things that are happening outside of my control and just allow that slow down or throttling to happen and continue being consistent showing up at the pace that I'm doing. Now in terms of like keeping on top of charting to me that's the showing up consistently and sometimes you have to compensate for that but when in terms of like marketing right the growth oriented so there's maintenance level work sometimes you have to you know compensate for the person to keep up with the maintenance but the growth type stuff sometimes that just needs to be throttled and paced back because all of these other things come in and so when that happens instead of like feeling bad about it or like I should have done this it's not going to grow as fast we understand that whatever it's going to be it's already It's kind of predetermined. You basically show up to do the thing, right? There's something bigger than you because it's not just you. It's all these other people involved, right? And they're all belong to God too. They're all his children too. And so he's kind of helping us. And all we have to do is show up. So as long as you're still showing up and you're doing the work and you're pondering it, and if you feel like, okay, I should be doing this because you've got the energy, the motivation, you can do it versus the guilt, right? Because God doesn't use guilt, Satan uses guilt. We got to think about this. God gives us good feelings. So just kind of like check that and just be like, you know what? It's the holidays. I have done all of this work, which is one of the reasons why I think pointing out the winds is really big. Right. We can't have all the winds all the time. We'd be burning out. Like if that was happening, you'd be burning out. So if you can look at yourself and look at every day and go, I'm, I did good. This was good. enough and just let that be enough and then just keep keep working on inserting the growth on top of the maintenance because if you try to go faster than that you will burn out but also there will be other things that won't be ready for you to get there because we're all kind of working together even if we're not aware of it there's synergy that would exist for a reason it's that there are these ethereal kind of tethers to other people and other things in life that we can't even we can't even wrap our heads around and we can't touch and we can't see but we can tell there's something happening that's why we have that word is this this alignment that can't be explained otherwise so just you know take all of that into account measure how amazing your growth has been how much you haven't allowed things to derail you how when you made a choice to like keep up with charts
00:46:00 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
other amazing things happened and I think we need to get in a habit of just started like writing it down like maybe I just have a document of like all the wins that you report to me so we can go back and go and this is what happened in the last 90 days of just like that's amazing yeah yeah because it really has been amazing Jonah right I mean it's it's I feel like it is definitely that right and you saw me as like feeling defeated and then oh there's that money component but then I'm trying to again look at the bigger picture not everyone will you know other things not not everyone will have this kind of like partnership that died for me with Dr. E and obviously paved that way for me and which what you can only do is you can just do But at the end of the day, will still be up to me to take this work, which I'm very grateful for. And I think he can also see that we're ready. And I'm getting a little nervous with James because I don't know how busy we will be and the holidays and everything. But I just have to, it is what it is and this is what we wanted.
00:47:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Actually, that right there is probably a very good reason why you don't want to be pushing for Washington stuff. You already got one type of growth that's about to hit you.
00:47:40 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
I would just brace yourself for that and not think about anything else. Yeah, especially today too, like when I met Havas, and I was kind of engaging how big they are, how busy they are. I was talking to the case managers, how many attorneys tell we have 18? Oh, yeah, that's a lot. I know Mark has, I don't know. Samantha, Lorenz, Tyler, Hank, Patrick, Patrick, Patrick, cutest if I had a boy like he'd be about Patrick's is like, mean, just the door, then, um, well, Michelle, who is a, it hurt his chief financial officer, but also a lawyer, but none taking a lot of this is 18, and so I guess, and I know Mark refer cases to him, I guess the cases that they don't like, so they handle volume. Yeah, what I understand. So, and then it's a blessing because I'm supposed to meet Mike, which is the brother of the lawyer, the main lawyer, and then he passed by and I was introduced and he said, okay, we'll start meeting. I kind of like, try to throw it out there very quickly. Like we have four officers, so I'm learning on how to just be very quick, say what's the most important things to say for in a short amount of time. So that is what we came to management. So we have four officers that's really, okay, we'll start feeding you cases. That's what he says. Like, we have that. That is amazing. That is a good, really good meeting, I think, and relationship with Tyler, which is the right hand case manager. Tyler is apparently like Mark's Mary.
00:49:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But Tyler's a woman?
00:49:37 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Tyler's a woman, I know.
00:49:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've never heard of a female Tyler.
00:49:41 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, and she's tall. Like you're tall. She's like 5'7", she's like, oh yeah, he's very lovely. So we connected very How tall are you, Tona, that you think 5'7's tall?
00:49:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, we're just saying.
00:49:54 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Well, I'm 5'2 and 6'4".
00:49:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's tall.
00:50:00 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Oh yeah, she's 6'4 and her mom is 5'2 and that's why she's, I think she's 5'7, 5'8, he's tall and you know, I like, I really like her so we connected there and I feel very good about her. So tomorrow I'm going to meet Steve and yeah, the person that I'm going to all men tomorrow, I'm the only woman to all. Well, that's what Mark said. Mark said there's Steve, the main partner and there's two people that run place and I told Dr. E, you better be here and you better not be late. But anyway, she will be there and I'm, you know, I think it's, oh, it's at that level that Dr. E needs to be there because he owns a practice.
00:50:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My daughters just got home, moms are going nuts. Bob, can you? Aphrodite out, please Is that the new not the new dog, right?
00:51:05 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
No next week.
00:51:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We don't even speak. I also unpacked ours Okay, so I mean so we're like halfway through December and we've got really just kind of Science and patience especially So what I want you to do is I want you to focus on your health and your energy I want you to focus just on having a consistent schedule and keeping on top of your charting and Celebrating the wins with me whatever they are and and just if you don't have a window report just maybe something you contemplated that day so that we're staying connected and just kind of in the zone and Don't let mark be pushy Letting me anything don't don't let the the kind of like go go go energy and he's like that Take this time tell him look you need to go talk to Tina Just tell him and you can text us in a three way and I'll get on it for you But like take a couple of weeks to just kind of rest because you've been in a sprint mode While yeah, I think that's why I got sick Yes, and so take this time On cue take this time to read be really intentional about rejuvenating and Resting physically and emotionally and just contemplating because there's a lot of power in that Contemplation in that awareness of where you've come from and what you're preparing for because you're going to get into another sprint mode And it will be exhausting it will be difficult and it will be stressful for a while And then it will kind of balance out and you'll be okay If you don't do a good job about disconnecting and giving yourself some space mentally, physically, emotionally, right now, that's going to be a lot harder. You could get more sick, which is going to throttle you. It's going to frustrate you. But it's also going to keep you from showing up for your patients the way that you want to. And they need you.
00:53:20 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
know, you, I didn't tell you that they are setting aside PI cases on Thursday afternoon. That's for me. Wow. So that is from Dr. E. I mean, they didn't ask me first before they do this. Although, I think they kind of see the pattern that I'm scheduling PI cases on a Thursday. So they probably thought, I like Thursday, which is fine. But I said, here it is. It's coming in terms of lean cases only on Thursday afternoon. So when It gets bigger. It's going to be I I'm going to say Wednesday, Thursday.
00:54:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, go ahead. I also want you to really just be looking at your calendar and being really intentional and paying attention. Like, do you want to put caps on things? you want to make sure that sometimes or certain like blocked off? don't fill this out. Make sure that you are driving what's coming.
00:54:31 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Okay. I didn't tell me that Thursday, but then I realized it actually works out.
00:54:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And also trust yourself to be able to do the hard things because you, you know, three weeks ago, this was like, I don't know if I want to do this anymore. And no, but that's not a judgment. That's not a bad thing. It was just you have to make a choice. But my point is that the power to shift.
00:55:00 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
stop was completely inside of you and it will remain that way but it was you driving what's happening and you owning what's happening that changed everything so don't stop doing that yeah you know i'm yeah and i'm ready i know i already said to myself oh did i tell you i don't know we friday with my friends i we kind of like i think i may have started like let's go around the table what's our goals what the plans are for next year not just look these are my luxury friends so they're you know they're very bougie but you know we talk about but they're like they have careers and businesses so we talk about that and i may have said out loud i don't i don't know it's a and they're like okay I see the like she's kind of crazy type of love but like I said it out loud that's what I said for myself and it's what I'm going to get so yeah yeah I didn't even realize I will do that but yeah here we are there we are so so you have got to manage your energy yes so you need to take these you tell mark if you like you gotta blah blah look have us James they're coming I'm gonna rest so that I can kill it and you're not gonna bug me about it sure yeah I know he introduced me I have small ones chiropractors and other lawyers but again mark said like mark said nothing not everything will work out into James we just don't know But, you know, so far I have a good feedback from Haber's Law because when she told me like, I saw her notes, you know, it's good and you're on top of the patient's, the patient like you, you know, it's like, so it's a good feedback that's just consistency.
00:57:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
just need to keep on. Yeah, because Chona, most of the things I win in life, I win just because I show up. Because very few people just show up consistently. And so I'm telling you that because I want you to understand how powerful that is, how impressive it is. All the other doctors, not all of them, most of them, do not show up consistently. The people they hire don't show up consistently. Very few people get a consistent experience with the people that they work with. So two things about that. one, know that you're incredibly valuable just because of that. number two, when you eat those kinds of people in business, keep them because they're incredibly valuable and rare as well. Consistency is a powerful signal and a delineator really between just about everybody else and these, you know, exceptional people in life.
00:58:23 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
All right, let's go.
00:58:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I was just going to do, let's go. Look at this, because I know Mark is planning on keeping his calls with me.
00:58:42 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
When are you available? Monday, you mean next week? Yeah. Oh yeah, I'm available too.
00:58:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I'm keeping, I'm pretty much keeping my same schedule, so that means I don't have like new openings. So can you do Wednesday?
00:59:00 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
next week still? Yeah, I, we are time. What time are you thinking?
00:59:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I thought this was a standing.

Hey, hey, long time no see I know it feels like I don't like it.
00:00:08 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's been a month or so. Yeah, I didn't know if we were meeting today or that was like a legit invite. I guess you get it set up now for monthly calls.

I would recommend saying, hey, you know, that that last promo basically paid for me for the next nine months, so what do you say? Keep working together and here's what we do and that there's no way, you know, that you're not going to keep making more money for what I'm doing, so I'm thinking it's a no brainer and and I'm telling you because I just did that with one of my attorneys. So last year, I talked to, so I have an attorney that has another office and he's got like, sits attorney.
00:03:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
journeys that work for him.
00:03:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Last year, I talked to two of them. One of them was his top performer and one of them was his bottom performer. And the top performer was like, I don't need you, I'm good. Which was okay, because she's the top performer. the other one was like, yeah, I've got all these goals, I could do this, I could do that. And I gave them a couple of books. I, you know, after listening to him, I'm why don't you just work on this one thing? And he did, and he doubled his attorney fees. So he went from a million dollars to two million dollars attorney fees. And so this last week, I was talking to him, because he was talking about wanting to do some work. I'm like, well, I mean, the results paid for itself last year. You could be in pay me every month and you'd still be in profit from hiring. So that's a brainer.
00:03:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You guys. Oh, yeah, you're right.
00:03:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, well, just don't think about what the return is. And so just pointing it out in simple math, like right in front, like, you know, when we do the numbers exercise, the numbers just make it a no-brainer. like, oh, duh, I mean, already ROI form the initial investment plus eight more months, you know. So it's just, if you want the job, that's the no-brainer offer.
00:04:27 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right, right. Yeah, that's a good point. I'll, yeah, I'm thinking after the fourth is when I'll put any mail together, but that's, you know, and I'll definitely point out, like, you know, we brought it, we did 45k to own our first promotion. And what are the profit sharing, like, profit partner kind of arrangement? Yeah, I mean, I think that that can be in the future. I mean, honestly, like, right now, I mean, I kind of, I kind of like getting the 5K every month and, and that, that feels like it's serving more what I need right at the moment.
00:05:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, just guaranteed it's there.
00:05:17 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, yeah, but it's also giving me just like, I mean, the competences, I'll just say it. I feel like there's a better word, it's giving me Or it's holding my eyes to like, you know, I can, like, I can go and if this falls through with Tim, like, I'll, I'll go to somebody else and I can handle, you know, writing their copy of their emails. I think one of the things I've learned working with Tim is like, because. He's got a very specific strategy that he's wanted to do, that he is doing in a space with group, and we're following this client and community guys for Stapleton, and he's got a partner for his name, but you know, it's like I'm writing, I guess this is the first time that I'm really executing on what the actual work to be like a lightweight influencer of sorts, and I say lightweight because it's only like one post a day where I think of like a TikTok influencer or putting out a bunch of short form content, so it's a different type, but it's a different type of content, and it's, I was thinking about this, like I think It really is the first time that I've done this kind of thinking and work of like creating social media content, tying it to a promotion that I know is coming to three weeks from now and thinking about like seeding these little agreements in my posts. And that and that's that part is cool. But I where I'm going with that is like I kind of that like that's fun to think about for somebody else and do it for them. It is not the thing that I would want to do for me as a guest. So yeah, there are two things I want to talk to you about right there.
00:07:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So first of all, you're doing one of my favorite strategies, one of my favorite levers, which is getting paid to learn and to sharpen yourself off. So this is a really, really viable skill, even if you don't want to do it. or so doing it for other people, it's important to know the logistics of how it works and why it works. I'm the same way I don't want to do any of the stuff for myself. What I can do for everybody else, I almost always cannot do for myself. I can do a little bit of it. But I think about doing it for myself and like new, not going to happen. Just I can, I won't. Part of that by the way is in alignment with 80 and negative dysfunction. And that can be a really normal thing for most entrepreneurs.
00:08:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It tends to be for like all of my clients.
00:08:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can always treat everybody else differently. So there's that. But if you have enough clients of your own, we're not doing a lot of work, we can hire somebody that can do this for you. That will extract from you what they need to do. That's very good at doing this. But because you already have the skill and knowledge, when they're driving, you can go actually, why don't we tweet this and that? So it goes to the same kind of thing that you like to do when it comes to copy, which is copy cheating, not the junior copywriting, right, you don't want to start from scratch. So if you have enough funds where you can hire somebody for maybe $1,000 a month. And obviously, you'd need to be where you're really comfortable and you've got that. So the goal would be maybe another Tim or two, if it doesn't take a lot. Because that's an extra $10,000, which you could even use for a junior copywriter, you know, a little bit of it. So, so that you're not adding too much work. But that could be really leveraged. And so now you can hire somebody to work in your own business, who's very skilled, but you don't need a lot of time to build out a social media campaign. So it's not like they got to work 40, 20 hours, you know, maybe 10 hours.
00:09:48 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
But it isn't about the hours, it's about the results.
00:09:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if they're really good at what they do, you know, if you're just paying like, it's a flat rate, here's the job. Do you agree to accomplishing this job? for this amount of money and you know so it's you know per the project or whatever you can do that and there's a lot of people with that skill now you know now versus three years ago four years ago 10 years ago like it's so much different yeah um so but you being sharp on this and the extra money coming in um the tea money I feel like is for sure going to come in don't know what the titans numbers look like but you guys have been pretty steady you've learned about what the bootcamp does you're doing the podcast app you didn't leave any notes about that so I'd love to know about that but it feels like you're leveraging and you're building this um financial kind of moat and hedge that could support you having a small surgical strike team for yourself yeah um I have thought about just needing just getting one other person like a copywriter
00:11:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
down the road if because I'm thinking like I could do that I could get another time like I could manage that and I would bring on somebody to help with that and but I don't feel ready to take that step and go out and pursue that just yet but it's on my mind and I've got a few people in mind that I would reach out to that I feel like I could get a it wouldn't be hard to get a yes from them and they would well I guess I don't know if they would pay five grand but I was like that that's gonna be my my minimum that's gonna be my to do what I do and cuz like it Like I put my whole My brain into this and like I consume all their go through all their courses and you know the to just learn the product and I just feel like the level of service that I Bringing in the the copy that I fruit not just a copy of just like thinking through like I put the whole promotion or the bonuses and like all this Like the whole package like it's Yeah, I just realized like that that's what I am gonna do. That's what I'm gonna want to do because I feel like that's gonna Give us the best chance of succeeding and so for that You know, I'm grand Which I think is an insane deal and bargain Which is why I was talking about when I was talking about the profit sharing and I was talking about a flat rate of five grand plus
00:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you know a percentage of like a very tiny percentage like maybe even one percent of the net profits from the promo.
00:13:09 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Like not a business just from the promo like a performance bonus. Yeah, that could be a possibility. And they're great guys. It's 10 and I don't know if they're super great and laid back. And they're very hands off. know, this is awesome. They don't get in my way.
00:13:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean you've earned that too with who you are. You have a reputation, you're in an environment where you are positioned as an authority and so but there are people you know that they do know how to do that research and spend that time studying everything I think a lot of the female copywriters are probably more in line to do that and not charge a whole lot but there's also a lot of copywriters who just aren't they're not marketers for themselves so they can sell everybody else's stuff but themselves so they don't charge the highest rates they don't ask super high fees and but they just want consistent work and they want to work with good people that don't abuse them these copywriters who get abused a lot like they're responsible for all the sales even if there's crappy product bad people who don't know how to manage their business give good information, um, they're lying about what they're trying to sell, like all kinds of things, right? But it's a copywriter's job to make everything work. That and the media buyers, like that's it, some of the most ridiculous kind of expectations that are put on those type of people. But for you, like, if you had, let's say, two more clients and then you wouldn't want to do them back to back go in for yourself and really know their stuff inside out. Um, you know, like, I don't like to stack on new clients all at once because I, I, I dream about everything. Like, that's how much it's in my head because I don't know things yet. And my brain can't stop thinking about it because I have all these questions until I have a really good view of things or a good enough view. literally can't rest mentally. because I'm still trying to work it out and process it. And so, you're going and you're learning all these things. And I know your brain is always going. You're always thinking about stuff. So you had to kind of keep that in mind. But if you set the intention of trying to find somebody that you can work with that chart is a lot less than you do, that can do some different stuff, like maybe you give them an assignment of going through all these sales pages, all these email sequences and coming back and giving me a report. What this is, give me a few samples. instead of digging into all the different sources, you can just look at this. Maybe it's a document with a snapshot of here's a here's a literal picture of some of the copy from the website, some of the copy from the thank you page, some of the copy from the email sub all in one thing. So that's saving you time from click, click, click, click, click, right? But also what you know is that they've actually been into it, they've actually looked at it, and they've given you a report back and said, okay, here's what I see, right, this is a weak spot that they have, right, they're really not highlighting their USP, they really don't have a good hook, but here's a hook I did find, here's, you know what I mean, there's a process, and if you're looking at doing this for another 10, 20 years, 30, whatever, like I would imagine that long, I would like to see you make enough money where you can just start investing at your money's working for you. But you're going to be doing this for a long time anyway, so you really should be sending an intention of, I've got a solid junior copywriter or two that I'm working with who are, you know, really happy to be working with me because I'm a good guy and I'm not going to get them bad clients, I'm going to give them, you know, as consistent work as possible, but they're still contractors, which means you're not their financial protector. looks like maybe is it a male or female is it there's a lot of childless women in the copy world I don't know you know but there are and they also do not charge the same kind of rates as their male counterparts they're very loyal they're incredibly smart and and they love working for really great people you're the type of person that would that they would love working with and working for so that's something that you can kind of just tuck in your cap and know um kind of set a magnet out you know looking for that because you've come across them throughout the talking you've mentioned this person that person whatever and I'm like that's very interesting to me because I've been noticing it more and more so anyway those are just some things to think about because you're right on that press this. It's going to be one day you're like, okay, it's time to pull the trigger. And that's very soon. Especially with the results you got with that promo.
00:20:09 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I know, I know. well, I just turned out, yeah, yesterday, today's Wednesday, Monday, that there were three more new call appointments that came in last week for this week. they're using for the offer that I wrote. And they're using on their sales calls, the offer, the whole promo that I put together. Because before it was just here's an eight week course. We do weekly calls. And I turned it into this. Well, not an intern. Communicated what it actually was is not like I created something. It's just like they got so much more than just like an eight-week Course and yeah, but they would just we're doing a disservice and Leaving money on the table talking about it. Yeah, and now I'm working on this new promo, which is really cool It's all about how to turn switch your gym to is what's called a semi semi-private model and So it's like a hybrid of one-on-one and small group, but it's a four to six People in a class, but each one's got it their own individual customized workout and Like that's the model that Tim runs in his gym and they just you charge like a hundred bucks a week um for this kind of special specialized attention and community and You know at that at that rate like just to get to half a million in a year, you need less than 100 members doing a semi-private model and so it's, mean, can probably tell it's interesting to me because I'm into fitness, I don't really want to start a gym or anything, but it's interesting getting to know this market. And like just understand their financial issues and then now helping them make this switch to doing a semi-private model and seeing like how lucrative that can be for somebody who really is passionate about you coaching somebody and their fitness journey.
00:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, go ahead, keep on.
00:23:02 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
But like I was working on this promo today, I just went through all the training material, and that's the initial hook or headline that I'm working around. I'm going to write tomorrow morning around this idea, but it's something around how to build a $500,000 a year business with less than a hundred members, a $500,000 a year gym business with less than a hundred members. Something in that ballpark is where I'm thinking that that will be the hook, and then the sales letter describes how that happens.
00:23:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you happen to know the attrition rate?
00:23:48 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Not off the top of my head, but oh, for semi-private, it's not as high as tradition. like control access.
00:24:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow, so that's a hook right there. Yeah, that's a that's a massive hook right there because I would think it would be higher because of the amount of money. No, that means if I'm a business owner and I read that, I'm like, yeah, but like, how many people do I actually have to, how many times do I have to fill in that hundred, you know, like, and not everybody because I don't think everybody thinks about attrition, but I do. So, but anyway, but again, we'll have the numbers tell the story for you. Right, because it's a really powerful thing to say you only have to get 100 yeses, right, 100 people to say yes to this offer. don't need to get, you know, 500 or 1000 people like it's 100. And if the attrition rate, let's say it's 40%, you know, 140 people to say yes, that still sounds very doable. You break that up across, you know, the months or whatever, like just if you show them how easy it is, if you're providing this offer, this service, and also if you could show them, you know, where does it work? Does it only work in metro areas? Does it work in rural areas? Does it work in certain areas that have a medium income of X or whatever? Like if you were to do some data like that and do some case studies, put that on the website, which of course that takes time to build and to to see because it's a newer type of offer. But that's something that you can be working on with Tim and say, look, these are all the things that like basically build yourself a job for the next year. Like this is what we're building, this is what we're working on. We have to be getting these case studies. We're going to continue to get this data, but the data is going to continue to change as more people are doing it. going to get more information. But either way, like it's already paying for itself over and over again. And so get on board.
00:26:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Let's do this stuff.
00:26:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And yeah, but you could also be in terms of like you always want to be giving back to people. You be changing the fitness industry where people actually might be showing up more consistently because they're actually getting one on one health customized health. It's semi-private. So, you know, they're not paying as much as they would. So it's a little like, but that's not the word restrictive. And, you know, it could be making something really great, more available to more people than it was, but also allowing the trainers and the gym members because they're working with more people consistently because you're helping them stay full, be able to sharpen their saws and get better at what they do. So, like, just a little criss over here with a copywriting $5,000 a month. But I was just like taking over making a huge difference in the world. to me, that's the kind of stuff I love about what I do in my business. And maybe nobody else is acknowledging the impact that you're making. But if you look at it, that's a huge impact.
00:27:16 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Totally. And I mean, really, the comparison, guess, the Apple, it'd be more Apple's to comparison my private to one-on-one personal training.
00:27:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah.
00:27:30 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know, as I was thinking about it. Definitely. But there are, like I knew once that like orange theory, their average, do you know orange theory? No. that would be considered a large group model so that you go from station to station. Okay. So everybody's doing the same workout. You can have up to 30 people. know.
00:27:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like circuitry.
00:28:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I mean, but that's right now. Yeah, exactly. Okay. Um, so that'd be a large group model. And you can, you know, that you can make more than just doing like a general admission gym doing by having these larger groups. But like orange theory, they're, uh, uh, what's the word I'm looking for? The people leave on average after three or four months, their memberships last so long. usually it's not that, not that long. Um, but what ends up happening with, uh, semi-private is there's a, there's there's a onboarding, like there's a way that Tim sells it because I've gone through his training and, um, he, he kicks off the semi-private by bringing, he has a, an event because of the state of the union. as Jim, and he just brings in members and holds this two-hour event, and he just lets know where the fitness industry is going, then he introduces, he's got this whole script of how you introduce semi-private and compare it to one-on-one, but it's not as expensive as one-on-one, and then he's got two different ways he does contracts with people when they come in, so it's like, he's got a really solid team. I forget where I was going with that, but I do want to talk a little bit about Titans, switching gears, like Brian, he's been laying a little low. We've got the Over-Deliver Bootcamp coming up next month, and I'm I had a call with him. Oh, it his past Monday we met and he's having a procedure done on his on his heart. He shared with me a small, like outpatient, he said, but he's been having not, he said, I'm not going into a fib, which he was doing that like all the time before his last surgery, but he would he call it. Not palpitations or rhythmia, maybe.
00:30:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what it was, I think.
00:30:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
you know, he's, he's, and he was apologetic. He's like, I know, I've been, he owes me things and I figured something was going on because he's, he's usually faster to respond. you've watched him withdraw and then seen why he withdraws. Mm hmm. Um, and I brought up, I said, we haven't talked about this event in a while, and last time we spoke like we were doing it in January, and he was like, ah, don't know. He started doing this thing that he does. And, um, he, you know, he's using, this is going to sound more, I don't know, know, to come across this way, but he's using his health as an excuse to not really think about the, the event and, and plan that. So, whether that's, you can say it's legit, like, all right, if you need to do that, then that's totally fine. And I'll just, I'll just accept that, like, that's It's what he needs to do, because I'm not going to tell him, you know, uh, the alternative, I guess, but, but it just got me thinking because then he was like, you know, I don't know, like January of 2026, we could do this event, but I was just like, you know, it since Monday, I just, I've always, um, I've always just felt like I'm on this little bit of a roller coaster. With Brian in terms of like how he wants to show up, and, you know, get, and he even told me, he's like, you know, I'm like two or three times your age, and, and I'm like, you know, there's going to be probably in the near future where he just wants to not do this anymore.
00:32:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so that's where I'm pretty new. Like he's been sun setting for a while.
00:32:52 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:32:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Sorry, I didn't want to cut you off like I just, but that's, that is the thing. that we've been watching and there is, you know, there are kind of, at the very least right now, two things to look at. You have great respect and reverence for Brian and appreciation for him and overall this is his business. However, you have been deeply invested in it, you have nurtured it, you have been the primary reason for not only its growth, but its maintenance for probably the last four years or so. Whenever he had a stroke, I feel like it was around 2020, that wasn't it? It was around there, yeah. And you have not only been invigorating to his business, but you have been invigorating to his life. And it's not even about feeling entitled to any particular thing. even though you've earned stuff, it's that the writing is on the wall that Brian's pace is probably permanently changed. ability, like his fire is flickering. It's not extinguished. It bursts up a little bit. It goes down a little bit based on health, life circumstances, but it has definitely altered significantly, and I would be shocked if it's not permanently. I know he's a peptide, I do believe that there are miraculous things that can happen. I don't think Brian has the willpower and the drive inside of him to drive to it. He doesn't seem like a hardcore driven person anymore. Like I think that part has flickered out and been replaced by family and life, which is okay. But... I think that that was a priority shift that changed permanently. And if he truly does have everything that he needs set aside financially, that he doesn't have to make more money, then that has to come into it too. And you are just hitting your stride of like, I am a business man. I got skills, I can bring money, I can grow, and all of these other people, there's a market that is begging to be served, quality content, quality service. I'm here to do it, you know, and now you're being throttled. You've been throttled. You've been throttled since I met you with Brian not showing up. And this is with all due respect. It isn't about bad-mouthing him for it.
00:35:53 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I mean, we've had this conversation many times. We don't really need to say it, but I do.
00:35:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's just a real- be difficult situation to be in. So back to, you know, what can you do? I think, at some point, like, I think you really have to keep leaning into building the thing that you build, and pacing stuff out, and letting go of like, don't even try to plan events with Brian, you know, I just, because it will, you deserve to not be frustrated, but also the power of that frustration can be so detrimental to your happiness, to your peace, to your productivity, and all of your happiness and peace impacts how you show up as a dad. And even if it's just a slight diminishing, it's going to be perpetual because this is the pattern that Brian has over and over again, commit to something, doesn't do it for really valid reasons in terms of like, you know, but it, but that, that is what it is. So I would be looking for, how do we nurture Titans, Accelerator, and as with as little dependence upon Brian as possible, what does that model look like, where it's at the very least maintaining its revenue for you and for him, very at the very least maintaining its value and reputation, which I think that you can do like you could probably do all the over delivered book camps by yourself and people still feel good because you're showing up in the Titans world so much and so many of them are so new that and you've been there since day one, that's potentially it. You know, something to think about along that path but really just how do you build it independent of Brian where he can be like, surprise, I'm here. Yeah, everybody. I did not be, but nothing that requires he has to show up. think there's still a lot of financial potential for you, where that's not stressful. Because the other option is, like, can I at leaving, giving an ultimatum of like, this is how it's going to be, or maybe just give me a higher percentage because this is a lot to deal with, and also give me more power over what happened without having to get your approval, because you're bottlenecking and I'm trying to build and grow. And I understand why you're doing it. You've got real needs, but so do I. Like, I'm in business and I might give half at least of my time to this. anyway, that's a lot to think about. It's a lot to process. But maybe that's just something that you can work through because you tend to really Defer to just supporting Brian and just being like it is what it is and not taking care of yourself the way that you ought to and advocating for yourself. And I think that you should advocate for yourself I think that you have more than earned it. And it isn't just advocating for yourself, but the business and the customers that you serve, they need stability and reliability also.
00:39:30 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Well, you know, we're doing rolling out two things inside of TXL that I think is going to help with retention. One is you know about the public podcast, the timeless marketing and that's more about bringing people in, but we were also putting all the calls from TXL into a private podcast. Podcast. that only members can access, and so that's going to make it easier for everybody to be able to access the call recordings right from their phone, like inside the Apple podcast app or Pocketcast or whatever podcast app they use. And the other one is we're starting accountability pods within the group that's led by the members. And so they'll have a set schedule that they meet on. You know, they'll be independent of our two to three calls a month. And so the hope there is that that's going to help foster the community and get people connected. You'll hold people accountable to reaching the goals that they have. Those two things are giving or rolling out the podcast I'll announce, probably before July 4th, pods, I put the initial plan together and sent to Brian and this one of the things he owes me, all in feedback on, but I've been thinking, like don't feel anger or fear, I feel little after that call with Brian, but I've just kind of been thinking like, all right, I want to keep TX all going and I want to keep growing, break through advertising. And in the long term, I still would like to, you know, be a part of break through advertising for forever. you know, whenever the point comes of like Brian passes away, you know, we'll have, whenever Jean's wife Barbara passes away is when we'll because her son will get it. Yeah. Yeah. At that point.
00:42:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How old is she?
00:42:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh, she's like 90 something. Wow. Yeah. She's, she's up there, but, um, yeah, and not rocking the boat, you know, when, when there's that kind of investment and, and I, it's not a just selfish, like I go, wait for him to die and I get this kind of thing.
00:42:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not that it's, I mean, all these relationships are nuanced, um, but that goes back to how do you nurture titans, independent. of Brian where he can just you know show up and less it when he wants to and can but that the stability of it is anchored on the things that you do steadily so that you know it's there you're taking care of he's taking care of and the market is taking care of like I think that you've gotten the ability to do that and I think that just not trying to have big events but I realize that there was a big part of it there's a lot of potential for it there's a lot of connection but but based off of every single year there's been something that has for the last four years at least that has really just been overwhelming for Brian and he's had to pull back for a while so and an event takes months and he he always, for the last few years, has seemed to be, and even before, you know, four years ago, in the beginning, you were like, he wants to get out of the masterminds, like the in-person stuff. So, he's been pulling steadily back out of showing up in person and overcommitting to things for years. That's just not, I can't see that changing. So, to even consider doing something like that and hoping it's going to be able to come to fruition, first of all, could be really detrimental to the brand because people get excited and they want to have it. And then, you know, can only get disappointed so many times before you like tease. Almost, you know, they're hardcore people. and it didn't hurt his brand. Well, you can't say that. But die-hard fans will stay die-hard fans.
00:44:59 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know what I mean? Yep.
00:45:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But that's not all you have in the market. And that's not the only people seeing the stuff that happens. It's also the new people coming in. And so just kind of taking that into account. I think that you can create the thing that just maintained a steady pace where you get to grow and serve the market and just kind of wait for the inevitable, even if it takes years, whether it's Jane's wife or Brian. But I think that compartmentalizing and just kind of putting titans into, putting TXL into like a portion of your day, portion of your week and really focusing on everything else that you're building would be really wise for you.
00:45:52 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Well, and the good thing about that is, you know, like, we do Do you have a small team that really runs?
00:46:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:46:06 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know, and like the social media posts, the podcasting, the, you know, Jamie's handling all the tech stuff. Carlin and Margie are handling the renewals, TXL renewals. You got Jeremy and they're working with you too, right?
00:46:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's that? You got Jeremy Weiss and that makes two.
00:46:30 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, for the podcast. Yeah. And, you know, that's that's humming along and.
00:46:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So big change from this time last year.
00:46:46 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, it's a big change and I feel like. There needs to be a way like to, I mean, I guess maybe it's just. I think that the area of improvement is running a regular promotion for TXL, which we just haven't been doing, and I was thinking about that because I was like, we're going to do this event coming up, and yeah, that is definitely on me getting these promotions running. I think part of it is like it's, it's not painful, but I can't think of the word, it's painful. it. That's That's That's That's That's That's And maybe that's not even what I'm trying to say. I think maybe it's like, we've been, I've put so much effort into putting the team together. I guess now is the point where I can look up and say, right, let's run some promotions. my mind just has not been on running promotions for TXL for whatever reason. And I think what I have in mind is like, we're gonna run these boot camps. Cause I know we're gonna do one next month, we'll do another one in the fall for breakthrough advertising. And that'll be how we bring them up.
00:48:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so the boot camps we know has a super high conversion rate, but they're also more work. It's a whole kind of thing, right, to build. But with the podcast now, you have Evergreen stuff, which is what we're talking about. And I don't know what you have going on, but. Um, there are like, I can think of Jeff Roning as an example with, um, whatever his webinar platform as I can't remember what it is. But, and there's some other people where they, um, are constantly promoting it and then send you to a page and it's like, it's closed. Um, but we'll open eventually, put us in your information and get on a waiting list. And so it feels like there's this scarcity. But really like magically 48, 24 hours later, you get a thing, hey, a spot opened up. Um, so there's that type of thing or there's just, you could just have an evergreen offer. And the scarcity is you don't have any more time to waste doing stupid stuff in your business. You don't have any more time to waste, not having a community support you. You don't have any more time to waste doing less than you could be doing. So, you know, instead of being just signing about it or super highly marked. reading about it, whatever, you just be like, this is the thing, you know, this is an exclusive group. We show up steadily. This is not like, if you're looking for XYZ, you know, high peace, slimy, marketing, get rich quick, selling lotto tickets, selling diet pills, meaning promised results that don't actually work and your odds of winning are next to nothing. Don't come in here, we don't want you. But if you want timeless skills, proven tactics, and you're willing to shock, do the work, wear your people, and you should come in here. And it's, you know, at the end of every episode or in the middle or front, middle end of the episodes, whatever. And then you just promote the podcast all over the place. Instead of promoting accelerator, let the podcast show the intelligence and the smarts and all the other things. and say also do you want to actually talk to us in person here so how many podcasters do you get to talk to in person how many people that you listen to as a mentor do you actually get to work with like this is your chance so it could be a very simple marketing campaign that is actually directed at guests right because they see you out there marketing which means they're going to be promoted higher quality guests better content better service to your people better reasons for them to go I got to get in there yep you know just looking we've got we've got a couple of like ad bumps in the podcast the one at the end we'll take listen to a basically
00:52:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
TXL Quiz, and then that puts them into our, if they're a new subscriber, they get welcome sequence and then promotions for TXL and boot camps. But let's see, that puts this quiz, 37, well 37 finished, but only 17 subscribed at the end, 51 started, 37 finished, 17 subscribers, so far.
00:52:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many people have seen it?
00:52:54 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
51.
00:52:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's a good conversion rate. How many people heard the offer to take the quiz?
00:53:07 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I don't know because that comes at the end of the episode. don't know.
00:53:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you get listening analytics?
00:53:20 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I know.
00:53:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there any way to get that?
00:53:25 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I can email Jeremy with that.
00:53:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to put this podcast in and out. But the conversion rate of how many people actually went there versus how many took it. And then how many subscribed?
00:53:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's pretty good. Yeah. So it's. In in like now we're doing and this is just not even a month old now every Wednesday Brian is mailing the list Sending people directly to the to an episode And I that you know that's all the may see and Apple in the Philippines I don't know if I told you I heard this girl named Apple It was a referral from Macy and she she's done pretty well. I trained I Created a right like Brian GPT. Oh, yeah, and She's been using that and then she sends her drafts to Brian Brian edits and and then they they take it I don't touch it at all It's great I love that Yeah, I'll imagine Yeah, yeah So, yeah, I think with Titans, I don't want to get, I guess, my mind, the question is like, all right, know that this runway will end at some point, but like, there's no reason that we can't just keep this community going for as long as Brian, because I think he kind doing these big events, it's like, you know, just doing a better job of maybe running some ads for the podcast, getting people engaging that way, bringing them in, and just doing it simple, and then adding these stick strategies that improve retention is maybe have a bigger... impact overall. But I, you know, talk about protecting my energy. It was something we've talked about a lot like, I'm feeling internally like how much do I want to put into growing titans beyond what it is already versus, you know, that I'm, I see the difference working with Tim and Tim is very like, he's in it, you know, he's driven and it's, it's just a different feeling being part of something like that. Yeah. And they're, they're just constant activity.
00:56:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
very energizing.
00:56:56 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:56:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not only protecting your energy, but feeding your
00:57:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
energy. Yeah, because he's like, you know, we got a, we got a row in the same direction, because we got goals, he's got this event. And it's like, so I, I, that's crossed my mind of like, all right, how do I, you know, manage this tightens, like, what is that going to be? you could just give it a certain amount of time, and you can set your big rocks and goals and say, okay, here are these things that have to converge.
00:57:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Number one, this is how much time and energy I'm willing to give it period and the story. In that time and energy, these are the most important things that have to get done. When the time is up, times up, I've gotten the most thing that can done, it'll be what it'll be. And sink or swim, whatever. If you, if it ends up that you'll Like it needs more and there's money for you, the higher more, but you don't want to give it more. Great. If it's giving a good return and now you want to give it more, give it more. If it's not working, then maybe it's time to have a new conversation and not worry about what you've lost and consider all the things that has fed you, trained you, molded you, shaped you, be grateful for that. thank you everyone because sometimes that needs to happen. There are seasons and sometimes the seasons end.
00:58:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's interesting they're just looking, yeah, this is 3, 4, 6, 3, 2, it's going to look because we, the other thing that has been interesting to watch is you were selling brick-thru advertising mastery on Amazon. And last week, or last month, we almost came close to being completely out of inventory. We sent 20 books at the end of and we were down to one book at the end of May. So I got 30 more. Let's see how many books we have left. So I sent them 30, and some 30 at the end of May. Alright, so we got 23. So we sold 7. But what I was getting at, so this year, I don't know, you gotta go. Let see how many books we sold total because the whole reason we did Amazon was to see if people would buy it and then opt in. So this year total we've generated 23 leads from Amazon whether these are not leads or buyers, but we sold to find this right report here. Let me see how many books we sold. Oh, here we go, me see. Here we go, go, we we we we we go, here we go, here we go, we go, here Uh, the seller central is, um, sales dashboard.
01:02:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There you go.
01:02:12 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You're not here today. I'll do that.
01:02:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's here today. Yeah, that's the same thing as you're today.
01:02:27 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh, I guess I was thinking it would take me back 12 months.
01:02:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I see.
01:02:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
All right. So let's see what we saw. 50, 50 units. And then all right. we're got about half, half of those buyers who opted in. Okay. Um, so what was that last year this time? We weren't on Amazon this time last year.
01:03:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:03:05 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. And we've got ads running on Amazon and those are, let's see.
01:03:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you able to, like, do you tag those opt-ins and can you tell if any of them have purchased Titans Accelerator?
01:03:21 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, we tag them. Oh, God. It started. Keep is forcing two-factor authentication.
01:03:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Starting today.
01:03:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I hate it.
01:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh Do you want to do any of these tags instead of all? No? Oh, never mind.
01:04:37 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Got you got you got you Yeah, I just want to see Anybody to oh no, that's when oh, okay, Tom pools with a real person so one That's that pays out, you know, yeah, that's not Uh Unprofitable And the ads we'll see here the ads have done well to you on Amazon. Oh, here we go We're just doing like yeah 12 bucks a Measurement before Oh This looks 14 sales, this is over this is this year Yeah, all right guys, this is this year So we spent 1400 and we sold 2100 Yeah, so I mean Amazon's been doing well, you're just like, okay, yeah, I mean, what, that's six, seven hundred dollars, it's how much effort does do you put into it, nothing, it's just kind of set it and forget it. Oh, nothing. Yeah, that's good. I I ship, I get a book shipped to them.
01:06:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many people is that? How many customers? Oh, you said it was like 50.
01:06:37 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, this year is like 50, 51. And I found a, well, didn't find it, but the guy who helped me set up the Amazon seller central here, he, I put him on a project to help me find a cheaper printer. For BAM, get down one. in China. I'm meeting with them maybe tonight. But I've already got a copy of the book that they printed for me so I could see their quality and it's really good. I sent it to Brian. He likes it. Of course, he's not sure about printing in China. But it's shipped here. It's less than 10 bucks a book.
01:07:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you were talking about that a while ago.
01:07:35 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
And looking into it. Yeah. I mean, unless I see a major red flag, I want to do it because like that's huge savings. Instant, you know, uh, and I'm.
01:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So glad you started the doc because I feel like we'll get better traction this month, just being able to have some back and forth. But I would really, really like you to consider. And I'm sorry, my daughter came in to see how long and then she let the dog in and he wants to. I don't know how long it's been since you've paid attention to your time and done any time tracking, but it might be good to do a little inventory on where time is going. And especially for summer and maybe just every summer kind of do that although it's going to change with the kids but with that being a teacher, you know it's kind of a good idea to have an idea of how does your schedule change during the summer. And so go ahead and just kind of do a time inventory tracking little bit just it's going to be roughly don't have to do it perfect but just really just pay attention to your time. Where it's going, especially with having the different things going on with tea And that potentially creeping up a little bit, but probably having a good return Seeing what you might want to change in your devotion to it You might want to increase it if it gets out on clickbank and it's doing well I know they're the marketing guys, but you know get your brain on it and going you know what I know some stuff to you Let me put some of this on it put some gasoline on it cuz it's actually really doing good Um stuff you're doing with him potentially getting one more new client to get that extra $5,000 a month buffer But then also making sure you've got time to think about Potentially having conversations with junior copywriters, whatever. So really looking at it and kind of Choosing a pace for the summer choosing the the main goals for the summer what you'd like to accomplish and also in Goals for the family like family trips whatever stuff you guys want to do and just really kind of you know how we've done our time blocking like out in advance. I would love you to kind of try to like if you just spent a few days this week through next week looking at what would I like to get done throughout the summer put them in this spreadsheet with the weeks out right and put the big rocks in there right we're vacation all week not barely touching anything or boot camp whatever like really get the chunks down all through the rest of the summer and then show that to me so that I can look at it with you and just go okay here's some new thoughts about how to part of it will be about how do we how do we give Titans a container that you feel good about but also that you're like okay inside of this can't container I'm going to maximize everything and you get the best but when that containers full, then I get to go play in my other playgrounds, which I'm really enjoying, and you know, so that you don't feel this burden or any building resentment as a result of it, because that does happen. And if you put it into a specifically chosen container, that should reduce the ability and the likelihood of having resentment build up about it, because you've put it where you want it to be and what you're okay with.
01:11:34 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Make sense? Yep.
01:11:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. So just because like we're already getting into July, and you know, that time goes really fast, especially with the kids, and I'm just getting older and faster and faster and faster, I would recommend scheduling out, you know, super rough draft, not major detail. The rest of your summer light that soon, and
01:12:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
and share it with me. OK, I'm in and knowing that. Sheet for myself. We packed a lot into in the May and June or the verification and.
01:12:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, fun.
01:12:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)

Hello, how are you?
00:00:12 - Dan Ryan (3)
Cleaners day and up on the poetry of my various furry friends.
00:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like it.
00:00:21 - Dan Ryan (3)
Doing calls, doing meetings, look out.
00:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's good, it's good. I got a full night's sleep and groceries just got delivered. My older daughter took my younger daughter to seminary and she's making dinner tonight. And there's a flipping spider on my ceiling. Hopefully I must go with this. A comment? I don't want to get it. I don't like spiders. But I am the only spider killer. I guess you get to live for a while. I don't feel like dealing with it.
00:00:59 - Dan Ryan (3)
I don't want to live.
00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's, it's no spiders. Anyway, what, uh, was it a work call you had just now?
00:01:12 - Dan Ryan (3)
Two, then I, uh, talked to developers at, uh, SOD at nine, and then I just had a meeting with Circle, because I was like, you know what, I'm going to look at these other community platforms, and I'm officially sold on Circle, Tina. It is.
00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Really? Yeah. Taylor, well, to agree with you.
00:01:35 - Dan Ryan (3)
Uh, okay. Uh, probably not for the reasons. I'm sure Taylor really didn't evaluate it and just copy Brandon Burshaw or something. Uh, I'm like talking to the guy like, okay, what if I want to send a, you know, I didn't, I was like, I have a CRM and what if I want to send people over from my CRM? So they're going to opt in. through this lead thing, and that's where I'm going to send them emails, and that's where I'm going to make offers and pitch ship and, right, because they don't really have massive email or whatever. mean, yeah, I don't think they even have it. And I go, and then I want to get them over and I want to tag them with the three things that I'm collecting in the form. He's like, yep, API, don't use apps. I go, okay, great, that could be that. And then I was like, all right, let's say I want to have a free level, and then I want to have different paid tiers. So let's have paid tier one is like a group coaching thing, or whatever, or, or it's one on one coaching, or let's say I want to do a cohort. So there's like a six week cohort. He's like, let me show you, opens up all these sites. He's like, you can do everything you just said. was like, God damn, really? It's like, okay, how do I generate the payment? it's like the payments here. You can make it. a month to month. So you can make it a full page, you can make it a month to month. You've got a link at the end. Okay, so I have that link. So if I'm on a sales call, for example, I can downsell to the page, that payment plan is ID up, and you just send in this link, I know it's in the link through the fee around, I go, okay, what if I want to, what if I want to take, I got this is further down the I go, if I want to take activity from, from circle and update my record in my CRM. So using mom as an example, I met with him and I talked about Ninja and mom. Not so much because I thought I would use it for Ninja, but he literally, the reason I said Brendan Bouchard is because he showed me Brendan's thing. So what they're releasing right now is a headless API, that you can take circle components and put it inside. Buddy balls, basically. So when he opened up Brendan's side, And was like, that's body boss. And he's like, it is? And he's yep. But he's like, well, that's what Brent. And he's like, I don't know who he's doing it for him. But he's like, they're doing it. So see, they had circles just iframed inside body boss, which looked good, as a matter of fact. And but now you can take components, like the feed component, and then have that in there. And your users are in body boss, but you're using circle. And I was like, he's like, so you don't have to pay millions of dollars to develop these widgets, because you can use ours. I'm like, oh, that's dope. I didn't know you could do that. He's like, it's not out. It's coming out like two weeks. He's like, you're just showing me because it sounds like you would get it. I definitely get it. So then Brendan's got someone doing it for him.
00:04:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like, I'm pretty sure I can find out who did that.
00:04:50 - Dan Ryan (3)
And then go talk to them. So yeah, I'm like, man, this is high levels. They're never going to catch up. of this. Schools never going to catch up to this. Like, these guys are way, way further ahead.
00:05:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but I went and just got that snapshot yesterday.
00:05:09 - Dan Ryan (3)
That's okay, because I do still think like you could do the sales calls.
00:05:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, you got what's natural? Community one that you showed me.
00:05:18 - Dan Ryan (3)
I think that can work. I do think that can work still, but for mom, because mom to me is going to be extremely complicated. So it's going to have, it's going to have all the things that I just said. You want a free tier, then you want a paid tier, then you want a government tier, then you want a dedicated error for fan flow users, then you want a dedicated area for people that are in. But we're, I don't know if this is going to be the name, but we have this continuous release strategy. So it'd be like, hey, no, you're going to pay to be in the continuous release strategy cohort. One, which starts in January, two starts in February 3 starts in March, and in that group, you are releasing a song every 8 to 12 weeks with whoever's in that 20-person cohort, whatever. So those would all need to be separate paid tiers and separate private groups. And I'm like, yeah, so at that level, I love them, right? I don't know. have no idea.
00:06:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think you leave it out with the communities, because if you can't do that, then that would be a deal breaker for me too, because I want multiple tiers. And one thing that Circle can do that I don't know if you came across it, but it gives you stats of who's logged in and what information they've consumed.
00:06:48 - Dan Ryan (3)
Yeah, you have to actually build some of that, he showed me that. Yeah. Interesting. The other thing that they have that is perfect for mom is spotify interest. I was like, oh, that's dope, and then they do mp3s, which we need, which high level doesn't support. So I was like, okay, but it's also like, you could do this headless thing and put it inside of high level. I was like, oh, that would be interesting. So you can still use high level and then just have circle inside of high level and he showed me another version of that. And it was just like the E card and he was saying, yeah, if you owe off, he kind of lost me. It was not super off on oh off, but he's like, imagine you just owe off your high level log in that you give them. It's the exact same log in for circles and they log in high level, they log in circle, they just don't know. It's like, yeah, that would be great. So yeah, but I'm not totally sold, but I was like, oh. of this headless API is super interesting.
00:08:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is a headless API?
00:08:08 - Dan Ryan (3)
I mean, it's like you're not you're not using the wrapper, right? So you're not using the container of it of circle. So you're using the compound, you're getting access to the components. You can do with WordPress too. So it's like, it's super lightweight. There's not a lot of other code. It's just a thing. It's fairly new. I hadn't really ever heard. I'd heard of it for WordPress. I had not heard of it for like one of these standalone softwares that was surprisingly said that I was like, oh, okay. I did not see that coming.
00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Interesting. Maybe. Oh,
00:09:00 - Dan Ryan (3)
But I'm looking at it more for, because we've been talking to these dudes grooved for the bands. So then I was like, I don't like those guys. And there's no way they're going to catch up to any of these people's school. You know, whether it's school or circle or it might be networks. But these guys are starting out and they're not even called Pepsi Sprite. They're nothing. They're like Fanta. They're never going to. But they're trying to target just musicians. that's sort of the value problem. But tech wise, they're texting.
00:09:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who's texting?
00:09:45 - Dan Ryan (3)
They're called groups.
00:09:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, wait, what is the group?
00:09:53 - Dan Ryan (3)
Okay, never run. Yeah, but it's the, it's those, I mean, props. It's those TikTok influencers. They're like, they got so much reach on TikTok. now they're like, oh, we do communities for all audiences. And they've gotten some of the biggest TikTokers to be on the platform. And they're, they're using that to attract other people. But the problem is the software itself stinks because it's a bunch of TikTokers developing software. Like, yeah, it's not good. It's not going to go well long term.
00:10:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think the, um, man, it's always so complex. There's so many things that have to be measured. So like the speed of implementation. So school is super fast to implement. That's really, to me, the only draw about it. There's a lot of drawbacks, including analytics, you have to pay for every community, um, they don't integrate, the communities don't integrate with each other really well, where you could do that with like circle. I think Circle is pretty quick to integrate, but also has a lot of complex features that you could do and it doesn't have a native app, but it does have an app. So that's good. You don't know if it has a magic link, which I think is really good for people that don't want to use the app and just want to be able to go straight to their content without having to log in and remember a password because a lot of people don't use password managers and they don't have an efficient login process. Yeah. But what I'm looking at in this high level community is it is convoluted. That was my issue with high level to begin with is that it's convoluted. It's there's. It's not pointing click. You know what I mean? It's not intuitive. And then same with Buddy Boss was the same thing.
00:11:51 - Dan Ryan (3)
So yeah, Buddy Boss is not intuitive at all.
00:11:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
no, you've got to have somebody who knows exactly what they're doing. And that is.
00:12:00 - Dan Ryan (3)
Not super easy to come by thing Yeah, what you need is like well, I mean, I think you got right the snapshot for high level is gonna have Hey do this or it's gonna build a bunching for you You would need something like that force you would need something like that for circle too But there's no snapshots right it's gonna be Build and you'd need someone that like he took me in a community that was clearly a coach and then doing individual coaching so like You would have like a damn thing so when I log into circle as like Let's say I'm like so I'm your high ticket level right so it's like you log in I'm high ticket I get access to everything like the courses or all the logs for me, but then I also have a dedicated damn coaching in the area they call it a coaching, but it's not literally the coaching area. And then inside that you could have Dan, Mark, blah, blah, blah, but Mark can't see Dan and Dan can't see Mark. So all I see under coaching is Dan. And then it's a dedicated stream of Dan and Tina. I was like that's interesting not be group.
00:13:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He goes, yeah.
00:13:25 - Dan Ryan (3)
Okay, I didn't see I didn't see that coming. I can say in the video, I asked him to send me the recording.
00:13:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's all it's interesting. So what are your priorities for the membership for mom?
00:13:45 - Dan Ryan (3)
So I've already proven I can generate a lead for under two dollars. And then they I think like 80% of them opted to join the Facebook group. But now I'm like, okay, I can just force and I can ask them if they want to join the community, if they assent, yes, and I can automatically go create the record in wherever I can do it in high level, I can do it in a circle. So then I go automatically create that record. So I'm not just putting in everyone, I'm putting in all the people that say yes, and then I'm tagging them as whatever, yes. And then the people that say no, I'm tagging them as no to invite them later. And then you would deliver potentially deliver the thing through the group and through email. So they're opting in, think I did two of the things I did, royalty release checklist and I did, no, I'm sorry, did a royalties checklist and then a release checklist. So they could get the thing in the group, or they could get the thing in the email either way. then ultimately they're for each, now we're going to Fletcher, if each thing is actually tied to a course, then you could sell them the course and deliver the course inside wherever, wherever that can be used. Then you have a free community that's just a bunch of people that are in the independent music space. And then I'm tagging them based on the first things that they tell me and then you'd enrich that, we let them enrich that through their profile, right? So the only thing I really ask them on the way in is what are you? And they're either a producer, engineer, an artist, a band, where those options are. So you would immediately be able to identify someone who's a band, come on up on that, possibly genre, and then you'd give them the ability to, hey, this is my Spotify thing. Because part of me has been mutilating, I forget who did this back in the day. I think it might have been Justin or somebody else. But... it was like in the community, they would go juice people's Facebook posts, right? just put up this ad, can you guys go like it? And then a bunch of people would just go like the ad and back at that time, that was an indicator to push the ad further for Facebook. So it was like the community was participating in juicing other things within the community. So my version of it is like, you earn credits. So you can, if you do it, you get a credit. And then you can then, once you have that credit, that credit can be spent when it's time to promote your song. It's like, okay, you have 10 credits, so you can now get 10 clicks. Something like that. So when someone released this song, it's Spotify. It's like, hey, my song's out, Ghost Treatment. That's the signal to Spotify. People are interacting, it's Ghost Treatment, whatever else, whatever the things are. So, or you don't do that. It's just that. community is supporting, right? I came and released this out, and one go go support it.
00:17:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, um, I don't know. They're so whatever. So, the circle has like gamification features in there. I think you're what you were talking about that they do actually.
00:17:28 - Dan Ryan (3)
But they have, they have a bad game and stuff, but it's not game. It's not game. It's your, you decide. So you can build an automation in the background that hands out badges and stuff. It's not, it's not like built in. It's your user. So you could be like, completed the cohort completed the course that he showed me that those are these options. Automations that you build. There's nothing made of. That's like, oh yeah, we automatically have this game of occasion component. Hmm. Yeah.
00:18:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, but and I don't know all the different ways that you could do it, but the idea that you have where the community supports each other with those credits for like listening to songs, downloading songs, whatever. I don't know. But I don't know that I heard the answer for like, like, if you were going to rank, first of all, if you were going to list the features that you want and then rank them, but I guess it doesn't matter if you found a solution that does everything that you want, but in the search for things, if you hadn't found everything, I would be curious to know what were the things that you had been looking for.
00:18:56 - Dan Ryan (3)
So, was it my list?
00:18:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it was Marx.
00:19:00 - Dan Ryan (3)
So, Mark was always shooting down this or the other so like the last thing he sent was oh MP3 and then not sport it was like do beyond having a dream and like yeah, we do That's kind of a deal breaker for a music community because everyone's dealing in mp3 or mp4 so there's no music no music in bed and and then Circle also just happen on Spotify. was like oh, that's even better But not or not because when you're when you're in the pre-production phase Imagine you're in a group that's producing it while I'm working on a producing a song to be released You can only have mp3s of that while you're saying okay. Here's the first mix. It's gonna be an mp3 It's not it's not publicly available. You could put it on SoundCloud, but you probably don't want to It did have a SoundCloud integration too, which I was like god damn really but So yeah, Mark, it was that and it was he doesn't like when you put a video in, he wanted like a full full video post, I love Facebook and school doesn't do that, high level doesn't do that. So that was more of like just a UI sort of thing. School doesn't do it and high level is copying school, so therefore they don't do it. Circle doesn't. Mighty networks did it. Then as far as like, then there was just having the different, the pride of any sort of paywall, right, so I don't know school has a paywall. So having the free thing and then a paywall.
00:20:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, I think I like this. It's one or the other. You can either have a free group or a paid group, but you cannot have two tiers.
00:21:00 - Dan Ryan (3)
Oh, see, school, you can have like nine, you can have unlimited tears. You mean circle? Um, circle, yeah. Um, and then the main thing he doesn't like about high level is it's built around courses, as opposed to being courses is part of it. So it's not really community, it's courses plus community, and he wants community first, there might never be courses, right? So what if, especially if you're dealing with just a band, a band is never going to have a course ever. Right. So he's like, we tried to, he's actually building community and more on that, um, trying to see how it goes. But that was the main sticking point is that it's like, uh, he's like, no, that doesn't fit for a band. What is a band teaching someone?
00:21:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like, no, you're right.
00:21:57 - Dan Ryan (3)
But I was like, we could use this for mom. He could put our core like it totally fits for forces first teaching first community second, but the this scenario is completely flip-flop. It's community first forces second. like, okay, then it makes sense. I mean, I guess that's probably the best way to look at it is that. Yeah, it's it's it's need community forward, not forces forward. So I like I went through this dude.
00:22:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I took him through like ninja explain what ninja was.-hmm.
00:22:37 - Dan Ryan (3)
it was like the ninja falls apart with our MCQ product. He's like, yeah, no. like, you're you'd never be like, he's like, I'm not saying you can't you have developers probably could. But he's like, then that's when he showed me Brandon Bouchard's thing and I said, was like, that's buddy boss. I was like, oh, okay, that's kind of interesting. So we could head this. BPS circle into because I think buddy bosses community stuff stinks It's like oh This could be better And then we can do the stuff like you know, we log them into our MCQ software from within buddy boss They don't know that they left.
00:23:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's like, oh, never gonna be able to do that Yeah, For me and and and also why which I know you think is proactive avoidance, but for me, it's really it's it's tactical learning Because it's hard for me to comprehend the user experience without having the user experience and Trying to create a list of what are the features that matter most like I can think of some things for me The course is the most important thing but community is really important as well because Because if I can leverage the conversation of other people in the community to kind of create almost like a gravitational pull towards the content, because there's also other people there. but but then you don't even know until you've done it does that work or not, you know, yeah, and so it's all theoretical. And it's just, it's just thoughts upon thoughts upon thoughts until you do it and experience it. And that's the biggest thing is that I, um, whatever, I think if the list of the main things are there, then whatever else trade offs that you make, like, we know nothing's going to be perfect. But as long as the main features that you need are there and they're solid, then, you know, you don't have to move. But if you do move. I don't know, it's a whole nother thing. It's so hard just trying to build on something.
00:25:07 - Dan Ryan (3)
And also for you, you're like going top down. You might never get down, right? if you're currently at high ticket.
00:25:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Explain what you mean down.
00:25:17 - Dan Ryan (3)
Right, so the opposite would be free low ticket, mid ticket, high ticket, right? And you're at high ticket. So community is really more for the free, right?
00:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's where the community still is going Agreed.
00:25:31 - Dan Ryan (3)
So if you had me and Mark and someone's in Quasimodo or whatever that guy's name is, like, if they were all...
00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, wait, wait, who's Quasimodo? I don't know, but the doctor. Oh, Boogie. Boogie.
00:25:44 - Dan Ryan (3)
So if like me and Mark, right? If you're trying clients, we're in a community.
00:25:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're not going to go in the community.
00:25:53 - Dan Ryan (3)
No. No, I might go in there, I might go in there because there's something there for me, right? Right. You're like, hey, log in. I need you to log in and watch this video. Like we're going to talk about this next week. Yeah, I'm going to be in there for that. And so there, but there might be some discussion. I could see Mark, you know, Mark loves to talk, right? And me too, right? I might comment back to someone, right, in that context. we're not going to get in this back and forth discussion.
00:26:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I wouldn't even have my high level clients would never be there. Because first of all, I'm not giving somebody access to all my people, right? And be like, hey, guess what? These are all the people for you to try to coach or something like that. I'm not really afraid of it. It's just kind of the thing that I have embedded in my mind because of the texture. But also, it's super high touch. Like why would I downgrade our interaction?
00:26:45 - Dan Ryan (3)
Well, I'm not saying it's to downgrade.
00:26:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So my point was that you have those people.
00:26:50 - Dan Ryan (3)
And yeah, you could be like, hey, the stuff's here. And I would go do this thing, right? And then when you go down to the next level, and what is the next level? The next level is like course buyers. Even them, even them, whoever they are, it's not going to be super cheap, but it's still going to be whatever. And a lot of what your stuff teaches them is antithetical to wasting time in the community, right? It'd be like, you need to be in your business. So I don't see you ever going down to this tier where there's like, just community, right? Like, like, what's exactly what's going to happen to my mom? Mom's going to start. We're going to try and turn free people into customers.
00:27:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're not. No, I am. I am. And here's why, because it's more of a kind of give back type of thing. It's not about the logical approach to getting high level clients, although it does happen because I'm that person. And I've seen other people do it where they go buy the free thing, really high level people and just go like, oh, they know what they're talking about. But then they circumvent it. They don't go by the course or do anything else like that. They're like, hey, how do I hire you, that type of thing. But for me, it's the long term play, right? It's the ascension. It might take two, three, four, five years for somebody to get to, they become a high level client, but I've been teaching them the whole time. And it's also more of instead of having a blog where it's just one-sided and or instead of sending out emails, it's just a content home. It's a content medium source, and that, for me, is more about energy. It just feels like, right? It's not different. Email would work just as well. A blog could work just as well, Facebook just as well. It's just a preference of psychologically what it feels like to put it inside of something called a community. You know what I mean? Yeah. But then are you going to go like live once a week, teeny hours, like, so I'm not doing it by myself. I'm going to do this with Maria.
00:29:10 - Dan Ryan (3)
She loves this. This is what I saw in one of groups like, so one of the groups that he showed me was for Alcatraz North, and I might have been with him, to be honest, and that I could see like, you know, their calendar or whatever, what I was going to get. Yeah. So I imagine they are doing that. They're saying, hey, get in on this on a time block freebie. And then, you know, then they're in the community and you go from there.
00:29:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Um, exactly that we, and I've been talking about it with her because, so she bounces all over the place.
00:29:47 - Dan Ryan (3)
That's her biggest issue.
00:29:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I hardly noticed that about her. And my biggest issue is I don't want to be on video. I don't want to do all these things, but they're really good at drawing in people fast because you can connect. Now, I don't, it's not that I mind being on video so much, it's just, I don't want to talk to myself or talk to a camera. It's just so weird. And it's so, I'll have human conversations all day long. So I want to have somebody to talk to and do it with, and I want somebody else's brain that I can access frequently. And so, anyway, if we do it with, she needs all the conversation, wants to have all the conversations. And she does marketing, I do business operations, all the mental stuff. So it's a really good blend. And that's been a huge other part of reason why I haven't done this because I'm like, I don't want to do it by myself. I've never wanted to do it by myself. I do enjoy the community. do enjoy people. love teaching, answering questions. don't even mind having live conversations, but, and this is one of the other reasons why I wanted to be so inexpensive. said, I hate showing up. So I did group coaching where people paid a lot of money, but even they didn't show up the calls. Part of it was because I gave them so much work and and so much stuff to do that they didn't need to show up on the call. They knew what to do and they were doing it. So I need to vog you because somebody needs to show up and have questions. Somebody needs to show up and want to talk, otherwise there's no point in having the call. And it's just, you know, depressing to show up and be like, there's nobody here. Like, what am I doing?
00:31:32 - Dan Ryan (3)
You know what I mean?
00:31:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if it's lower priced, you can have much more volume, but then it's also, if I'm doing a long-term strategy, I could be teaching hundreds or thousands of people how to, and I don't really care. But I write if I can help, then I'll help. And it's not like Glenn, I want to be in everybody's homes. I don't really care.
00:31:52 - Dan Ryan (3)
But if I can help you, I want to help you.
00:31:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He doesn't, but yes. But, um, so, you know, and the special actually this thing that I've been doing like spent all Saturday shooting videos, whatever, just just teaching this stuff. But if I can teach people the fundamentals, and it takes them a few years, but they become, you know, more sovereign, more independent, more self-reliant, all these things, then I'm really happy about it. And in the course of it, for sure, somebody's going to be like, hey, go hire this girl, whatever, because that's how my business has been from the beginning. Somebody said, hey, go hire her, or they saw post or whatever. So the secondary consequence will be somehow, even if I don't have a funnel built specifically for it, though I will, higher level clients will come. And I don't want a lot of them, I can't have a lot of them because it's a high level interaction for me, high level like, um, yeah, person type of thing. So anyway, I just want to be able to have enough of the simple thing, things that the people want and to fulfill them and but some of my brain goes into gamification and all these other things which do get better retention and engagement but I have to start from the beginning with just getting the content filled and all that stuff. For you though because there's so many complex things and because your angle is so tactical like for me I just need people to consume the stuff and then go do it. Yeah the other factor for me people who and created people are different beasts though like you really have to you have to make it tiny little pieces of actionable actionable actionable pieces that they go and do or there's no value for them because if they don't do it they're not publishing their content they're not making money they're not succeeding then they're not going to keep paying you and That's really important.
00:34:02 - Dan Ryan (3)
Anyway, sorry to go ahead. Yeah, no, the other factor that is in my mind is I'm looking at fan flow in mom strictly from an acquisition perspective. So I'm like, I need to think about, so when I sell this, what do I want to be selling people, right? So I look at, I'm like, okay, circle might be the right thing, because I can just say it's built on circle. So you don't, you don't write, oh yeah, here you go. And the same thing could happen with high level, right? So that was what my original thing was like, oh, it's built on high level. It's all in fan flow. But if their community thing is not going to cut it, then I can go, oh yeah, you're buying our white labels as here and you're buying our circle community here, not a Facebook community. So it's like, they're both assets, as opposed to, because my original plan was, hey, I'm going to build it in buddy boss, which I could still do with the buddy ball circle at this API, I I don't know. I think I would need to do it for that. So then I can remove that because that, to me, and I have the same thought in mind with another 71, like, that's sort of like, oh, yeah, no, you can't just take this over, right? I can't tell you how often the body of a sight breaks, right?
00:35:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like the woo integration or whatever.
00:35:22 - Dan Ryan (3)
If you remove, if I can remove some of that, which I can never remove from Ninja, like, we're too far into it. Actually, I guess I could think about it. If we've migrated all the subscriptions to Stripe, which could be done, you could, in theory, sell someone through woo, then populate them into a circle. I just don't know if I want do that. And it will never work without an Instagram. But for mom, I'm like, okay, I want these to be sellable assets that I can just hand over and not. Oh, yeah, no, you're gonna need some WordPress developers to maintain this community. it's not fun. I just want to be able to walk away. So that is a factor that is totally good in my mind when I'm looking at like, so I'm doing very much what you were just talking about earlier. It's like, I'm looking at like, I'm trying to look at the construction, like, how do I want this constructed for these like, what does Mark want features wise? What does Dan want acquisition wise? Those are sort of the two factors. Yeah, I have, I don't care what the functionality is from a community this aspect because I don't even go to the community that I own.
00:36:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:36:39 - Dan Ryan (3)
And I won't go in this one.
00:36:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do think I did like circle. There was something I didn't like about it that it didn't do, but I don't remember.
00:36:54 - Dan Ryan (3)
not really an LRM at all, which I didn't think it was, but it definitely is not.
00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
L. R.
00:37:01 - Dan Ryan (3)
M. Learning relationship manager, right? So I don't know. We didn't really get into like building the course, but I think it's, I don't, I didn't see anything that was like learned dash or like, or like what it's, it's community forward. So it's community with courses, whereas I think school and high level because I was taking school is flippity flopped. It's courses with community, but I would say is the big difference. I can't even ask him that. He's my, he's my content, Jacob.
00:37:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. um, that I'm trying to remember, but I feel like being giffic had a community that went with that as well.
00:37:51 - Dan Ryan (3)
Yeah, I don't like them.
00:37:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like you. Yeah. Well, uh, no, didn't like this one. Hmm. so yeah, just like if you could get a bullet point list just for clarity, right? So that you're just going off of the list of functionality features and ask Mark, what does he want, but also why do you want it and rank it like? And I also think that it's preemptive of any kind of issues that you probably will have with them down the road, which is, Oh, I don't like this. And I want to move or I want this or I want that kind of thing and just in that discussion be like, okay, so we can't have everything that we want, no matter what, we cannot make wave a magic wand. What are the most important things that need to happen? And really the feature should be as a request of what are the things that need to happen for the people we sell to, for our artists.
00:39:01 - Dan Ryan (3)
Yeah, there's, yeah, for sure. Mark definitely is like, I've always imagined a lot of my bro.
00:39:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that would be cool, if.
00:39:09 - Dan Ryan (3)
Yep. I'm like, dude, now, like, what, it's, you're going to give them what they need, right? They don't need that, so what do we need, not what would be cool? Right. Because he's always like, oh, yeah, if we could build the button, we could build them at it. Like, I mean, I still don't think he totally understands it like, you know, we would be nowhere right now. We weren't white, we didn't buy that over. If we had to build an app that did all the core function there, we'd be, we'd be nowhere though. In the, in the seven months we've been doing this, we'd be absolutely nowhere.
00:39:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:39:51 - Dan Ryan (3)
Right. it's, you're, one of your favorites, it's like, we have to leverage these things, but you have to leverage them intelligently. That's our ties too. Sorry, what do you need right the intelligence comes in?
00:40:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you mean? Yes, that is going to be the the name that I decided that I'm going to use I love Dexter loves my freedom systems He's always like thought I should build around that and I think that I will but I think that might be like a free content source Later, whatever, but I'm gonna call it leverage systems because Leverage is first of all lots of people talking about it now, which is good Not necessarily in terms of like systems, but it's just a word because when you go to the site, right? You see the word I wanted to be a word that people are thinking of often They need to be thinking about it often and outside of business or People who are having that conversation. It's not something that comes up for the average person Period the average person is not leveraging anything not optimizing not leveraging and not system demonetizing. But those things are the path to freedom and less trust, no matter what you're talking about. House management, know, meal planning, health management, it doesn't matter what it is. It's getting the most out of the least. And those are the those are the ways to get it. But for Mark, one one like, so I have three questions that you could ask him that probably should be things that you repeat constantly. Every time he or Sean or anybody else starts to veer off tracks so that you can veer it like so you can get it back on track. For your artists, well, it's kind of four things. What are the most important things that need to happen for your artists? First one, why isn't that happening for them right now? You could talk about all the behaviors, right? But what isn't happening for them right now? Why is it not happening? And then how does your solution? make it happen for them. How does it change that? So there's, number one, that makes sure that you build the solution correctly and simply, but it also gives you all the selling points that you need because, um, and that kind of goes into like Jean Schwartz's level of awareness, right? So, is somebody coming to you that has no idea about what should happen for them? Or why? I just, I like creating music. That's all I know, right? And somebody else knows that it's because I don't know how to publish music often or I don't have a label or whatever. Like, so there's different levels of awareness all the way through. part of your path should be being able to ascend people from level zero to level. I think there's like eight levels of awareness seven, something like that. Yeah. But also known. at what level do the greatest amount of conversion happen? And at that level, what do they need to hear? But basically, what is the message for every level so that they get to the next level next level until they become a customer? And then making sure that whatever you have promised is what you can fulfill. So, I mean, that's all obvious, but a lot of times we don't approach it with that type of specificity. And I think that it would help the guys be able to do their parts best if they could think about it like that.
00:43:45 - Dan Ryan (3)
Yeah, they don't think about it like that they think. I know. Especially Mark. Like Mark's just thinking.
00:43:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's just an existential conversation, Sean. Tina? Yeah, exactly.
00:43:58 - Dan Ryan (3)
So that's, I mean, that's where they They have these things and then they, I mean, this is a good thing about Mark now is like he has these things and he then he'll filter them through me and he'll go, I want to do this and I go, okay, and then ask some qualifying questions and go, okay, let me think about that one. me think about that. For example, yesterday, literally email text me, he goes, Dan, if you, if you had a hundred million dollars, and you needed to 10x, 10x it in five years, what type of business would you build? And I said, why would I want a hundred million dollars? And then he's like, oh, no, you have to, you have to use a hundred million dollars. I go, okay, no, I don't, I don't want a hundred million dollars. But I said, okay, well, so then you're, you're saying, how would I build a billion dollar company, right? I said, market's the same. It's the same point as an idea money execution, but now what you're telling me is money is not the problem. Money's taking care for real, like it totally didn't do. Okay, then that then execution, don't it up. Period. You've got a hundred million dollars you're responsible for. So then that leaves you an idea. So you're asking me what is a billion dollar idea that I could come up with and then scale 10x in five years. And then I went to the good old buddy chat GPT and started doing some research and I showed him. No company has done that in the last decade. That's a current billion dollar company. They did it in six. They did it in 12. The only one that actually did it was Instagram, which is an acquisition. And they did it in two years. And it was like, like, dude, you're talking about a sparkly unicorn among the unicorns. And then when I did this analysis, I said, if you look at these companies. Then the and look at the models the model would be a subscription based business Because you can alex that all a our honor right now ten eight, but I'm like What subscription based business would you would what I build like I don't know I? Don't know, but you could you'd have to figure it out. You know, can now go backwards from there and then I said I wouldn't I'm not interested in this. I'm not interested in these shekels Oh DC shackles right to me. It's like a prison.
00:46:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Why would I take DC money? Oh, V.
00:46:38 - Dan Ryan (3)
C. thought you said Whatever it is I want what I want to do is This is the other thing about the community for this is I want to build a community and then crowds equity crowds I'm through the community community. So equity crowd fund this new way of being an independent musician from independent musicians, but then they're equity crowd funding into the label or whatever it is, whatever this upper level of mom is, it's more than a label. It's this label that has courses and software, and it has distribution money, and it has buying this idea of buying catalogs and revitalizing them, and then it has a label, and label services app side to it. So you have this multi faceted business that has six or seven revenue streams, but they're all related to one thing. It's like, well, that's what we should do. But you have to go build that community and we can build that community for $1 or $2 per person at a time, then go raise $1 million. Then you know, hey, if I had a million dollars and I plugged you into this, like, yeah, you give me a hundred million dollars and I'm plugging it into what, like, you'd have to go figure out that idea and then you cannot screw it up because you're responsible for a hundred million dollars. Like, it's ludicrous, to be totally honest, like, it's completely ludicrous. Why would you need to spend, and then I pointed out, okay, look at these, it was like 11 companies. Now, point out the one that spent a hundred million dollars. You can't because they didn't from, like, and then also I go, whoever this hundred million dollars, tell me the companies on this list that they have money invested in. I'll bet it's not because they've never done this. So they're asking you for an outcome that, hey, doesn't really exist just because you have a hundred million dollars, doesn't mean it's going to work. So it would all rest on the idea and I was like, yeah, no, dude, I'm not
00:49:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's that he's focused on a hundred million.
00:49:08 - Dan Ryan (3)
That's exactly that's exactly like whatever percentage he and his mind who thinks he would get of a billion. I'm like dude that is such a again it's the grand slam bottom of the night. It's so it's so him.
00:49:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The priority is the dollar sign without any parameters. No without any without any parameters right. So I mean you can make a lot of money selling your body.
00:49:41 - Dan Ryan (3)
You can make a lot of money doing a lot of different things right.
00:49:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have never even seen that last night. I just keep hearing it all time and I I only know a little bit. I'm extra tells me I'm naive a lot but I'll stay that way. That's okay. I mean, I've never thought of myself this night, but then a little bit sometimes, maybe anyway. But yeah, it's anyway, and that's where the questions come in all the time, and that it might be good for you to just have a few taint of questions stuck in your head that you always ask, like, at what cost and what's the trade off? Although, I think that what cost is something that you do bring up, but I don't think necessarily to all the people you talk with, because you're just like, you're being stupid.
00:50:35 - Dan Ryan (3)
I'm not even entertaining it, right? So I'm like, I'm focused on how do we get this MVP? How do we get this MVP done?
00:50:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My point is, I think your life would be so much easier with just a few questions thrown out that just kind of stop people's brains from going down the track, which is they can't not, well, they can, they can ignore the question, but if you say okay we're not continuing the conversation until you answer the question at what cost because what they'll want to do is redirect and they'll ignore the question and they'll carry on which is a waste of time and energy. We're like okay well I'm gonna go do something else let me know when you want to answer the question at what cost you know what's the trade.
00:51:18 - Dan Ryan (3)
Yeah yeah so here's the thing is that I think unfortunately this is it's like it's it's like a required thing with him because he is like this sales guy right he's sort of determined that before so he loves to go to meetings he says he doesn't but he loves it he loves to he loves to network right he like he was just backstage at like he was hanging out with the lead singer of God smack the other day they will like went to some show and that he was back backstage at some other show the other night and and then he you know I I know he just got off a call where about a hundred million came up and so he wants to jump all over it. So with that there's good and bad right so that that's a bad but I don't want to tell him like dude stop having these conversations because he should be doing it that is what he's good at that is his role and more often than not he there is a benefit from it right so when he was backstage at that first show now he reconnected with someone and that guy's got 300 bands and the guy's like I want to bring every one of my bands on evangelize what yeah and then he met the lead he reconnected with the lead singer of this band seven dust he was like kind of big in the 90s and they're like dude how do we get on fan flow so they're coming on and that that that's that was the connect it was their manager it was like I'll get there. demo, but I've got 300 other bands. And then he now he's going to meet with, I think this is through God's Mac dude, he's going to meet with Dottree and, uh, can't remember their name, this other breaking Benjamin. So like those guys might be start using fan flow. So it's like, okay. And the, all these meetings are in the context of music business. It's just that sometimes they're these loopy, this one. I was like, okay, you know what? He's, he's two for three this last week on these meetings. And like, all right, I guess, I guess it's an acceptable sort of form. I was actually telling Eric the day, like, we're so close. I feel like we need to be in the same room again. Like I did when I went out there before. And I was like, it's almost like we need to do a hackathon and like just, Let's be in the same room. there's just all this little crap floating around. And it's like, I feel like we just need to go to Boston and go there for like five days and just be like, in these five days, we're gonna get all this done. It's gonna get all cleaned up. So that all we're waiting for is Spotify approval and everything else is done. Like that's the only piece that's outside of our control, which it is, and then we could have everything else ready for the MDP. I mean, based on the meetings I had today, those guys are gonna build those two things. We've set to make sure the second piece, I'm not 100% sure, and I have to get a free trial there. So if I get a free trial, tell them to issue it on Monday, and then those guys will go figure that out. And then everything else should be done probably within this month, maybe in October. So I was like, I mean, we could go there in like October. We don't want to go there in November until then. And just bang it all out. It's like, okay, here's the hit list. Strong order sandwiches.
00:55:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's go.
00:55:08 - Dan Ryan (3)
And then be ready for like one Spotify, instead of the approval, and then we can start selling this thing.
00:55:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I just realized the time, I need to go. I'm just gonna have to ask next week.
00:55:27 - Dan Ryan (3)
Okay.
00:55:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, anyway, it's good. It's good. I feel like there's, I don't know, dialing in a little bit more. I could probably tuck your ear off for about another two hours, asking you questions about stuff that you're working on. Also, we'll not talk, but just ask both the things. Cause that does both the things. So wait, next week, I'm traveling, but not until Friday, I have my call. Yeah. I will bother you next week. I mean, help, I mean, be Tina. No. Enjoy your. perch time and your puppies. Oh wait, when does Abel and go to school?
00:56:05 - Dan Ryan (3)
Does she go to school next week? Oh, Saturday. This Saturday? Yeah, we're gonna fly up here and Saturday. It's so whack. Like, so we fly up and Saturday again. And then this time we're gonna stay over because Abel's like, I guess she could stay over.
00:56:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
guess she wants us to stay over.
00:56:24 - Dan Ryan (3)
So then Denise is like, are we staying over? go, yeah, I got over time. We're staying over. Um, we're gonna fly up, drive, find out again. And then they sent a notification yesterday, this is the school, with like parents or drop off people, whatever it was. You have 15 minutes to move them in. I'm like, And then like, you have a 15 minute window, you have to leave, leave at the end of the 15. You cannot hang around. And your car needs to be out in that 15 minutes of the next group. I'm like, that's bizarre. That is bizarre. You have to move everything in in 15 minutes, not everything, the bulk of the stuff. you can reconnect with your student later and figure out what's missing or what's thing you're staying over.
00:57:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's wild.
00:57:15 - Dan Ryan (3)
We're going to go move her in for 15 minutes and then leave and then and then reconnect with her around dinner, I guess.
00:57:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I'm glad you're saying that because that sounds like a lot of anxiety for a lot of kids. It's and family.
00:57:30 - Dan Ryan (3)
don't remember what mine was like, but I don't remember there being a time limit.
00:57:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's wild. All right, well, good luck dad and family this weekend and I will talk to you on Monday.
00:57:45 - Dan Ryan (3)
All right,

I'm going to do on my phone because I can't find the other link.
00:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was just emailing it to you because I sent that to both of you, sorry, yeah.
00:00:23 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Let me just change the settings so I can use the camera.
00:00:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, you don't have to, we can still talk, let's just look, there you go. Here we go. Hello. Hi, sorry.
00:00:46 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
I'm having issues every week.
00:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, as long as you don't get frustrated by it, I don't get frustrated by it, it just is what it is, but anyway, sorry, thank you for rolling with it. It's a cool, calm and collected. It's good, baby. How are you, Ben?
00:01:06 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Good.
00:01:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah?
00:01:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Brining away.
00:01:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Grinding away.
00:01:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
00:01:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That business. You do have some fun though, right?
00:01:18 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah, I don't know, weekends. mean, every time I go to the gym, I'm like happy, you know?
00:01:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, you get that oxytocin when you lift heavy weights?
00:01:28 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
I'm sure that, but I did not know that.
00:01:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I just learned that this year and I was like, that makes sense because I'm happiest when I'm like, for it. I'm also aggressive, so that might have a little something to do with it, but I'm just going to say it's about the opposite of it. Some good chemicals. So the size of last week, I'm a scare little AI. It was funny, actually we were comparing, it's not funny, but we were comparing AI notes and how badly it summarizes things or names people or whatever and it's a nightmare, but I've never had anything as bad as somebody being afraid of losing their job. So that was not fun last week. I was thinking about it makes me sick to myself. Okay, anyway, so let's start with just kind of what, where has your mind been besides, so I'm going to preempt this with when you're a grinder and you're operating, know, you just tackle stuff and knock it out. And operational mode is just operational mode. When I talk to you, when I ask you, like, what have you been thinking about this week? I want to know about the higher level thoughts, the ponderings, the things that you think, oh, you know,
00:03:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
a wonder if we try this or just kind of things you caught yourself observing about maybe processes or just just the business in general what you notice is good what you notice might be better things like that you find yourself contemplating from time to time just like oh one way or the other oh yeah lately it's been like how can I I make things move a little bit faster because I know Sam she told me how she plans like her months and it's like you know at the beginning of this month she's already getting ready for the next whereas I've been more like starting this month like let's get this month you know a good month this month but I'm trying to do it like a month ahead meaning if I could send a demand out as soon as possible this month then I can prepare for it to get done towards the end of this month, early next month, whereas right now, it's more like, you know, once it comes to me that I'm like, okay, I'll send it now. I'm just trying to be in control of how the months will end up as much as possible. So I mean, I've been going through the cases seeing like what I'm able to get started now that way. know, when next month comes around, I have a good idea. Okay, this one's going to settle. We'll be able to get this client as money next month. So more like efficiency as opposed to just, you know, grinding it out day by day.
00:04:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Exactly. So that's what we've been talking about though. And I would love to know talking about is, so what are the priorities? priorities and the priorities for the day will be relative to what's coming down the pipeline, right? And ranking by different types of things. So first of all, if you've got a customer or a client, what you guys call them clients? is impatient and there's a risk of sub-out that automatically needs to be high priority, right? And if it's, so one of the things that you should do, I know we talked about a list of some things, but and I can send this to you, hold on, I'm trying to think about the best way to do it to make sure that we get it captured, but one of the things that you could do is have kind of a ranking document for yourself and for your team. So basically, You look at, you know, let's, let's figure this out. So when you start your day, how do you guys decide what's to work on?
00:06:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Me or the team?
00:06:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Both, because the team is you also.
00:06:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
What I always look through emails really quickly, that's like my kind of gauge of what to do if there's like an upset client email, which we got yesterday, like I see it, and I'll handle that right away. If I see that distribution came in, I'll send that out to the client right away that way. You know, by the end of the day, hopefully it's done and signed and we can get that done. The subtleness that came in, it goes out of the way, and then I'll go through my case list and see what's, what's ready to be closed, what I can send out. I'll And then once I kind of go through that, then I go back into my email and kind of read through like what documents came in that are going to help push cases forward, negotiating things like that.
00:07:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so I'm going to go hang out with a friend. So, this is me trying to think about like years' worth of systems and figuring out the smallest thing to say, but okay, so one of the things that we talked about doing, that is very tedious and people don't like doing is time tracking for two weeks. And it's not about micromanagement but it's about having a clearer understanding about where your time goes. So you have a lot of different types of tasks and there's a lot of mental shifting that happens throughout the day. We will choose our tasks for different reasons at different times. Sometimes it will be mood. Sometimes it will be it's just in our face and we don't have to think about anything else. So we do that. Sometimes it's because somebody else decided it was urgent by their attitude, their tone, whatever.
00:08:44 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
It could be your team. It could be the client. It could be your team because of the client, right?
00:08:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Brought it to your table. But that's reactive and what we want to do now. we're human beings so some things will be reactive. So like if a fire happens you're reacting to the fire but if you don't react to the fire what happens it's a big problem right so sometimes you have to be reactive but we want to plan for and create the ideal environment and system and routine that first of all prevents fires as much as possible. Second of all ensures the fastest recovery when you get derailed because the fire came and you had to deal with something that took a lot of time took a lot of energy took a lot of resources with the team whatever that type of thing. So understanding and segmenting your day and your week based off of types of tasks based off of priorities knowing that everything does have to get done and then also based off of your rhythm. So certain types of tasks are better done at certain times a day. Now there's a kind of a standard circadian rhythm to that. It doesn't apply to everybody. So for instance, statistically most people do better at higher cognitive function tasks like math earlier in the day. And anything passed like lunchtime one o'clock to a clock, that would be better for like task work, grunt work, where you're not having to be strategic, not having to calculate, you know what I mean? So those types of tasks. So what would be a really good exercise, which is not going to be a one and done kind of thing. Everything you do is going to be iterative. I'm just going to keep repeating that and improvement. But is really looking at what what are your types of tasks? What is the mental load of them? What is the you know social load of it? Because obviously if you're in a place where you just want to deal with people less at times a day, right? There'll be sometimes we want to deal with people face to face less or on the phone less or whatever. You want to be able to kind of plan those times for that time of the day. But what should be fluid is knowing that because we're human different things will happen. Those moods will up and flow. They won't always be at the same time every day. So knowing and just kind of checking in with yourself, okay, like my brain's on fire right now. What's the highest level thing I can do with this? Like everything's calculating. I got a savant thing like beautiful mind going on right now. Where can I apply that? That's going to be the best thing to do, right? And that's planning, strategy, it may be trying to figure out a problem for a client that needs to be solved. That's really a good planning strategy leading type thing. And then when you're in a mood where you're just like, I don't want to deal with anything, I can just panel paperwork, but that's about it. So you want to kind of plan a schedule throughout the day that is your norm, right? And when you recognize like you're just not at the ideal place for this thing, rather than grinding, you want to go through your types of tasks and look at it and go, you know what, I'm better suited for this type of thing. Now, sometimes that's not going to work. You may have like a few bad days altogether. We won't necessarily call them bad days, but the energy shift is different. What you can do is different, it may have nothing to do with you. may be the cases that have come through. It could be people, know, whatever the whole... No crazy retrograde thing like sometimes people just lose their mind collectively at the same time, you know, and like you got to you got to deal with that whatever is causing it there's definitely a vibe shift that tends to be like around so if you also take that kind of stuff into account and just look at it so what are the types of things so what I would love to do is kind of create a list together and maybe we create it as a spreadsheet and I'll start it and then we'll just like screen share and look at it and talk a little bit about requirements from you like what does it take out of you can you like knock it out no time no matter what the awesome at it can some of these be a little bit taxing you know when you're having to make calls our distributions taxing any of that type of stuff. So let's kind of categorize the activities that you have to do and then Bob. part of what we think you spend time on, you don't have to do the time tracking. It's always been, every time I've had somebody be willing to do it, revelatory for them. In that generally, they spend more time doing a thing than they think that they do. And that tends to be helpful because then we figure out, oh, that's the thing that we could improve the process on. We could get more training on or delegate to somebody who's a rock star at that type of thing. So, again, it's never about micromanaging. It's about getting information. So, how do you feel about going through and just kind of talking about the tasks that you have throughout the week, of ranking them in terms of value to the business, ranking them in terms of how much it has to be. Patrick, that does it versus somebody else on the team. And then kind of putting the, maybe the energy or the mental resources. that is higher priority. And we're talking super ambiguous now. So once we get the spreadsheets started and we start kind of putting things into containers, then it gets more specific, then it gets more clear, then the value starts to come out. But I'm talking about let's just create spreadsheet. Right now, screen share, do this together as an activity and see what we see.
00:16:25 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Okay.
00:16:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. So let me go. Go sheet. I'm sure. I don't want to make it only to me, you're not behaving or being slow, that's the problem. I am not in the mood for waiting for things, I normally have blazing fast and it's going to be like lagging on me. Okay, Patrick, if I share with you at SweetLaw, is that Google account that you can get to Google Docs or do you need to have a Gmail account?
00:17:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
And now you rejoin the Zoom on the computer? Yeah. Okay, might be easier.
00:17:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm-hmm.
00:17:47 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Okay.
00:18:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, so if I want to share a Google Sheet with you, what email should I use?
00:18:15 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Don't Patrick at sweetlaw.com.
00:18:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, I think we're going to count that. And then I will screen share. It's your screen. Okay, okay. So you said we had distributions. I already forgot what you told me. Settlements. You reviewed caseless. Okay, so one thing I'm going to do is, like, the description of process. Okay. The reason for this is I'm not asking for what has to be done for distributions. What I'm asking in settlements or review case and anything else. What I'm asking for is, what is your process for deciding that is the thing you're going to spend this minute on, right? Because you have a whole case list, and it's just going to keep getting bigger. So what we're trying to figure out is, what is. the, almost like the equation for saying, this is the thing I'm going to spend my time on now out of all these cases. So when I ask for the description of process, that's it. What's your mental process for going? This is what I'm going to work on now.
00:20:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
I mean, sometimes it'll just come from, if I get an email and look at what it is, and it's like the last thing we need to be able to get a distribution. So I'll just go ahead and request it at that time. Like every like 15 minutes, I just check my email, see what comes up at the top. It's just like a habit. Because in order for distribution, like you usually know like not everything comes in at once to be able to close a case or usually waiting on like one item. Also come from when I review the case list, you know, I'll see that case. I'll go through it. I'm like, okay, we need this. I'll call real quick, follow up, I get it, then I can request distribution.
00:21:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Now, I would imagine distributions when it gets to that point, that's high priority. That's, we don't want to drag our feet. That needs to get moved forward ASAP, right? can you think of anything that as a category, we're not talking about extenuating circumstances, but as a category would rank higher than
00:22:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Probably not.
00:22:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. If you had to guess roughly how much time you spend on distributions, conversations, any part of it, that particular section of the case, what would you think that you do? I don't know. Do you be willing to do the time tracking for just two weeks? It will be really tedious, but I can help you a lot with optimizing your system if I get that information.
00:23:15 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
I really don't want to do it. I mean, I don't feel like I waste that much time.
00:23:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I don't think you waste time. It isn't about wasting time. It isn't that at all. It's about optimization. It's a completely different thing. It has nothing to do with wasting time. It's about looking for the weight. Okay, so checking email every 15 minutes. Absolutely productivity killer.
00:23:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
I don't agree with that.
00:23:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I'll tell you why. And you can tell me why and we don't have time of looking for something to choose to work on. So, like, ideally, that would be better at specific times of day. Even if it's once every hour that you're doing it, being intentional, the problem is emails to volatile, anything could come in. You have to process all of that. If you're shifting from different types of thoughts every 15 minutes, you never get into it. I'm positive. You don't waste time. I'm also positive that you could get more out of your time if you weren't shifting so often. I've yet to find an exception. You could be the exception statistically, psychologically, biologically, physiologically, that would be an extreme anomaly. So, you don't want You don't want to track time, that's fine, but what I would recommend you do is just even just writing things down or just pay attention to where your time is going, but if you want to compete with Samantha, if you want to be top dog, you're going to have to be proactive about all of your time. You could start with just asking Samantha, do you break up your tasks? You just, like, check email constantly just do whatever. It's entirely possible that she does and just analytically processes things very quickly, that she's not even consciously doing it, she just doesn't really do well. But it also doesn't mean that she couldn't be more optimized if she does constantly shift. Everyone can be. There is a, so if you're in the middle of something, doing something, let's say you're just, your brain, like, goes blank for a second, you don't want to or you just check email or there's a ding and you check email you're shifting so now you have to get in this new what is this new thing you have to process it then you might go do it but then when you return to the next type of work you have to ask yourself again okay where was I what am I doing oh yeah that time adds up it could be up to an hour or more a day of just wait where was I what am I doing is there a frequency you suggest to let me check um so it so that's why going through this type of stuff and figuring this out would would be the starting place rather than choosing a frequency arbitrarily so that I understand and and so that you're measuring for yourself um what is the necessity of a going to email to accomplish these things, and whether or not, like, so tagging email first thing in the morning, okay, distribution, settlement, or whatever types of things, right, so you could have different types of labels that you use in your mail, so that first thing in the morning, and this sounds like more work, so I'm going to give you all the processes, you find the thing that works best for you, right? But say, for example, you just have a system of green flags for anything that's distribution, first thing in the morning, if it's in your email, when you're going through distributions, that's what you're going to look at first, and what that does is immediately removes the lag time of having to reread the emails and go, wait, what was this one? Wait, what was this one? You already know because you saw the green flag, that's distributions, I'm not working on that right now, I'm working on settlements, and that's an orange flag, or something like that, so that when you keep like active, activities together, you keep your mind in a similar zone, so you're not constantly shifting back and forth and reminding yourself, what is this? What is this? What is this? That is happening all day long if you're checking your email that often and you're you're reassessing things constantly, which takes seconds, but sometimes but those just seconds add up. So if we go through this, okay, so you've got distributions, you've got settlements. So settlements, would that be the next highest priority?
00:28:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Settlements slash like negotiating.
00:28:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Now I imagine this takes up quite a bit of time throughout the week.
00:28:55 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Oh, yeah.
00:28:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Could you ballpark it like Do you feel like you spend an hour or more a day on distributions and settlements?
00:29:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Like today, I did a distribution. It probably took me like two minutes.
00:29:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:29:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Like I just had to email it to the clients. That's all I did for it.
00:29:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And just one.
00:29:18 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Yeah, because I don't have that many words.
00:29:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's going to be like hours a week, right. And same with settlements and negotiating.
00:29:25 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
No, that's more probably like. Like an hour a day, maybe.
00:29:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and. Reviewing your case list.
00:29:47 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
It's going to be the most.
00:29:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So. Let's. right down reviewing the case list. What types of things are you looking for when you look at that?
00:30:11 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Well, it's like a new case, make sure like all the initial stuff is taken care of, which could be that we found coverage as the police report been ordered, hospital records in order Clamp and reached out to The treatment being set up what what's that treatment? Um, that's yeah, that's for the new ones for like Mid treatment cases, just making sure that You know corresponding Furls are being made, making sure that if it's at a point where we need to request policy when that gets done, as a client we've reached out to, do we have something that, or like we have an MRI, make sure I review it to see if it can be demand early.
00:31:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you can demand early, is that what we said? Yeah. Okay. So like if a MRI indicates a certain kind of injury or something you can do faster and expedite it. Okay. else?
00:31:58 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
That's about it for the middle. treatment stage cases, cases that are like towards the end, making sure that if there are any referrals that the client doesn't want to get or move forward with, give them a call, try and convince them to. If not, make sure Cynthia knows to request all the records. If we're just missing like one, I might send out.
00:32:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We got this for second, I'm so sorry. Keep telling you my internet connection is unstable. What's going on? That's almost never happened. Okay, sorry. Case towards the end, can you start over from me?
00:32:44 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Yeah, see where the treatment left off. If there's a big policy and we're not at the policy point, kind of just see Why why the case is coming to an end if the client didn't want to follow through with the medical referral hold on when you say See with policies like where we're at on policy limits like what do you can you like if there's a hundred K policy, but I look at the notes and It looks like the client's kind of wrapping treatment up Oh before they hit the policy limits like before yeah, like like they they haven't treated To get the policy yet Because they're let's say it's a hundred K and you know He's only gone to pain management and no injections or scheduled things like that Probably means the client doesn't want the injections So on those I'll reach out to the client, you know try and convince them Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't And if they want to close out and make sure send your requests all the medical records If we have like three out of four facilities, I'll just go ahead and send a demand with that.
00:34:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what was that last thing? I'm still running out.
00:34:11 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Sorry. If we have a majority of the records, I'll just submit a demand with those.
00:34:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so you don't demand anything until they're done with treatment and have been taking care of within with the policy will handle. That depends.
00:34:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
You know, sometimes if it's like. There's 15 K on the third party, and I know the client's been recommended injection. I'll demand it right there, even though he has like a hundred on his side. Because I can get the 15 while he's still treating. That's the thing. make sure the health insurance lien has been requested and then you know depending on the client you know based on my experience with them thus far if they really need you I'll let him know hey you know this is where we're at with the case this is what I'm gonna do next so I might make a call or a text there I guess the next category would be like cases in negotiations see where the last offer was left off if you just call see if you know why they're not able to get to the number we're at Um, why they were not able to get to the number right, I think that I'm offering or I'm okay.
00:36:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, negotiations is about your attorney fees.
00:36:22 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
No, this is settlement.
00:36:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So with the insurance companies, or, okay.
00:36:28 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Yeah.
00:36:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so this would be about policy limits. Or no.
00:36:36 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Uh, it could be policy limits. This is like pre us. Pre settlement, so I'm trying to get to a settlement.
00:36:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Just trying to make sure that. I want to understand a neph of the process too, because one of The things that we're going to get to is figuring out how much of this stuff you do, how much of it is done by anybody else on your team. Really want to understand more about the process and the nuance of it. So the mechanics of it, we don't get into too much with with Mark and love for getting through some stuff. But but even being able to understand that better will also help me figure out how to lend support and kind of optimize what's happening, which ultimately is more profitable for everybody to move on. Okay, so where we weren't able to get to the number we want for settlement.
00:37:36 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Okay, what else? If it's like at a standstill, you know, ask the client to write a statement. Now we've been doing the second voice, so I'll, you know, reach out to someone to second voice it. Sometimes it includes if the number is a fair number and they're, you know, Max out and the client's the one that's not willing to accept Try and convince the client that To go to offer and they should accept it Often do you think that happens?
00:38:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm-hmm not much Right now I just have one All right, what else in negotiations That's basically it okay, and then distributions We're gonna do settled cases so once it's settled there's still some stuff to do You
00:39:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Get the release, which is basically the formal agreement that, you know, works up in the settlement. Again, negotiating with the doctors for their. I would that part of we don't do we have a department for that.
00:39:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The department. And inside a sweet lot.
00:39:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Yeah.
00:39:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who does that.
00:39:38 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Oscar.
00:39:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I'm just curious about just understanding that where does Oscar. What are his other functions or is that it.
00:40:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
He does that, he helps with distributions. There's some more stuff I'm not sure, maybe marketing here and there.
00:40:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that too, but I know I've heard his name before. Okay, I gotta look Oscar up later. All right, so you don't have to do that. That's good because that sounds tedious as crap. What do you need to go sharing with the clients, the doctors, and they're like, basically, if I give up my fees, it's so you can make your fees.
00:40:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
seems like a tug-of-war that just would suck. The only thing that we do is we send Oscar the numbers.
00:40:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. Then what?
00:40:59 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
If it's. There's you I am to go after prepare that for.
00:41:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's you I am under insured motorist coverage.
00:41:09 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
So you first have to get the third party settlement. You have to get their policy limits before you're able to demand for the U.
00:41:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am. I believe that is enough for myself. Because if they have it that they're not uninsured right to see you've checked that first is that the whole. Underinsured yeah. Oh underinsured okay not uninsured uninsured means that they don't have insurance and we're just dealing with the client insurance from the start right so when you say you I am it was under insured.
00:41:55 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Underinsured yeah technically meaning you know we got their policy limits and it's still not in.
00:42:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have to cover it therefore they were under and true of it. Okay. Where am I Go. Okay. There's you. am go after that.
00:42:22 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
And then. And then. I guess the next category would be like distribution.
00:42:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, are you one that does most of that on your team or all of it?
00:42:47 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
I do all of it.
00:42:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so we talked about how much time is just not a lot the way. I mean, cases take a long time. You've got like 140 cases or something somewhere around there. And I know how many of you think that you do a month on average right now, knowing that that number is changing and increasing? I mean, what distributions will you work on in a month?
00:43:26 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
And I guess I So this month so far, I've got one, two, four, five, six, seven. I was going to say roughly 15 at the moment, we'll just move on.
00:44:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, oops. Here. So would you be interested in asking Samantha to show you kind of like her. Like, does she have any system? Does she have any sort sheets where she, like, how does she organize things and just look at her and see. And it may not be anything you want to do, right? Just because that's her process doesn't mean that's the way that you would work. But since you've already been asking her questions and What I think is, so the way that I figure out my systems is almost by triangulating. I get information from different people, I never copy anybody's system because nothing works best for me. There's nuance to everyone and that really should be the process. I'll give you some feedback. You can get some stuff from Samantha, you can ask other people but ultimately the best system is going to be one that you've custom made. There are things that all of us are adverse to for different reasons and it doesn't matter if the only reason we're adverse to it is because we just don't like it, we don't want to do it. What you have to figure out is what creates the most friction and drag and what creates the the best, the smoothest effort, right? And there are multiple things that will do that. drag can just be you don't like it, like you don't like reading books. It's not that you don't like learning, but you don't read books, right? We all have different ways that we we function and do things. So then but then sometimes what will happen is what we may like less is not being the last not getting the the cases done that we want to get, not making the amount of money that we want to make. And so, and this is one of those things where they say people make changes when the pain of staying the same is more than the pain of change. So if the only way to be the top dog and sweet law was to read books. And month after month after month and obviously that is not the way that that would work. I can't Think of a better example, we think about anything else. But we'll just say that that's what it was. If you knew without a doubt that the only way to be top dog and sweet law was to read books, I think you'd read the book. Eventually, you'd just be like, this sucks, this sucks, this sucks. I know that that's the thing, so why would we do that? Now that's not the thing. But what will be the thing will be your processes, will be how you organize your time and how you utilize your resources, because you have fixed resources. You're not going to get a whole big team to do other things if you can't manage your resource as well. 100%, the way to win, the game that you want to win to get the most amount of money, the highest payout to be top dog in the firm. If that's the main thing, I would think earning the money would be the main thing and doing it really well. So those are tied things, right? Because you're not, I don't think you're the type of person and be like, I want to make all the money to help with everybody else. already know that that's not the case, right? So it's got to be a crossover type of rule. So figuring out how to create a system that works, that doesn't annoy you, doesn't piss you off, doesn't feel tedious, will be the thing. But one of the things you I want you to just kind of keep in the back of your mind is, you may want to, it may behoove you to be less annoyed about certain types of things. It may not. This is all theoretical at the moment, things to consider. is there any activity that you do now, food that you eat, anything that you do because you know it gets you what you want, but you used to hate it. And now you don't because it gets you what you want. Can you think of any example like that in your life?
00:49:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Oh, chicken reps.
00:49:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I actually have to eat that at three, and I'm already thinking about it. Yeah, and so let's be a little bit more detailed. What was this specific thing that Chicken Frost does for you?
00:49:21 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Yeah, it's really big and strong.
00:49:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And protein levels are hard to get, huh?
00:49:27 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Yeah.
00:49:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. why chicken out of any other protein?
00:49:33 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Um, stelliness, you know, gets you where you need to be with the least amount of comms, I guess.
00:49:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So, um, it was a tradeoff, something you wanted more than not eating, boring, old chicken breast. Right? So, at some point, there may be some chicken breast you got to eat every day. If so, this to the thing I want you to really think about. And I know what you're driven towards. But if you're going to be top dogs, lean and mean, right, in sweet law, then what's your protein here? It's going to be using your time the most strategically every day. But if you don't know what is the most important thing, and if you're just going to email and reacting to whatever's there, I guarantee you that that's just it's not cutting it. I mean, it could be, we call it P protein. It could be salmon with all the extra fat like all day long. It could be like high fat beef. I don't know, but it's not optimized. It comes with cost. It comes with side effects that you don't want. Yes, you're working consistently throughout the day. And yes, you're probably making calculations on the fly about what you should do. But it it's still reactive. So going through and looking at these things and kind of triaging your activities throughout the day and throughout the week is going to, and I don't, there is no perfect way to do that, but being intentional about that is the first part of the strategy and it's the first thing that kind of will unlock things. So we know this Samantha is really smart about how she does things. I would recommend just go ahead and ask her, hey, do you have a system for like ranking? you like, what does your day look like? I would ask her, like what does your day look like? Is it the same every day? Do you have a rhythm? you have a routine? What does that look like? And how did you arrive there? Did you used to just like check email all the time and what was that like? I would like really ask lots of questions around where she is now, where she used to be, what the difference was as that happened. Um, and maybe you can ask other people. I don't know. I don't think that there's anybody else to model knowing what I know about you and sweet law. Mark's MO is very different. Um, being, you know, the business owner. What he does on cases and because he works them so little like I don't think he's he's the most optimized at that because he's doing all kinds of other things. So that's not a good model. Um, you're not doing litigation. So not Nick. Lorenz doesn't have the pace and he's not really the one to model after right now. And who else we have? Hank is new. So Samantha's Samantha's the girl plus she saw dog anyway.
00:52:49 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
So. Yeah, no, I've talked to her before and she's given me some, like I used to come in and like do demands in the mornings because when I started here, that's all I was doing. Mm hmm. And then she told me like she will do it towards the end of the day because there's usually less phone calls, the adjusters are already gone. So it's like if you can reach the adjuster in the morning, use that time to do your negotiating and stuff like that. And then by the end of the day, it's like the demands are so like chilling mode for me. Like I can just sit there and do them and it's kind of like a break. So I started doing those like at the end of the day too.
00:53:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so you're already recognizing a rhythm that you have and of the task and you okay, what else do you know like is there anything else that you kind of tend to select specific times of day to do. like how is it so far already?
00:54:02 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Sorry let's do like adjust your phone calls and stuff like once as soon as I get into like 2pm ish. It's like sometimes they're on mountain time Eastern time so that's like usually the cut off file reviews to like around like 2pm we'll just go through how long does adjust their conversations take how much time do you think you spend week say like maybe 10 hours I don't know
00:55:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that would be like averaging two hours a day. Does that seem fall-parkish? Yeah. All right. What about far review? Specific time of day and roughly how long is there a specific time of day that you tend to do that more?
00:55:27 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Like after 2 p.m. I'd say like 3.30 to 5 is like 5.30 is like demand time. Sometimes you may not have a demand to write. So it's just like extra far review or sometimes I'll just reach out to clients like big ones just to kind of talk to them a little bit.
00:55:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
On a 5-bit one.
00:55:57 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Like usually 100k plus.
00:56:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many of those do you think you have right now?
00:56:10 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
That'd be 10.
00:56:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, I shared this with you. These notes are bad. The order is not great. This will start to improve its structure over time. Would you be willing to, through the week, just kind of observe what you think your schedule is? I would love for you to do one thing this week and maybe next week as well. Check email once per hour instead of every 15 minutes and see.
00:56:55 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
I don't think it's every 15. I'm just giving a number like sometimes if I'm writing a demand. an hour goes by and I don't check it but I do check it pretty frequently.
00:57:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so at the very least though, I'm being more specific about it. Maybe every hour and it may even get to every two hours or after specific chunks of time. So if you're in a transition mode already, that makes sense to be able to check emo, right? So if you did distributions and you've completed it, there's nothing to do that day and these aren't very long so that's probably not a good one but let's say settlements and negotiating. Let's say you've knocked that out. Okay, this is a shift period, now I'm going to go to a different type of activity. Checking email just to see if there's anything that already falls within your priority list, right? Needs to be done, needs to be responded to, that's a good. So using email as a transition time intentionally or specific slots of the day where you're going to it, looking for... things according to your order of priority. And then marking them and flagging them in some way, keeping a very simple system, Patrick, I'm telling you, very simple system of using the built-in flagging system, right, in the emails for colors so that you can just glance at that. you already read it once. You don't have to read it twice. If I put this flag on, I know it's ready for distribution. I know it's ready for settlement. I know it's, let's say, mid-treatment. There's usually about four flags, yellow, orange, red, blue, so maybe five flags. if you just have some assignments, then what you'll do, it's only few minutes a day, but it's more than that. It's in you can do. So you're going to make yourself a little bit more potent for specific applications. activities because you had to do less of it in email. So once you've identified what the email is because you read it, flag it. And when it's not in that thing anymore, change the flag color, or remove it completely. It's a tiny little thing. This is gonna be chicken. I'm telling you right now. This is chicken breast. It's, it will make a difference. It's annoying, but it will stop being annoying pretty quickly. Once you do it regularly, it I have no other way to explain it to you other than, you know, over two decades and hundreds of people that I've been working with. It's the simple little thing. So if that doesn't work, I don't know how else you could organizing that, but organizing email to a degree. Now, there's a way bigger way to do it, where you could create folders, drag everything into this, blah, blah, That's, that's a pain in the . Using the built-in flag. system. It's right click on the email and you choose a color. Eventually you'll remember what the color I think you'll do it very quickly. That will help. So that's what I would like you just to consider. I don't want you to half- it so if you're not going to do it don't do it. If you're going to do it stick with it and I really want you to consider it to be like chicken breast. Give it a little while if you're going to do it. And then the other thing is just really try to even if you just make some notes okay this is how I spent my time just a little bit for a week. Any amount of really specific information the fact that I asked you how long you spent on time you're like I don't know rough idea ballpark. If you want to play high level if you want to be top dog if you want to get the most out of get these cases done more efficiently knowing where your time goes. He is 100% the key to unlocking that, so you just have to decide if that's the thing that you really want to do. So ponder that for me, and we'll, so we have group talk next week. I'd be interested to see how Lawrence goes through his day too. And again, it's just kind of a slow and steady process, and you'll think new thoughts every week, and you'll gain a little bit more knowledge and gain a little bit more experience that we keep moving it forward. But these are the leverage points. So anyway, thoughts, questions, comments, annoyances.
01:01:47 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
No, I guess I never really like broke down. You know, what I spend my time on, like day by day.
01:01:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me ask you this, when you go to the gym, do you have a routine?
01:02:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Sometimes I'll make it up as I'm going, but it's like a certain body part in that day.
01:02:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. And do you ever just not do a certain body part by ever just completely neglect any muscle group?
01:02:18 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
No, never.
01:02:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So even though you're going and you may not have a routine, a workout routine, you mentally are calculating, I've got to do these muscles. I've got it like upper, middle, lower, you're thinking about everything that has to be done and you're thinking about even subconsciously the fact that you've got to create some balance. Like, you know, if you don't work, if you've worked the front of your muscles, but not the back of your muscles, you create imbalances, you know that, right? Like if you work your quads and not your hamstrings, you're going to have hip issues. There are things that we're doing constantly, and some of It is just because we've been doing it so long, but this you haven't been doing so long. And so you're there are some things that you can learn about why you do it. So I don't know what kind of results you get at the gym, but just kind of think about this. Like that is the area where you spend the most time on what makes you happy. And what is it that but so the thing that I know that you're going for is is we'll say be and talk about like you want to be the best attorney at Sweet Law. That is not going to come from just showing up and grinding. That comes from strategy. So that's the thing that's a little kind of bug I want to plant in your head to think about that and really just kind of breaking it down and understanding what does what. So you understand that there's different types of protein. You understand that there's different types of training to do. Everything gets us different types of results. That's what I want you to think about how you show up to work. The way that we do things matters and specific results are going to come from specific types of effort.
01:04:29 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
So just two lunches to work every day. First one is beef.
01:04:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
second one is chicken.
01:04:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Yeah, chicken and they have turned in. I put it off because I don't want to eat it.
01:04:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
See and now I would eat the chicken first. So I just like it's done and then I would savor the beef later and be like that so that I get to look forward to it because I like doing that with my energy. I want to knock the crap out first and then get to the good stuff for the rest of the day. Yeah, but that's the thing though, understanding how you tick what what makes you work. So and then also sometimes asking yourself, but does it work better for me that way? What would happen if I knocked it out instead of going stupid chicken for more hours, right? And just go now while you only got away for two or three hours, eat the chicken. Chicken's gone. I get beef legs.
01:05:29 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
Have it a bad day. then I got to hit the chicken now.
01:05:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm even worse day. Yeah, right. So there's a book called eat that frog. I've never read it, but it's basically about do the hard thing as soon as possible so that you're not mentally being dragged down by the stuff that has to happen. Get the hard stuff done so that you can coast for the rest of the day. But it really isn't about coasting. It's because even if you want to like play hard, you're not diminished by the human. feeling resistance like I don't want to do it. So think about what where resistance shows up and you know how much you want to let it have power over you.
01:06:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)
So when someone asks you if you want the good news or bad news first you always take the bat.
01:06:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Always always always always because if they tell me the good news first I can't appreciate it because I want to know what the bad news is. I won't even be in that moment. The pain is coming. Shut the up and give me the pain. I watch the needle going in if I get shocked. I want give me the pain first. So I'm done with it every time. Every time because I want to be fully present for anything I get to enjoy. If I have to eat broccoli but I get cake I will throw up eating all the stupid broccoli and then don't talk to me. be until I'm done with it. And then when I'm eating my cake cup also because I want to be fully present, don't talk to me. Just let me eat my cake. And I'm going to really enjoy it. But I'm really, really, really conscious and intentional when it comes to energy. So, like, anything that has to happen. So, if I go get waxed, right? If the girl is talking to me, I'm like, you need to stop talking for a sec, because I need to focus. If I can breathe, it doesn't hurt me that bad. If she's talking, then I'm just like, I'm flinching and that stuff, but I can breathe through it. So, yeah, that's just something to think about. noticed like, you're young, you've got lots to learn still, and you've got through military, so you've got some different experiences. play around a little bit with things. things with routine and figure out what gets you better results. It's not so much about what you like better because that's going to be clouded by what you're experiencing at the moment. Ask yourself what gets you better results at the end of the day, wherever you can reduce stress and friction and most stress and pain comes from anticipation and people don't take that into account on that. That's why I choose what I choose first because I understand the anticipation is the pain. It's not just eating the chicken is the fact that you're sitting there thinking about it all that time. That is real distress in our minds and our bodies. It literally could pump cortisol into you just thinking about the stupid chicken. And then, but there could be literal endorphins and dopamine coming from you get the beef. Also because it's the vitamins. make a load way above chicken. Those B vitamins and steak and beef, if I'm in a really bad mood, I almost always don't eat beef because I don't digest it well. But if I can't figure out my mood, no matter what, if I go eat a steak, those B vitamins. Oh, through the roof. B12B6. I know those ones, I don't know about what else. B2B2. Yeah, it's good stuff. So think about those things, play around and just kind of observe them. And it doesn't always have to be the same, but be conscious about what you're choosing for yourself. And think about the thing that might be draining you a little bit because you're anticipating something you don't want. Knock it out. Yeah, I got chicken waiting for me. I'll tell you what though, and they may even happier than hate that saying something.
01:10:04 - Patrick Shahverdian (5)

I'm pretty quick hearing, he knows. How's your week going? What's going on? I don't think I actually sent you over log in information for BBD.
00:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nope.
00:00:14 - Chandelle Hay
Here, I'll send it to you right now. So that you're getting his ads. I know. But you so I'm sure you've noticed and I'm sure you know this strategy. Anyway, he's basically picked a different piece of the program and created an opt in for you. Right.
00:00:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, oh, that's actually what I've done.
00:00:33 - Chandelle Hay
Exactly. then I just wanted you to see how he's got it laid out inside of the membership section because it's cool. And it's easy. Where? How can I find log in to you? Okay. I'm so like has anything else come up for you then in the law because we went to the shooting range this weekend a couple We went Saturday and we went Monday. Nice. What's a holiday there, right?
00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Hold on. I'm pretty sure I have your phone number, but I can just send it to messenger. But hold on, me stand out. You do have it. Let me.
00:01:22 - Chandelle Hay
You want me to put this into chat for you?
00:01:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Would you mind emailing it?
00:01:29 - Chandelle Hay
I'll do it right now. Hi Jay.
00:01:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hello. This is me and the three girls and the text messages. Look at our targets. Here, maybe you can, I don't know, you can't really see.
00:01:47 - Chandelle Hay
that's so fun. Are you good at shooting?
00:01:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, yeah, but it. Every gun is different. Some of the sites, like one of them, I think the site is really off. And then it like the nine millimeters, they have way more kick in it. So like I have to really focus on holding my wrist strong. But I've got a rifle and that thing is so smooth and they're zero cake and the accuracy. And my kids are a little scary because they're like, pop, pop, pop, pop out. It's a semi automatic. But nine millers, they have, they have kick. And they weren't scared. They didn't flinch at all. And I just like, it took me forever to be able to be used to that. And like, they weren't intimidated. Like, you have to start by chambering around. And or if there was a, I have a bread and nine millimeter and it keeps what's the word jamming. And it's kind of intimidating. Like the first time you do it and you have to like drop the clip and open it up and like hope it doesn't blow up in your face.
00:02:58 - Chandelle Hay
And I've never
00:03:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They were yeah, they were amazing. I have I have two three pistols and a rifle and we have bows which I've taken them all bow shooting before And they want to go out again. So anyway, we had fun. So I didn't get much work done. That's okay. Today's Wednesday But I have been working with chat GPT and foro is amazing. I love watching it go memory updated and And how it's updating across the chats Because I have one that's around the book and one that's around my TikTok marketing strategy and Sometimes I'm just like I don't really know where to put this. So I'm like remind me that I Want to include and I'll tell a little story. Yeah, and so Then I said when I need you to remind me all the things that I told you to remind me I want you to give me an outline. Let's try a sample of that and it spits out all the things I told it I want to remember but it will also suggest where that content should be inserted.
00:04:06 - Chandelle Hay
Really?
00:04:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it will tell me my different foundational principles where that story relates to and sometimes it relates to different things so it's really been amazing. Yeah so I've also been looking at TikTok marketing strategies for a year really but I'm really starting to dial into it and the more that I study stuff the more I realize that and we all know this but that old is new and new is old like that's the whole reason why my stuff works is because it's timeless foundational principles. Yeah so the people on you know the influencers are like well people are really wanting long copy now and long videos and the platforms are going into long content. It's because shiny is over. Yeah. Realized that 60 second clips are frying their brains and they want more content and they can't get connected and they finally just got sick of the dope.
00:05:15 - Chandelle Hay
Yeah. It's so flashy.
00:05:17 - Jason Orban
It just flips flops airflops all the time.
00:05:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
does but what doesn't flip flop is there is always an undercurrent of stability in the foundational principles which is I've never changed how I talk. I've never changed what I say and it's always been attractive to enough of an audience to have a happy, healthy business. So you can get surges of revenue from trends and tapping into the algorithms but if that's an overwhelming, consuming type of thing which often for parents who don't have a lot of time and having to learn the trends takes its own amount of time. and just showing up consistently and doing the thing that you do is going to be right. But anyway, so creating content, organizing it, using chat to get that out and then studying the marketing campaigns and watching Jay post things and going do it. You have great hooks and you have great offers, but I just feel like it is so subtle compared to what the great I don't think you're you're posting has looks nearly as powerful as what you do. You guys are amazing in the results that you get. You're amazing to work with. And I just don't think it stands out from the noise very well. think that if you create or graphics for those posts instead of doing the like the background colors. Yeah, just you know, had some graphics to rotate throughout. I'm sure you would probably like making. I'm Jay, but we've probably outsourced them really easily. But I just feel like there's just so much noise for organic social content. If you're not doing a boosted post, and even if you are, it really needs to be more attention grabbing. Like the words are that they're not highlighted, you know, for the ADHD type that is like just scroll, scroll, it doesn't evoke emotion, like reading something that's bulleted on that word that you want to see that you care about, right? Whether it's restaurants or salons, that's a word that I need to slow my scroll if it's about that. Or if it's, you know, the remind me what it is, the review thing, the like power tools, for instance.
00:07:54 - Chandelle Hay
Yeah.
00:07:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Right. Right. But so the other thing about loyalty and rewards is it's not it doesn't evoke enough of a clear idea as to what the power and the benefit is what your power is is the virality is that the word of the way that it works right it is a it's kind of a dopamine machine it's like go do this and this happens yeah versus here's a card with the code here's a punch card right there's no comparison to what you built versus what they automatically think of a loyalty rewards cards it's like my it's my friend Meyer card you know yeah which you know okay whatever basically just means I get to in store discount but you overcharge me anyway so it means nothing it means I have to play the thing but what you guys have created is powerful it's it's getting in front of it's your people getting you in front of other people where they're at and using technology in such a way that it's hyperactive. And hyperactive loyalty rewards, just that word right there might change the way that they feel because we have an attachment to that word. It immediately evokes a sense of like, I feel hyperactive.
00:09:27 - Chandelle Hay
I hear that like, what's hyperactive? I know what that is. That's got one kid in school that always got in trouble.
00:09:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got how I feel after I have my caffeine. You know what I mean? Like it evokes something out of the norm. Hyperactive by definition is not normal. Yeah. by themselves are normal. So I'm just thinking like, I just feel like everything that you guys do is so low key in terms of presenting, but it is not low key in terms of
00:10:00 - Chandelle Hay
terms of what results you get. Yeah, but you know we were just talking about that this morning. We've got tons of videos of people saying like this has changed my life. Like you guys are amazing.
00:10:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is like so like a little video clip of those going all those moments.
00:10:19 - Jason Orban
Yeah, that's what we were talking about this morning.
00:10:21 - Chandelle Hay
We need to do stuff like that. And so I've been starting to learn more things like that as well. Yeah.
00:10:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:10:29 - Chandelle Hay
And then I think like the stickiness, the stickiness of you know a business starting a program like a loyalty rewards program. It's sticky. It's not going to go. It's not something that people are going to take away. I think really focusing on that too is a really big.
00:10:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You should do it for coaches and consultants because so many times. I spit out my gum. Hold on. Sorry. Um, because you know I remember contest domination and all the other ones like it.
00:10:58 - Chandelle Hay
And they are crazy, but they're. hard to set up.
00:11:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're frustrating to set up and most people don't want to do it. And I am very technically inclined. I edit PHP pages and I still hate setting those things up. you know, API keys are easier to set up. They're more into it now. And that's usually part of something that has to happen, right? Is you have to go and you set up multiple API keys for the different types of things where you're trying to capture them as an email dress or or as a Facebook follower. So like you've got all the API keys for all the different platforms that you have to set for contesting. If you have a service where it's connecting to all of their platforms and maybe you walk them through what it's like to go get the API and you show them really well. I don't know if you need it for your thing or if you had a service where they could just pass you through LastPass or something secure on account or something like that. the thing is that coaches and consultants Oftentimes are really good at what they do and if what they do is not marketing or building websites or running apps and they being in the business know how many snakes they're on the business are. And a lot of times they just don't run business well so they don't have a lot of wiggle room in their profits if there's anything that you could call profits it's all you know pretty much break even for a lot of them. If you can show them hey this is the thing that you can plug into like I know you have an existing fan base or you wouldn't have a business. So this plugs into your existing fan base and lets your fans go give something fun away to their friends for you that helps me grow my business and here's a reward for you. It's like that right yeah so but in that particular that that. opens up a whole new ball game, especially of people who are already working online who already have some familiarity. So the friction points versus salons and restaurants, there's a lot of people, salon owners that have no clue how to use anything technical. They're like, yeah, I have an account I've never logged in. I've had an account for five years. I logged in once, you know, things like that. And I know, and restaurant stores are probably even less, except for there's that one oddball that's a techie that somehow also got into food. You know, whereas coaches and consultants probably got their start online because that's where they discovered they could even do it, and it became possible. So the pools should be much bigger of people who are, they should be less customer service in that stuff. You know what I mean? Anyway, and and I I would be a customer and that's kind of how I go off of a lot of things. There's a lot of things I'm not the ideal customer for but a beginning coach and and I even hate I never think of myself as a coach I think of myself as a consultant but I get called coach a lot whatever it's a it's a most of that is because I need to control the language and the branding. I need to like I would never have a sales team. I wouldn't say never I finally met a female sales team because the energy and the representation and knowing that you're not selling something I'm not promising. There's a lot of opportunity when it comes to marketing to misrepresent a brand and to sell somebody and sell the provider. Into fulfilling something they don't want to fulfill. Yes anxiety. So Marketing is a big deal. And if you have a tool Especially that allows the existing community and fan base to Go feed the community and fan base, but be rewarded for it That's powerful those things exist, but they're not marketed I can't even remember the last time I saw one of the contests things going And Like the contest things for what like though kind of like the viral up viral type that yeah, yes And if they're being promoted they're not being promoted well and not to the average You know six figure barely making six figure under seven figure could be multiple six figures They're not getting marketed to that stuff Yeah, because there's no conversation about it anytime I bring it up to any of my clients. They're like, oh yeah, I think I've heard of that. Like, there is no high level of awareness. You look at how Gene Schwartz talks about marketing and markets level of awareness, there's none, which means that's largely untapped still. I used the first one like 12 years ago, and I almost never see it still. I see I have a few people who are asking me for it.
00:16:34 - Jason Orban
Yeah, so I've been saying that we'll get that done. Yeah, I've got to do that.
00:16:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you guys are like financially you're hitting your what you need, right? month you just want to grow or are you not hitting what you need?
00:16:56 - Chandelle Hay
We're not. It's like it's Honestly, stressful, the way that it is right now, we never know what's coming in, right? it's, it's super dodgy, like full transparency this week, we need to bring in like enough money to cover our bills, like that's where we're at. There's no buffer.
00:17:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so you definitely have to get tighter on marketing. So what is the, what is the offer, Jay, that you have had taken the most?
00:17:34 - Jason Orban
When we do a, when we do a discount on our Power Tools bundle for 11, 11, that's probably where most people have taken us up on things. We up the price of our Loyalty Rewards 997, but haven't had anybody buy in the last like month and a half, two months, that one specifically, they've been buying a couple People have been buying power tools or signing up for our monthly like the $150 a month, which is not bad. It's just not fast. Um, and then yeah, probably when we do the lifetime things for about a thousand bucks, then people jump on that.
00:18:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, how does customer service work is any of it?
00:18:26 - Jason Orban
Um, not too bad. Like it can be there's periods, definitely where we go through, um, things being a little more, um, more busy with, um, supporting everyone, but I do a Tuesday and Thursday support call for an hour, hour and a half each day. And, um, people get a lot of questions answered there.
00:18:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And do you like that?
00:18:55 - Jason Orban
That's okay with you. Yeah, that's fine. That's cut down that, that our or every couple of days is not a big deal, hour and a half, sometimes it goes to like two hours, but that's better than having four hours of meetings a day with everybody wanting to talk about things on their own.
00:19:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The thing that I am noticing is that everybody's got their hands in your pockets. Everybody's got subscription, you know, and the credit card percentages are going up crazy. People getting nickel and dimes to death. So it doesn't matter how valuable something is, they have to take into account what they can afford to come out on a monthly basis. So if you have a subscription-based model, to me, wherever you can find it to be profitable and balance that minimal attrition rate, where they're staying, the thing that you would have to do is to continue to resell them, and that's anything that you do. if you want to mitigate refunds and then cancellations.
00:20:07 - Jason Orban
Yeah, we haven't been too bad with cancellations and refunds like last month. We had a couple, but it was like weird weird weird thing. There was a lady from December who bought something and decided that she hadn't used it so she wanted to refund. And we're like, okay.
00:20:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you don't wear your shoes, you get to get a refund.
00:20:27 - Jason Orban
Right. And you know what I mean?
00:20:29 - Chandelle Hay
No, I know.
00:20:29 - Jason Orban
It was, it was, um, but, um, then we had, then we had somebody who purchased it. And then I was having tech issues jumping on a call with them. And then they were like, I want to refund. And I was like, I was like two minutes late for the call. Okay, have your, have your damn refund. Um, because other than that, like it's rather than that.
00:20:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's it. That's, that's, that's. how many active subscribers do you have?
00:20:56 - Jason Orban
Um, let's take a look right now. Right now we've got about seven thousand. Recurring coming in from subscriptions $7,000 not 7,000 subscriptions I was like wait because I said how many people and I was like, oh, know it's about $7,000 month recurring. I got to go to subscriptions and see How many subscribers we actually have Will it just give me a list of all the subscribers?
00:21:24 - Chandelle Hay
Stripe is really hard to pull reporting out. I know that I've looked and I've actually I have some months I keep a spreadsheet and every single day I mark down Like the reoccurring payments so that we can see our cash flow as well throughout the month I haven't done that for this month though Because it tells me that Um, let's see here to do You But I one question I wanted to ask was like let's just say you had whatever. 50 people paying $100 a month.
00:22:04 - Jason Orban
It says we have 53 subscribers.
00:22:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice. 50 subscribers paying between $69 and $150 a month. Okay. That's good. Because what it means is you obviously have a viable offer.
00:22:21 - Chandelle Hay
We do.
00:22:22 - Jason Orban
Oh, yeah. No, for sure.
00:22:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We do.
00:22:26 - Jason Orban
It's just, yeah, definitely getting it out there and getting in front of people more. So we've been doing more, doing more workshops, talking about stuff. We're doing the launch lab because I, because I know there's people who buy the LTD stuff, but we can't have a sustainable business off of selling those, those things for those lifetime deal for things because then they buy once and then they're like, thanks.
00:22:48 - Chandelle Hay
you later. Unless we're in front of more people and convert more people into that model.
00:22:56 - Jason Orban
of people don't want a monthly payment. Like that has come. Yeah.
00:23:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, with the service, a lot of people will never use it. Like, um, yeah, what's his name? Josh Bartlett. What does he have? Thrive cart. How many people have to have have a cart, but never use it?
00:23:14 - Jason Orban
Because I've got so many people who purchased from us and never know aren't using it. Yeah, you know, that's something to think about.
00:23:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's two things.
00:23:24 - Chandelle Hay
What were you going to ask? Well, I wanted to ask like, let's just say you added another 100 people paying monthly, right? So then let's just say of 150 people paying monthly for power tools. That's $30,000 month right there. Would you then maybe have a daily support call? One hour a day where people can just maybe it's different times. You got people in the in the in Australia and whatever. Maybe you need to do like act so that you're not doing more one-on-one tax support. Like,
00:24:00 - Jason Orban
That would be the way I could see you could scale that and being able to have we would have we would definitely have a couple people helping us out with tech support to answer questions and just like kind of like support live chat.
00:24:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We would actually let that happen and hire that person.
00:24:20 - Jason Orban
Yeah, we would hire that person and have that person rolling just answer questions and they could be on call 24 seven or not 27 but you know between business hours answering questions. I've got a you know one of my masterminds I've got a there's a guy who does that he has a lady or someone out of Jamaica that just sits on zoom all day and answers questions.
00:24:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look at my cup.
00:24:43 - Chandelle Hay
Can you see it.
00:24:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's from a friend and a past client I've had that lives in Jamaica and she sent me these earrings. sent me some paprika and spices and chocolate. You said you make it up like.
00:25:01 - Jason Orban
I feel like we've added about 10 subscribers, 10 or 12 subscribers in the last month.
00:25:10 - Chandelle Hay
Yeah, and I've been running ads and they seem to be bringing in good quality leads. I also think like another thing that we talked about this morning is that so Jason's time is a lot of demos like he's doing a lot of sales calls demo type things, but we're actually not following up with those people. So unless they buy that day, they're just put onto our list and then they get like all the same emails that everybody else gets. So today I'm going to go through his calendar and come up with like a list of all the people he's given demos to and we're going to look at like how many of those bought right away and then we're going to create like a pipeline that those people have put into when they're like I need to go talk to my team and I'll get back to you. We're not following up. like we're not.
00:26:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you want? Okay, so let's come up with this simplest system that we know is also the most leveraged. So in person is most leveraged because you can kind of like talk to people and sell them and persuade them on the personality, answer the questions, but it's not the most leverage in terms of time, but you like it. So what if for one month you did a live demo on a schedule every day of the week, except like a particular day, like maybe five, five days a week or four days a week or something like that. Maybe one day it's a couple times and then there's also a live replay. So anybody who wants instant access can get it and you end up picking whichever one is your best demo that ends up getting switched out. So if today you have a better demo than your last best one, you update that. So they're really is actual live, hardly anybody's doing this in any time, but nobody's doing it in here. So they have access to a real person where they can ask real questions. And like Shando, you could be available on chat support where they could talk to you. And so they could have a breakout room where you can ask questions. And Jay could just stay, you know, going on or could ask questions live, depending on what type of questions some people don't necessarily, you know, want to ask everything in front of everybody.
00:27:31 - Chandelle Hay
That's the thing that we're finding, right?
00:27:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're doing it live every single day. And you can stream like the first few minutes to Facebook, to TikTok, to Instagram, to YouTube. But the only way they get to stay is if they opt in, the stream stops. And the stream needs to stop right at a point where you're like, and this is the actual power tool where they can get enough to start salivating and go wait, wait,
00:28:00 - Chandelle Hay
Wait, wait, wait. What's next? Yeah.
00:28:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then you're like, um, if you want to see the rest of us, just send, you know, opt in here or click this link or whatever. And that link is a webinar, opt in page where they can immediately get access, but they do have to put in their email address. And, um, you know, make it one of those that validates an email address immediately. So you're need a powerful follow-up sequence. And I prefer to do, and of course it does create friction, but you, when you're looking for a subscriber, you need to qualify the lead. Otherwise, you're, you know, you're going to have higher refund rates, cancellations, things like that. So you want to qualify them. So some friction in the beginning means more lubrication in the end. So you ask a survey question, you know, what, whatever the things are you need to know, which is what's your what are you making, what are your problems, but obviously really efficient and you don't want to ask too many questions. And you also wanted to have single step, which means the form submits and captures everything that they've done, even if it's incomplete, you get an incomplete form, because some information is better than none. So if they answered the first two questions, but didn't answer the next seven, you still know something about what they need and something about them where you can submit them and go okay, you said you have this issue, here's why this solution works for you. You said you have this issue, and I've already done the algorithms and the calculating to know that if this of these seven things I asked are your issue, if you have this one, this one is the most important, so I'm going to give you this information and tell you that it will also address this, this, this, this. So there's some logic that has to get built out, but it can get built out really quickly quickly with chat GBT and your experience. You are already know what most people have issues with when it comes to, you know, either as building a website, is it tracking? Is it being able to build a sales page or get the sales page to connect with the CRM? Like there's different components that people struggle with and knowing kind of what secondary categories and tertiary categories. So let me talk to you mostly about this but remind you that this and this is getting taken care of. But you want to do it succinctly because people don't have large attention spans and you want to show them how easy it is and how you're going to make it easy every step of the way by some great training that is clearly labeled. Like this is where you go for this. And this is how long it's going to take you and you'll be up and running an X amount of time that up and running an X amount of time is a hook that has sold me, but it's hardly ever used, hardly ever used. I'm telling people how fast they can get to the thing that has been holding them back. And speaking to them about the fact that they haven't been doing what they know they're supposed to do in their business, because they didn't have the system is going to hit them like a ton of bricks because, like, you know it you have not been marketing the way you know you want to and you know you wouldn't be in this situation.
00:31:41 - Chandelle Hay
If you were marketing the way you're supposed to, right?
00:31:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So if somebody came in and said, I'm going to kick in the and I'm going get you to do that one thing and by you know in two weeks from now, you're going to have a solid marketing campaign up and running the one you know you should have had like eight months ago, you're going my money.
00:32:00 - Jason Orban
I've had a bunch of conversations like that, that's, and that's, and that's where people have been asking me to put together the coaching program to talk, to coach them through getting their clients in high level. And that's, and that's, and that's a big thing of reason why we're launching the launch lab there. I follow up with a few people today. They're excited. They're excited to join a couple people. There's still people starting out. So one guy's like, I'm just waiting for deposit to come in, whatever, you know, there are people that they're struggling. They need money. You know, so they want to join and they want to get in. They want to start selling the stuff that we have. They bought some of our stuff, but they still need the motivation and the kick and the to get going. So there's a lot of people who are in that situation where they bought tools from us. spent $500 to $1,000 already, but they still haven't done anything.
00:32:54 - Chandelle Hay
They can't, they don't, they just, they're, but it's not, it's not even if they can.
00:33:00 - Jason Orban
I'd sell, they're just not selling or they're not, they're not getting out and talking to people. not making That's why we're starting this whole that's why we started the whole launch lab thing And that's where I need to create a better video about what that talking about that specific thing because I would I just sat on another one I sat in another group that I that I know a guy that I know they just did a prospecting in sales one Almost everybody in there exact same thing to like I've had this for so long. don't know how to sell it I don't know what to say to people That kind of thing and Chan's been doing a really good job in the last week here to just reaching out low to local more local businesses And she's yeah, got four or five conversations on it go talking with local businesses about that I like that's for sure where like I got off my call yesterday and Amelia was like mom You are so good at sales calls She's like I instantly smile what because I can just turn it on and it's because I did care for so long Right but I
00:34:00 - Chandelle Hay
I think one thing that I wanted to ask for your feedback, Tina, around is we didn't launch the launch lab. That's a separate subscription and that and the idea behind that too is to give us somewhere to go.
00:34:13 - Jason Orban
Give us somewhere to go after somebody buys that lifetime deal after they buy a bunch of power tools or whatever some of our stuff where do they go next because they're not selling it. So I need to get them to the next like where they're actually selling it because we have a licensing model with it where the more they sell, we're giving a solid discount on it to go ahead and sell it. But every time they go and sell a new business on it, we make more money too, right?
00:34:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My brain is not going to be able to process what you're saying until I write with the question.
00:34:44 - Chandelle Hay
So here's where we're at though as far as pricing now. There's lots of different options for pricing and now we're adding a whole other new thing that is another subscription. And I'm trying to wrap my head around what is the clearest way Like, so lots of people do, they just sign up and they go and buy Jason's tools without even a conversation, Tina. People will just go and buy it. So I'm wondering if what part of that should be a part of Power Tools, the sales, should we be, should we combine the sales training and the running an agency and all that with this product and raise the price? Do we have an upsell when somebody purchases Power Tools say, now, right now you can join launch lab for a discounted rate as a part of Power Tools. So I think we need to do that right away. But then also, I, I message with a lot of people and I get them excited, then they get a demo and then they, then they're gone. We need to follow up with those people, but then I also wonder about the people that are full, should there be like, like a lifetime.
00:36:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't like lifetime.
00:36:05 - Chandelle Hay
I don't, I don't like lifetime or like yearly, like a yearly payment yearly is that me answer the question because there there was a lot in there. Yeah, it is.
00:36:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
First of all, first of all, I think that you should split test how the things go because I think you have an evergreen offer. And that means dialing taking the time to dial it in. But knowing that you're going to continue to have to split test, you know, either quarterly or every six months or so, because the market buying behavior changes. But for sure, I think it should be an immediate upsell. And I wonder if your demo isn't shooting you in the foot by offering it to people and overwhelming them with technical stuff when maybe they weren't ready for it. So do you just offer it to everybody or is it they ask for it? Like, how does the demo happen? And how and how technical is it?
00:37:00 - Chandelle Hay
So normally, they just send, they land on our Power Tools sales page and there's a chat widget there, and then they'll ask a question, which is, I could probably find all the, like, the top questions that are asked, right?
00:37:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have a call in at 1130, I forgot about.
00:37:20 - Chandelle Hay
Okay. And so then they ask a question, then we answer those questions, and then it normally leads to them asking if they can book a call, a demo. And then Jason, Jason does all I've never done any of those calls.
00:37:37 - Jason Orban
They're technical people who are jumping on there, and I don't get into the really, really technical stuff. We go through the, we go through the more of the user interface, how this works kind of thing. We don't get into like, here's all the workflows, and here's all this thing, and here's all that kind of thing. It's like, here's how you use it, here's how you sell it. And here's how you could use because lots of times they have, they might have a different industry they want to use. So we discussed that and we chat about how they can do that. generally leave really happy with it, they just like, they all have basically teams. I've got like three people who are like, I'm having meeting with my team tomorrow, and we're going to chat and then we'll go see what we want to do.
00:38:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Chantel said that you give people demos and then they disappear.
00:38:26 - Chandelle Hay
What do you mean? Well, a lot of them, it's busy, right? Jay will carry on with the day.
00:38:34 - Jason Orban
And then don't, there's- I wouldn't, again, so a lot is perspective or subjective. So there's a few, yeah, there's a few that we go have that conversation and walk them through things. Like the ones that typically aren't that haven't signed up after a demo is they own restaurants. and they're trying to determine what is the best way for them to go with their restaurant and they are they have a few hang-ups typically when I talk to agencies and show them it they're like this is awesome like I can sell this to my clients no problem I can get them using it right the ones where I've had the that they kind of drop off and we they don't kind of follow up or buy I have been just restaurants themselves where they're like I own a restaurant and they've got like a group of guys or there's like three people on the call and they're trying to figure out a loyalty system they can integrate the problem that they have and probably the most loyalty programs have is they don't integrate directly with their point of sale system because lot of is locked down so so so yeah then they're just like damn it other one we can right maybe you shouldn't be targeted in them at the moment while you know we're not we're not targeting them they're just coming in through high level because there's lots of people using high level who are in there so they see our stuff they reach out we're posting a lot in the groups and we are we do get inquiries from that.
00:40:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So maybe we can just like maybe you guys just don't think about them too much for a month so maybe you have like a 30-day sprint where you're really focused on building out a marketing campaign as though it were your clients, tree, big studios, whatever you're doing right now as though it was your client you would make the graphics you would have strong call to actions you would have the USP right you would say this is why to buy from this this is your hook like all those things that you know that have to do with getting attention capturing attention justifying the cost, all those things like and it's being done in a visually powerful way with a powerful follow-up sequence, all the things that you would do for another client because you have to or they don't keep paying you, right? You're amazing at getting them new customers. You need to employ those things. But if you're doing it for 30 days, a leverage starting maybe next week, I'm showing up every day to do a live demo Q&A and you can get a replay if you want to but if you want to show up live, we're answering your questions and how you can implement this today, how you can get your first sale this week, how you can start to get your investment back this week. Now you have to be really careful about claims because the FTC, I don't know if you can reach into Canada, I don't know how that works and if you make sales through America and I don't know what your country has for what Canada has for compliance, in claims, and things like that. But just use the language of can, might people have whatever, what's possible, not probable of that type of thing, or just these are the actual results that you can prove, person like you did this, did this, this, whatever. But I think it's just getting in people's faces for 30 days on every platform, repurposing on every platform with a very strong call to action, very strong U.S. peak as lots of people are doing high level stuff, but you definitely have very unique stuff.
00:42:44 - Jason Orban
And that you're really focusing on the fact that there are a lot of ADD people out there. they said it the other day, she, her and her husband, went through our five day challenge that we did, or 21 day challenge back in March, and they loved it. What? What they said they're doing and she like she like this. They're working on building out their high level system What they want to do and their product they put this this is what she said. We're doing what you guys told us and productizing our system For an each and I think that's was a good.
00:43:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I haven't thought of it that way, but I mean, that's what we've been doing Yes, that's what I wanted to do with high level and I don't have the time on the team for it But that's the opportunity that it gives by having snapshots where you can build for what you do and just in sorry You have one snapshot.
00:43:35 - Chandelle Hay
You now have a product.
00:43:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you know, and you now have an affiliate offer with high level Plus a snapshot, you know, and then ongoing service or I'll create a new snapshot every quarter for you instead of every month, right? Yeah, outsource the upwork like there can be a whole system of in your launch thing Yeah, it's crazy like there's so much so it should be an immediate upsell and it should be bang bang bang here is the opportunity and if you just do this like you want to bullet point the minimum effort that they have to make if you will just do x the odds are that you're going to make a sale within x period if you you know post to instagram every day and you're telling why this thing is so good and we'll tell you how to tell it why like in a non-ducy way just you were telling your neighbor dude this lawn mower is amazing it does this this this this this you highlight all the features all the functions plus i only got it for this price like this is what we do this is a human this is like i'm gonna tell my neighbor about this thing right so just make sure the neighbor actually cares about like he he he doesn't have escrow turf because he doesn't want to hear about your lawn mower you know but
00:45:00 - Jason Orban
Yeah.
00:45:01 - Chandelle Hay
So, and then do you think all of those sales tools and scripts and pitch decks and sales training, it's okay to have that inside of a different program?
00:45:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, what do you mean?
00:45:17 - Chandelle Hay
you've got launch lab and that's what all of that is going to be, right? it's office hours are today 12, bring what you've got a proposal you need to make will give you a template for that. You're writing social media.
00:45:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We'll give you an outline for that.
00:45:31 - Chandelle Hay
We'll give you everything you need yourself. Yeah, that is okay in a separate program or should it be a part of power tools?
00:45:40 - Jason Orban
No, no, no, no, I'm trying to combine too much everybody going into the store that wants to buy a blast.
00:45:47 - Chandelle Hay
Does everybody want to pair it with the skirt?
00:45:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:45:51 - Chandelle Hay
Okay. Some people do.
00:45:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I want to pair it with the pair of shoes or purse.
00:45:56 - Chandelle Hay
No, but some people do. Okay. I just feel like I'm so stuck.
00:46:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
on that one detail. Okay, why? Why do you think because that was going to come up and other things?
00:46:07 - Chandelle Hay
I just think trying to create a marketing plan around all these different things is getting it's not because they're all related.
00:46:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So all that you want to do is you want to show how it's linear or almost like a like a flow chart and you should create a flow chart, Jay, this would be perfect because a business is a marketing ecosystem. People like you have this core product like high level is a core product that works for restaurant owners that works for social media influencers that works for salon owners and all that other stuff, right? So they can come in from all these different places. And on top of that, so you've got email list management, you have email list helps. you've got just the functionality of being able to catch or any more address. But then you also need the functionality of segmenting if you take this action. If you open my emails, I want you in my opens. If you came in on this, you only open emails about this topic, I want to segment you and tag you with this. So there's a tagging function. Then there's, can you print some of the information from the form onto a dynamic web page that says, Hey, first name, your order information is this. Here's your login. Like there's all these function and features people don't even realize are there that important, right? So you've got the technical people in your ecosystem. You've got the novice users in your ecosystem. But what you know about all of them is they need to make money. They need to take money. They need to manage and own as much of their everything that they can't write their list, their web page, their websites. If they can have it all in house for getting about the fact that high level is Frankenstein code. that's whatever. It's still under one login roof, right?
00:48:05 - Chandelle Hay
And I mean, it's crazy.
00:48:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's growing so quickly. And then the fact that they have snapshots where they can be fed in and maybe you be a snapshot curator. Maybe you don't just build them. Maybe you go curate and white label other people's snapshots that are for certain stuff. Maybe they can white label and curate other snapshots. Like, this is brand new. That's one thing that high level has done that nobody else has done, which is these snapshots, basically, insertable, fundable, ClickFunnels might have done it. I never heard of it. I didn't get in their world. But the thing is that high level people are hyperactive marketers. They smoke ClickFunnels people, which is probably why they're trying to see them like dumbasses. Go slap a kid through high level in the same year.
00:48:59 - Chandelle Hay
Good job.
00:49:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
oh poor guy uh yeah that's that's not how i and then just the affiliate model itself for high level like i like it's it's insane and so Jason when he first built that first snapshot he was like give people the shovel sell that we're selling the shovel but selling the shovel and i'm like okay yeah they don't know how to sell the shovel so now we're like we need to teach them how to sell the shovel yeah i gotta wrap up in like three minutes so i've got a four minutes beforehand but yes you should do the multiple offers and you should see how people respond to them they'll behave differently learn what you can learn about them sell the shovel but you don't need them this is what people need to learn they need to start to learn how to evaluate things better so what people generally are focused on is i got to make a million dollars by the end of the year or i have 10,000 this year no the first thing that you need to do is get your money back back from this current investment. So you're bleeding a little bit less. The fastest way to make this be free for you is to go sell it to one or two people.
00:50:09 - Chandelle Hay
can do it.
00:50:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You need to calm yourself down a little bit because 10x is easier than 2x, right? So if you go sell two, your very first two customers are going to be the hardest ones to sell. After you sell two, you've got some experience under your belt, then you go and you sell more. So look, I just want you to go get your first sell. I don't want to talk about anything else except your first sell, if, and this is a self-selecting survey, where do you follow this? Do you need this investment to be returned to you ASAP? Are financial distress? Okay, if you're not in financial distress and you're at least paycheck to paycheck, know, living across, but then here's what your focus should be. It should be, what is the most optimal offer that you can get out to get out of the rut that you're in right now? out, that doesn't create time, energy, overwhelm that so that you'll be able to maintain it. Okay, if you're profitable and you're looking to optimize or just capitalize on an additional type of offer opportunity, whatever, then, you know, you're not at the bottom of Maslow's hierarchy over here starving, I can talk to you about self actualization.
00:51:24 - Chandelle Hay
Yeah, that's right.
00:51:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's right. That doesn't get talked about out of marketing, but in every market, that's what you have, you have somebody at the bottom who is just trying to buy, and you have somebody at the top like, I got everything, but I got more in me.
00:51:39 - Chandelle Hay
So what else can I do? Right, right. That's a really good way to put it.
00:51:45 - Jason Orban
Oh, Tina. So, okay.
00:51:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So having said that, I just need to know if Jay thinks it was worth showing up to talk to me.
00:51:54 - Jason Orban
absolutely. I just, yeah, like, I've been sitting here listening and I just hold a guy on $250 for 2k. Talk to you with another person for $1,500. Dave said he's good to go for $1,697. Nice.
00:52:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or he wants to look, well, is what we do, right?
00:52:18 - Chandelle Hay
And I said this morning, like, this is what we need to do this week.
00:52:21 - Jason Orban
We need to sell like . He just asked if he can have until June 3rd to get the special on five licenses.
00:52:27 - Chandelle Hay
Because I told him if he signed up before the end of the month, then I'd give him five licenses instead of three. Yeah.
00:52:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. So give him like a timer at like midnight.
00:52:37 - Jason Orban
So here's what I want to see. I would love to see. And then somebody else just signed up for our fall today, too.
00:52:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Bam. Two fifth. So okay. You guys should come up with a marketing action plan, like very clear offers.
00:52:52 - Chandelle Hay
Get on the same page. Shandale, stop being scared.
00:52:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Trust Jay, when it comes to the offers and Jay, she needs you. to actually document and commit to the plan, whatever it is, and to be clear on it so that you guys can be on the same page and that she know how to support you because I know that that dynamic between the two of you and I probably am a hybrid of both of you.
00:53:19 - Jason Orban
June 3rd is Monday, yeah.
00:53:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So when I'm operating from where Shendell is, I can't move if I don't know what I need to know and I cannot move at all if the one I'm working with and my partner, if I have uncertainty and and no clarity about are you showing up? Are you doing this thing? Is it all taken care of? And you can't tell me yes, you have to tell me how and like visually my brain works. Yes, if you don't tell me how because historically anybody that just will say yes and not show me how, doesn't actually have a plan, means they're full of , means that you know. Oh, next week is going to be the same. So I'm just telling you, like, if you want her to stop bugging you. Because I'm also Jay. In the like, I'm doing these things. Get off me. I got it.
00:54:18 - Chandelle Hay
Let's go more the lawn. Like, I'll just go look for the lawn and wash the car and pull weeds instead for the day, right?
00:54:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I'll just check out. And I don't want to. I want to kill this thing. So I would love if I could pick your guys's brains and I can wait until next week. But I mean, COVID just destroyed people like so many things have been done. And I've just been taking care of them and I just want to take care of them. Some people just can't. I have no problem being able to make money, but I have to make money at a whole new level that I ever have before. So what was a very great life for me now when I'm giving in the way is like, it's okay, but I need it's time to accelerate. right? And so I am in new territory. I've never had to grow at a specific pace. You know, I've always like, I can make almost $200,000 working less than 10 hours a week, easily. But now I need to make, you know, quadruple that so that I can just take care of people dying of cancer, Oh, Tina, being homes. You know, like I people do all that they can, but right now that's just not enough for a lot of people. So I've got to come up with a marketing engine and I can make money. I can make money in my sleep. I just don't have the system. I can do it for everybody else. I am doing it for me, but I draw energy and clarity from other people's brains and that affirmation. And I need that energy to be supercharged. And when I'm supercharged, I fly. But the situation for some Some people right now are such that I can't help fast enough. And so I need to get my together, but I'm also being mom and a single mom. And I'm about to launch my third child out of the nest. that's a lot of getting them graduated, getting them money for getting on the job, getting them in college, making sure that they're also having all that experience of transitioning, having the freedom, taking the road trips, all of that.
00:56:25 - Chandelle Hay
That's a lot of stuff.
00:56:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So any help that I get from power brains that no marketing, but especially YouTube, because you know the value of what I teach, so you can kind of feed that back to me and go, Tina, on this, this and this. Because my biggest thing is focus fast enough and effective enough to, I got to get these people taken care of.
00:56:51 - Chandelle Hay
Well, do you want to jump on to your next call and then let me know if you want to meet again tomorrow and talk about your stuff, we can do that. or if you want to just meet with me on Friday, we could jam and just come up with one thing you're going to enter the universe here with and get it moving.
00:57:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Friday, I'm going to the temple and tomorrow I have, hold on a second because this is one weird week in that I prioritize some personal things that will do the filling up on my cup.
00:57:29 - Chandelle Hay
So tomorrow. Which is good, that's good.
00:57:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And tomorrow my dad is graduating.
00:57:34 - Chandelle Hay
Okay, so then next week. But in the meantime, any ideas like send it?
00:57:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like any thoughts, I need to send it. We can do the audio thing because that was really helpful to me. I got to jump off. And also, Jay, I know you're super busy but you think differently and any kind of feedback. Like if you do, if audio messages are too much for you or whatever. But maybe a call, but I would really be grateful for, because even the technical implementation. I will go.
00:58:09 - Jason Orban
I love you guys. Yeah.
00:58:12 - Chandelle Hay
you don't need to just do us together.
00:58:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like you can call me. know I did that.
00:58:16 - Chandelle Hay
You can call me. Like even just start a chat with Jay up just you and Jay, because you're right. He will have completely different insights and ideas than I do.
00:58:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to hug you and speak to that. Nah. I love you guys so much. going to go.
00:58:31 - Jason Orban

I want to set up a new computer and I have to everything's changed since the last time I've done it. Oh, good. Thank you.
00:01:24 - mark sweet
Yeah, sorry, I'm trying to get caught up on a couple of things I had America puts you other list of all the doctors that we've kind of worked with over the last year or so and then sort of put that in a map so that way we can start planning doctor trips basically. Nice. You really see about three to five people. It's true just more than that I can see a little bit too crazy.
00:01:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

Yeah, I'm always quiet.
00:02:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so even this looks different. If I didn't change, did it? Okay. Okay. It looks different.
00:02:57 - mark sweet
Might just be the view. There's a way to change on the different view.
00:03:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is the view not set by user?
00:03:08 - mark sweet
Yeah, but I don't know if I had to change around an octave and plan around with some AI implementation stuff.
00:03:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I don't know how to get to where I want to go.
00:03:26 - mark sweet
Do you want to share a screen and then?
00:03:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Oh, . I did not know what happened here. I mean, I guess it's fine, but, uh, where's screen share? Seriously, everything looks different. That's tough. Even that's like, it's not showing me which thing I'm sharing. I've got to see if this is the right one allows you to open some some settings. Sorry, I've got. All these things to set up. Can you see my screen?
00:04:11 - mark sweet
Nope.
00:04:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. Let's try this again. Oh, that's why. It's not going to let me do it unless I quit it and reopen it.
00:04:32 - mark sweet
Got it.
00:04:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry. So I can tell you what I can't. I need to screen share. Hi, Dan. you good? I'm going to do this quiet today.
00:04:50 - mark sweet
I don't hear anything, Dan. I heard it. You did, but I don't hear anything.
00:04:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Listen up.
00:04:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I hear it.
00:05:00 - mark sweet
Yeah, Dan has arrived.
00:05:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dan did the accidental video last week. He was like, how do I turn this off? I have that same situation today. Only I didn't know. We should just do video one day and actually see each other. I do video with my, my lady friends. Sorry, that's James loud. Okay. I can't. I don't want to end the call, but I can't see little. So maybe somebody else in screen. Sure. We can go over numbers that way because I, hey, Dan, can you log in the little fire and see if it looks different to you? Because you have this in the log and I use.
00:05:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Different. Different. Different. What's different?
00:05:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, the layout. I don't know how to navigate to the reports.
00:05:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I want. Okay. Let me see.
00:06:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see, I didn't think that's one. Let's scroll down.
00:06:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Hello. Working on it.
00:06:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I don't have I mean, no, it doesn't look like this. Okay, so I used to see at the top all these different menus, and one of them was reports, and one of them was dashboards, or maybe dashboards was under reports, but for the whole long list of things that are not there anymore.
00:07:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
more. Yeah, I mean, I see them as normal.
00:07:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Why would I not see them?
00:07:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And you're logged in as Lauren?
00:07:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is the only one that there is.
00:07:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:07:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it can't screen share because I haven't set up zoom permission yet on this laptop. And it won't let me do it unless I turn it off and back on. So Anyway, sorry for wasting time. Can somebody, can we look at our numbers?
00:07:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's somebody me because I'm on my phone so I can switch to my laptop.
00:07:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think Mark's in the office.
00:07:42 - mark sweet
Yeah. I gave mine just my nose. That's little different.
00:07:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. You don't have the same dashboard that we do?
00:07:47 - mark sweet
I don't know anyone.
00:07:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Alrighty.
00:07:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't worry. Monday Monday.
00:07:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Indeed.
00:08:00 - mark sweet
You want to make me host?
00:08:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Wait, that should automatically allow multiple participants. You should be able to just share.
00:08:15 - mark sweet
Oh, yeah.
00:08:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, I have that setting. If you need to make it a bit bigger than me. Like, zoom completely looks different on this laptop. it's still a Mac, so I'm just not expecting all these changes. Okay, and take Swiss or Swiss State. All right. Oh, so let me get back to my notes while I'm a second, which is also different. I'm going to show a contributor. Teamwork. Sorry, teamwork is now on here, too. So to go through some of my stuff. Uh-uh. It did actually start this 10 minutes early to be prepared. I just didn't know I was going to need more than that. I apologize, sweetheart.
00:09:35 - mark sweet
It's usually a little bit of a tip.
00:09:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's that?
00:09:40 - mark sweet
This is the other one that we tend to look at.
00:09:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I mean, it's looking good. It's the 17th. It looks better than it has at this point in the month for the last several months.
00:09:56 - mark sweet
Yeah, but there's usually a week slow down.
00:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know if it's going to be this week, next week.
00:09:59 - mark sweet
Right. Right. Right. Right. But it is what it is, quantify seems to be a pretty big success, the only problem is they really can't scale.
00:10:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what is the ceiling, what's the cap, like, if they can do that?
00:10:20 - mark sweet
the next year, like, maybe 20%. So it was another like two to three needs per state, it wasn't a lot. Well, at least they're being honest. Right. No, you're not wrong, you're not wrong.
00:10:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is something. Oh, sorry.
00:10:42 - mark sweet
The cost per acquisition is pretty solid with it. We'll keep that going. wish I had two or three more of them, obviously, but it is what it is.
00:10:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is their cost per acquisition?
00:10:56 - mark sweet
3500, I have the exact number somewhere, but it's around there. So, yeah, about half what monkey is, yeah, but monkeys are the best attorney's fees. So we're going to keep monkey on again. The biggest issues on Felipe, their costs and their average attorney fees very close to each other. So the $300 difference doesn't make any sense. You've got to feed the beast at some level, but if you talk to them, I had them full, basically, from Washington because it's just not working. We go state by state to put more money into New Mexico and Arizona, which should help. Because they're doing well in Arizona in New Mexico, but doing really poorly in Washington.
00:11:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, my gosh. I saw another sweet James freaking billboard. I don't like how that guy looked. You saw a sweet change billboard? Yes, because I'm in Arizona.
00:12:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I'm only like an hour and a half away from Lauren's right now. Oh, that makes sense.
00:12:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:12:15 - mark sweet
Inks and Phoenix.
00:12:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, he's in Phoenix?
00:12:19 - mark sweet
Hank.
00:12:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, Hank. Yeah. Yeah.
00:12:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know.
00:12:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm I'm in Tempe. Oh, yes. You're close. Yeah. Yep.
00:12:32 - mark sweet
So you are near where we're stuck here.
00:12:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was in Gilbert Saturday.
00:12:41 - mark sweet
I went to the temple. A of C physical medicine.
00:12:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was in Chandler this morning.
00:12:48 - mark sweet
They're like. Like. So I had America put this together where we've sent a lot of. Cases too. So we're trying to plan trips.
00:12:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that.
00:13:00 - mark sweet
It's lot easier to go from here to here than like here to here.
00:13:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. That's really smart.
00:13:08 - mark sweet
So we'll show up with that together.
00:13:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look at the big brain from you. Yes, let's not do that or fall down any stairs at parties either. It's supposed to laugh. No, they laughed. Come on. We don't remember this story. Listen, if you guys are going to be this boring on a Monday, I'm going to leave.
00:13:42 - mark sweet
Wow.
00:13:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here I am now. Entertain me. Come on. All right. So also just not being on my normal computer. It's very disruptive to my brain. So let me go back to now. Right. Our sources. So let's go down the source. Let's real quick, um. After math, we still don't engage that's gone now, right?
00:14:21 - mark sweet
Yeah. I mean, that's just the chat on the website. think that really was much of anything.
00:14:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so do you have any other potential? What do call those vendors? Talk to you. And what is your process like for? Do you do you set aside a day, a week, a month, whatever to go look for some things? Like how are you coming across them? Um, through the grapevine is an intentional. Is it as it happens?
00:14:59 - mark sweet
Some ambitious Google. playing and trying to find it and just giving them 10 grand to see what's going to happen. And again, most of these are going to fail.
00:15:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:15:08 - mark sweet
Most likely. So it's just more of that asking the after hours call center. And then obviously this HQ intake that they've worked with that have had decent results because they want more business. So it's pretty clear in that regard. Beyond that, they don't have a lot else.
00:15:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Google searches, there's not anybody that you haven't tried yet.
00:15:39 - mark sweet
The only one that I haven't tried is Quintessa. But given how often she gets sued, I don't really want to try her. So that's the only big one that we haven't.
00:15:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I was going to say there's many a fly by night of their own.
00:15:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Same. Random thought, but. So let's say there's somebody that's a newer SEO company getting attorney leads, but they're only doing it in Montana and they're small, know, so they don't think about advertising in California. What if you did a search for attorney leads in Montana to find some little thing that little, you know, agency mama pop shop who's doing a good job with that in Montana that maybe has a different kind of approach or something. I don't know, like I'm just trying to think out of the box and where we could find skill and talent that's kind of flying under the radar, but also price-wise is going to be lower. Maybe it's not possible because they're still have to be getting attention in your area with all the competition, but it's worth trying.
00:16:58 - mark sweet
I mean my own concern of course is When you go from a less competitive to a more competitive state, you generally don't do very well versus the alternative.
00:17:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:17:09 - mark sweet
if you were able to kick out some California, you'll kick out some Montana. But I think if you're looking for like New Mexico specifically, Missouri specifically, I've just been looking more generally. It may not be a bad plan to kind of do town per state.
00:17:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so can we make that a specific action item of. Looking per any of the states that you're currently in or potentially looking to be in.
00:17:41 - mark sweet
Yeah, that's a good idea. think I should do that because I'm. Pretty well, I'm on page like seven or eight at this point. So the quality is not.
00:18:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You So when will you do that so that I know when I can follow up with you about having checked it out?
00:18:06 - mark sweet
I'm probably not going to be adding a new lead source for at least the next 30 or 45 days because I want to see how quantified it's going to kind of finish out and how absurdly does since we started giving them some more money.
00:18:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, starting though and doing the research and having conversations just to know that they're there because there's a whole process. I mean, would you be not be willing to look into it first?
00:18:33 - mark sweet
Yeah, just usually processes. Okay, would you leave?
00:18:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, give me money.
00:18:38 - mark sweet
Give me money. Here we go.
00:18:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Dan, Eric, make this happen. It's literally 72 hours.
00:18:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, all right.
00:18:48 - mark sweet
It's fun to know it takes the longest period of time, so you're right though. I mean, it's been a little bit of time with that.
00:18:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and I mean, and if we could find a few quantified five who don't know how to scale but can compete at that level like getting even two to three leads for 3500 and depending on what the attorney fees on those I mean a handful of those would be amazing right no um you're absolutely right it's just finding those kind of folks right you lost a lot of money uh so far but that's okay yeah but there's there's no way we're winning without trying I think we just keep also true um and the rotation of who is the the primary you know winner monkey versus walker versus Felipe has done much better at times um the cost per vendor but also the cost per state there's so much variance and I mean it all it all You know, so the more levers we have to move, the more control we have over the movement. So, but that doesn't come. It just doesn't fall in your lap. So that's my pitch. Just let's keep at it. Okay. Let me go down here. Mark wants to know if we can have a widget made in our management dashboard that says conversion rate. Dan, do you have anything to report back on that?
00:20:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Josh hit up Stacy. was like very apologetic. guess their firm has been super busy. He's like, I've actually been working at the firm. But he said he would have all the last round of stuff done today or tomorrow.
00:20:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Cool.
00:20:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, I mean, we can send him more stuff.
00:20:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. All right. don't know. I don't think I found him. that properly. I know it's in here in recording, but I don't know how to get it to highlight yet. So, the next one was, um, status of unified beta functions. Mr.
00:21:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think we're, he's just waiting, right? Yeah, that hasn't been released.
00:21:26 - mark sweet
It hasn't been, we put in all the packages that we need to implement. so now it's just on let it find.
00:21:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:21:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, okay. intake scripts. sent something over.
00:21:51 - mark sweet
Yeah, um, I wasn't thrilled with it. Just, it wasn't thrilled. So I had Patsy kind of put together the basics of what we need, and then it was A to put his spin around it, I guess, right? If he's the best guy on the phone, having him put together script makes the most sense, right? Here's what we've had before. Here's what we're doing. I'll send you what he made, but I wasn't super happy.
00:22:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then what's the next step to get to something that you are happy with?
00:22:41 - mark sweet
We're trying to go back through it, and Patsy's been on vacation for the last five or six days.
00:22:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you know, like, I'm pretty good at this chat GPT thing and have been from the beginning, so we ever want to have the AI session on down. seriously could you like have some caffeine or something both of you gee oh my god I've been up since 430 because the certain little black somebody is not loving this cray training I'm like oh my god you know we're talking about kids you don't send me dog pictures Dan what I want to do this look into a pool this weekend you what that the pool oh there you go what into the pool the dog look look look running oh my god well he can swim right yes and he help me by the way dress super fast oh but he shook a lot oh okay hold on a second where the great training oh my gosh that lasts for like two years for me horrible until
00:24:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They're really generous already. She's a chewer already.
00:24:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Is she a lab? No, told me she's something German Shepherd.
00:24:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What's hilarious is the other German Shepherd. The first two minutes, it was like, Oh . This might not go well. She was like, and she freaked out and Denise was like legit scared. I'm like, Oh, and then it was like, all right, let's keep, keep them set. Of course, I'm, I tell them like, Hey, don't just bring the dog in the house. Don't just walk in the door with the puppy. Like we have to let her. What do they do? They just walk right in the house and be like, Oh my God. So Zinnia freaks out. And now she's like the mom follows the puppy around everywhere. Dangle toys out of her mouth to get the puppy to chase her. was like, this is great. It's like a built-in babysitter. perfect. Although she doesn't like the crate training either. can tell you that because she was all over again last night.
00:25:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, go away. Um, I'll, yeah. What was funny to me is my, my Bishan, like, she didn't like the crate, but then when the alternative was that or my girls, she was like, I'll take the crate because your kids are crazy. yeah, I feel safe here. Okay. Um, so I put that in house box. Intake. Oh, so the question, we need the legitimate answer, like the real answer, not if it's not going to be chat dbt, like, what's the next step for improving the intake script?
00:25:47 - mark sweet
I'm just going to sit down with Jose and pass it when she's back from our vacation, go through it again. We've had better scripts before. I mean, look, this is still better than what we've got right now, something new home. I sent to you guys, but It needs some simplification right now. It's just mostly you're surrounded around the questions they have to have answered, which I mean, again, it's good that everyone knows what we need to have answered. But I need a little more help on the, how you greet people and, you know, how you get into it.
00:26:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. So. Have these having a baby though, right?
00:26:26 - mark sweet
Yep.
00:26:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So she's on vacation now. She's not on my turn. And she's leaving and she's not coming back, right?
00:26:33 - mark sweet
No, she's coming back.
00:26:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Personally, I thought like.
00:26:40 - mark sweet
She's gonna for at least six months. longer.
00:26:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:26:48 - mark sweet
So we're actively looking again for a new intake manager.
00:26:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's that going?
00:26:56 - mark sweet
Not great. No, not great. A lot of ex-suite James people, but yeah.
00:27:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've seen that dude's picture, I can get it. You know how some people just look proctorial?
00:27:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I guess.
00:27:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you, somebody's actually alive.
00:27:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm going to come over and check your pulses. I'm not sure. Are you talking about the glasses?
00:27:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
are we talking about?
00:27:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. Yeah. he's not a good face person. Who is that? That's not Steve.
00:27:31 - mark sweet
James, divorce, complaint, and yeah.
00:27:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who is it? What?
00:27:38 - mark sweet
I didn't hear what you said because I was still talking about it. Sweet James, divorce, complaint.
00:27:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look it up.
00:27:44 - mark sweet
Is that your thing?
00:27:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:27:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hold on. Well, this is not an appropriate use of your time. Sweet James, divorce, complaint. I'll look it up later.
00:27:55 - mark sweet
No, it's highly entertaining.
00:27:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Enjoy.
00:28:00 - mark sweet
It's public resource. I'm not talking about anyone.
00:28:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's out there, right?
00:28:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Toby took Google something.
00:28:07 - mark sweet
That's legit. Yeah.
00:28:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will check that out later because seriously, I took a look at that and I was like, oh, not even speak to that person.
00:28:16 - mark sweet
So it doesn't matter. What we're learning is it doesn't matter. you have more money than anyone else, you win.
00:28:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Define winning.
00:28:27 - mark sweet
You get more cases. Well, I think you have three or four divorces.
00:28:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's not winning and a drug habit.
00:28:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that winning, Mark?
00:28:39 - mark sweet
For him it is, but yeah.
00:28:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh. You need to know that is not winning.
00:28:47 - mark sweet
It's fine.
00:28:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is earning and that's but that's not winning. The bill comes due, Mark.
00:28:57 - mark sweet
Look, they're doing well. I hope we keep doing well. But I would like them not to keep going in the states that I mean, because I think it's just not a very long matter of time until they're in Washington.
00:29:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dippola does a job of spreading.
00:29:09 - mark sweet
That's just what it does. Yeah, they just open up taxes so she keeps busy for a little while.
00:29:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so intake script, we're working on that. Okay, I just want to make sure we have time to get through everything.
00:29:24 - mark sweet
We got Hank going. We give him his first case. We have him mostly working on just the cases right now. It's where everyone starts. So just trying to get through some of those, which is good because it takes some of the pressure off. You know, the other attorneys because those are the ones that just take a lot of time. And not a huge great opportunity.
00:29:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So is he going to stay in Phoenix?
00:29:50 - mark sweet
Yeah, he lives in Phoenix.
00:29:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so.
00:29:54 - mark sweet
So him and Liz are in Phoenix. So the goals. Once he really understands what we do, so it's kind of started from the back end and moving. being forward. Then we'll keep building up this caseload. So we've obviously got to make sure we get plenty of Arizona cases for him and Lorenz. But Lorenz just got overlaid, just overwhelmed, it was just too many cases, too many files. he's just slow and he struggles with structure and everything else. So we need to bring someone else to help him.
00:30:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could be a training issue and Tina can help with that. Just say.
00:30:34 - mark sweet
Yeah, can I hire Tina to help train Patrick and Lorenz?
00:30:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Probably. Okay.
00:30:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me.
00:30:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes, my issue. It sounds like you could.
00:30:49 - mark sweet
Lorenz responded well to it originally, right? did what two sessions with him.
00:30:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He lit up the first call, but on the second call. Like, he hadn't stopped thinking about it. He is a perfect candidate.
00:31:08 - mark sweet
So as much as wish Sam or Tyler would do it, I just, I don't see it. I'd rather not waste money and time on them, but I think both Patrick and Lauren's are super highly trainable. So if you guys are okay with it, I think having you Tina meet with them at least once a month would make sense. Quite frankly, it takes some of the training of how to manage people off of me.
00:31:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And... Oh, I also talked to her differently.
00:31:36 - mark sweet
Yeah, that's true.
00:31:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, but the other thing is though, I have not had any success talking to anybody only once a month. Okay. It's just now there could be a difference between like meeting and talking, right? So there can be some type of team chat, whatever. or it can be text, it can be slack, whatever, to email, it can be email, but he would have to be very thorough in that and very truthful. The thing about calls, and I'll say that versus a meeting per se, because sometimes meetings are really inefficient, is that even without looking at somebody through their voice, I can hear their energy, I knew immediately Samantha was like polite in the beginning, but guarded, and Lorenz was very open. So anyway, but when people are emailing, it's less easy to interpret and to know that there's a problem, especially with people who are skilled at not revealing too much, which all attorneys have that skill, but you know what I mean? So at least every other week. And I don't know what your goals are. I don't know what the pace is.
00:33:04 - mark sweet
week is fine. mean, again, Michael's just to try to make them better for lack of better term. We're spending a lot of money on marketing, a lot of money on, you know, there are teams. So if we're able to make them more efficient, we get more money out of each case or able to more cases, that's a win.
00:33:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
attorneys, we don't get trained on how to manage people like they're still new, can train them anything.
00:33:30 - mark sweet
No, not really.
00:33:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. No, no things.
00:33:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was well, yeah, I mean, and just the results that we got with that little bit of time. But so, I mean, we could talk about it here offline, whatever, but every other week at the very least, but then we need to have weekly check ins and, you know, UVC seat on it. And included. So there's like an official kind of reporting process. I don't know, depending on what is comfortable, it's new in terms of like how I'm structured and modeling, but corporate world is not new to me. Doing the training is not new to me, I've been doing this for 28 years. So anyway, we just have to talk about like what the goals and what the structure are, but for sure once a month just isn't enough, there's too many things. After a week, people start slipping. So we could, let's just talk, because I need to think about it, but as a structure of talking on, and it could be half an hour, it doesn't have to be an hour. Like we have your whole business to go through top to bottom. We would, we'd have his, his team. So, you know, maybe the first couple of meetings are 60 to 90 minutes, and then it could probably go to half hour every other week with a structured email follow up and I have an idea of the overall goals, right? You want to have a certain level of attorney fees. You want to make sure that they're hitting targets for what do you call it? policy limits and just, I mean, I would get more information there probably than I have in a lot of our calls because he's like frontline with his team. So there are questions. I don't even know that I'd be asking right now that I would be asking. Yeah, I mean, if we, if that's time track, I would love to get them into that.
00:35:46 - mark sweet
I think that's not where we start, but yeah, I know, but they need a lot of help on how to work with their Wait, who both Lorenz and Patrick need a lot of help. I mean Patrick is really young, he's like 25. This is his first job out of law school really. So, you know, he needs a lot of help, not that it's fault in any way to shape or form. But, you know, if you say every week, every two weeks, every month, whatever you think they need, I'm four. But I want to try to straighten these team people because we're not funny, a lot better people out there, to be honest with you. So, go figure out how we can make them stronger.
00:36:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, we've been watching the hiring process with you for the last few years, so I get that. And that was a conversation we had in the beginning, too, hire B players and turn them into A players or sometimes C players and turn them into B plus players. yeah, the really, it just depends on how they do. Some people don't need a lot. And you give them a little something and they stay top of mind and they run with it. And so, We can kind of, we could come up with an ideal structure and then get some feedback going between you and me on how it's going if they need more, they need less. They need less and just build that in if you want to talk about that.
00:37:18 - mark sweet
Yeah. Dan, as a best friend, me and Tina to communicate on that or I don't know if figured that.
00:37:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
All right.
00:37:32 - mark sweet
Thanks for asking.
00:37:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Thanks for asking.
00:37:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. He's for not requiring me to do that.
00:37:37 - mark sweet
I don't want to go around people. Right?
00:37:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Sure.
00:37:40 - mark sweet
But yeah, I kind of figured you really want to be involved.
00:37:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You figured right.
00:37:46 - mark sweet
Okay.
00:37:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cool. Let's talk about the lead stuff and then I can check out of this call for the rest.
00:37:51 - mark sweet
Okay.
00:37:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cool.
00:37:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm doing the lead stuff right now.
00:37:56 - mark sweet
Yes. Yes. So. We need to change his right on loose deal that now we're getting some of those directly or that hasn't picked in yet.
00:38:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, they, they, so we, they were doing the routing. Right. We, we weren't. So Eric is talking to, I forget her name. I think what he's going to do is say, Hey, take off. This is my guess. He'll go. He'll tell her take HQ out as an email reference and then we'll handle rotating because they're not rotating at all. Right. They just were, they're just being duplicated in two places. So he can then apply a rotation to it. So it'll hit us first.
00:38:42 - mark sweet
And then he'll rotate in and out, in and out, in and Got it. Okay.
00:38:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then the other ones are done.
00:39:00 - mark sweet
Right. So the Sunday thing now is done. We're interested to see how that goes. mean, I only got one call a Sunday, but yeah.
00:39:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, yeah. And by, I mean, leads come in through the other things too. So, yeah.
00:39:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Mark, do you have any other things? Like, so you were asking about this still, like, what's on your agenda to go over today?
00:39:37 - mark sweet
We go over Rolex because that's ever certainly right.
00:39:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I just updated all their stuff. So a bunch of their stuff is ending. Not really just it just finished lastly. So there's not a lot. They got a bunch that are in and out of internal and with zoo. So probably have a better idea in the next day or two.
00:40:00 - mark sweet
Okay, I've seen a lot of the leads coming through, but I haven't seen anything of any value. So that's just why I was touching this a lot.
00:40:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. So a lot of their, I send them all the outcomes. So like I showed them and they refund. They're really good about that. So like anybody that's retained, they just refund. So I think two or three, I just updated that they already have, they were already retained. And then I send them whatever the whatever is in Littify or wherever I'm getting it from, right? So I'm either getting it from each Q sheet or I'm getting it from Littify here. But they just right now, they just have a bunch that are open. So there's nothing to really see yet.
00:40:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who is Russell? That's thirdly. Oh, okay. I'm safe to put that in my notes and teamwork, right?
00:40:55 - mark sweet
Because nobody outside of us sees that. Correct. Okay, we've been sending a ton to Morgan and and they seem to be signing up a bunch of them. So we've got paid their leads are legit, but our turn down reasons are also legit. That's sort of the interesting thing. Right.
00:41:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They're not, it's not like they got a ton of, oh, we can't get in touch with this person. It's limited no treatment gap and treatment like they're all whatever. So it makes me, I mean, I think after this round, I'll be like, hey, you guys, like, what does your form look like But they went and did the math. I was like, go show me the math of this. And they did it and they brought it back and I was like, okay, so they're, they seem like perplexed. They're like, why the you edition. could be working better. They have another guy in Washington where they're like, he's getting a better result. I go, well, you're seeing our turn down reason. So either he, either where they're signing cases that are subsequently going to get dropped, or they just signed cases in their bad lawyers, and they don't realize, hey, there's limited no treatment there, you shouldn't be signing that, which I 1000% believe could be true. But yeah, I'm like, that's the difference. You're seeing exactly why we're turning them down. They're not being turned down because they don't sound good on the phone. It's like, they are not a good fit. What like, they're not a good fit for that other firm either. They just don't know it. That's what I think might be happening.
00:42:48 - mark sweet
We'll see.
00:42:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But the math ultimately worked out in their first round. So it was like, okay, if we could keep that math. And then I told them, they didn't that they could do Spanish leads. And I was like, Oh, yeah, no, 100% Spanish. And they were like, Oh, I don't think they've ever actually really done that. So I see some Spanish leads came in. So we'll see. We'll see how those go.
00:43:13 - mark sweet
Definitely handle Spanish.
00:43:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, they were like, wait, what? go, yeah, which was surprising. I'm like, really, your other firms aren't bilingual. Okay.
00:43:23 - mark sweet
Do you have what else we could do in New Mexico? Because New Mexico is looking good for us. It's just the volume is low.
00:43:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, those guys are in New Mexico, but yeah, volume is low.
00:43:39 - mark sweet
And that just may be just the New Mexico thing.
00:43:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Just purely based off of population size.
00:43:49 - mark sweet
Although there's way more than 20 good collisions a month.
00:43:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:43:58 - mark sweet
Okay. Then you know, we've Yeah, so have we got any retainers there yet, cases? Nope. You got like two leads so far. I'm going to refer down, but that's it so far.
00:44:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
From where?
00:44:18 - mark sweet
Walker. It's a six month gap in treatment, so didn't want to screw down with it.
00:44:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:44:29 - mark sweet
But I've got three firms that I would consent stuff to there.
00:44:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Three firms you can send stuff to there in Missouri. Burns.
00:44:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They get referred out.
00:44:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:44:46 - mark sweet
I've got a place to put them if they're not for us. So at least I get some kind of money back, hopefully at some point.
00:44:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. That was, I was like, wait, are we talking doctors or?
00:44:56 - mark sweet
Okay. No, the doctor referral network is there and waiting for them to sort of send them. cases. But yeah, I'm not doing that.
00:45:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And is Monkey working on getting new leads there?
00:45:31 - mark sweet
Valium's been the main one, I want to say in New Mexico.
00:45:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I'm asking for Missouri.
00:45:38 - mark sweet
I think they said they were full.
00:45:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They do.
00:45:48 - mark sweet
But I can certainly ask them again. mean, got a decent relationship. Right. So, hey, we lost. Let me know if there's any additional volume.
00:46:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Okay. Um, is that anything Felipe can do?
00:46:11 - mark sweet
I'm trying to use them less and less to be frank with you because I just, their cost is just so high and it's just not great.
00:46:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you think there's any, do you think there's any possibility that that's different in Missouri?
00:46:32 - mark sweet
Um, I guess it's worth asking them.
00:46:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean, because you don't have to do anything that you could, you could ask all the right questions, you know. I'm a big fan of asking.
00:46:46 - mark sweet
Yeah, I'm going to text the morning.
00:46:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's see, oh yeah, I wanna write down. It's America that's building out that doctor map.
00:47:13 - mark sweet
Yeah, so we have the excel of it, now she's putting it into a map.
00:47:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that you showed it to us because I can visualize it now and it makes it so much easier to just be like, oh, okay, that's great. So when you said that ideally, well, really that your max would be like three to five visits or three to five doctors per visit, is a visit a day? Is it a week? How do you think?
00:47:50 - mark sweet
Yeah, because I really can't get through visiting more people than that in a day. Okay, give you hour, hour and a half for each doctor, plus usually at least 30 minute travel. time within each one. So, you know, I'm talking about give or take two hours and I don't want to rush necessarily.
00:48:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, right.
00:48:10 - mark sweet
Even if it's to five doctors, two hours, it's 10 hours and unfortunately sometimes it's tough to do a lot more than that.
00:48:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and also the diminishing returns of just the conversations you're going to have towards the end of the day and that could have been one of the better doctors, know, that having more energy would be better for it. know what I mean? Like there's there's probably a sweet spot in there where those are going well.
00:48:41 - mark sweet
So, five is okay. It's just when we're trying to do like seven or eight. It just it's too much crazy running around and we end up missing someone.
00:48:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, five well, then that's great. You're you're machine.
00:48:57 - mark sweet
Go out it like, you know, six in the morning.
00:49:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like it's a very long day, but it's only one day you're still young. You you have I don't but it's fine, but again, I'd rather do that than spend two or three days in the same place Okay, let's see New hires How's it going on trying to find a Seattle attorney?
00:49:27 - mark sweet
Uh, I think we might be giving up to be honest with you. Okay Because Most of our creators have said we spent way too much money trying to find one and you said no to everyone And every person we've interviewed so far has behind us So it seems like it's better for us to go and I find one of these older attorneys who for 100 bucks an hour we can just ask legal questions of just build out a person or two here so at least we'll get some of the legal brain drain that we need but we're just not finding the right person that is a strategy and it might be pretty cost-effective that's interesting you know again just we're not if we're not not finding the person and our big problem has been we don't necessarily know everything that we're doing talking to you know older slash semi-retired attorney at least he knows from the legal side yeah he's not going be as aggressive as we are whatever else but we can ask legal questions well not only that though if you establish relationship and they being local might hear through the grapevine when there is somebody that's good and then on your way like there's so many different
00:51:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
ways that can turn around something even better than just some good answers.
00:51:04 - mark sweet
Yeah, that shoots me.
00:51:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, and I think in that instance, then I would prioritize, obviously, the knowledge of the law and their willingness to just share that despite whether or not they agree with your strategy and then just the overall, I don't, it's not camaraderie. I can't, I don't know how to say it, but the openness, basically, that would allow you to establish a relationship that would be conducive to that kind of thing, you know, passing people on to you. It has to be something.
00:51:47 - mark sweet
Yeah, I don't know to build it to the law. I mean, again, they're semi-retired.
00:51:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, so you have a specific person? Right, that's true. No, no, I'm asking you. Do you have a specific person?
00:51:59 - mark sweet
Okay, that's- So they posted on the list or like, hey, I'm looking to do more mentorship. want to charge like a nominal amount in like a hundred bucks an hour. What do you guys think?
00:52:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Fascinating.
00:52:14 - mark sweet
So I'm going to chat to them and. We got emails them already.
00:52:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's that?
00:52:22 - mark sweet
I already have an email to him.
00:52:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Do you have a first name? So when I ask you, I don't want to say the guy.
00:52:30 - mark sweet
Curtin.
00:52:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What was his first name? John. Okay. Moving along.
00:52:42 - mark sweet
You know what? the Arizona.
00:52:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What might be.
00:52:47 - mark sweet
This guy, thought he was in Washington. Oh. But even still Arizona is the same idea.
00:52:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, you already have two attorneys here.
00:52:59 - mark sweet
Yeah, neither one. really knows what hell they're doing. Again, just having someone like an expert. Yeah, you can just, you know, talk to you and whatever else.
00:53:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I really like that strategy. It really speaks to more of what Dan has kept trying to push towards just leaning out, uh, out, leaning out, um, out. Yeah, I said it, but then I was thinking about like leaning to the side, but you knew what I meant anyway. Yeah. Okay, let's see. Einstein, AI, client breaking. Oh, that's, and that was the litify stuff.
00:53:47 - mark sweet
Wait, no, it wasn't. Notifies the sort of on some AI, but I still think we've got to build us out ourselves. And the reason for that is, uh, um the litify price is ridiculous oh yeah right the one like five dollars a file which is just oh yeah um so i think there's some there with Einstein uh Isaac's been out sick the last week or so oh also Isaac's been a child just FYI in November Isaac is i mean he's not the one physically but yay that's awesome congrats Isaac and is he taking paternity leave?
00:54:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
i don't know i need to ask him about that i don't think so because he's the main breadwinner but i'm not sure um so then what do we have any thoughts on how we would implement building something in house i mean it could be really minimal that's what i was hoping
00:55:00 - mark sweet
thing, maybe Dan and Josh kind of had, because I'm more than sure Josh is going to say the same thing of $5 a file is just dumb. Yeah, like there's no way they're going to pay that. And so maybe if we all kind of work on it together, we can find some of the all of us. But I would ask him like, Hey, did you see the pricing on it?
00:55:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Because I'm sure he has.
00:55:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, well, that's a start. So Dan, do you want to ask Josh about it? Mark, do you want to email Josh and Dan and like, how do we get this to move?
00:55:44 - mark sweet
don't really communicate with him too much. So I'll be better for Dan.
00:55:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dan, do you need a reminder for this? Nope. Okay, so the notes that I have regarding Einstein AI was client ranking, so I want to just make sure that I don't want to direct something wrong. So what would we want to be doing with the AI?
00:56:39 - mark sweet
So what we found solidified built out was taking a scan document and renaming it, being able to pull in information with their visual AI, whatever they're calling it. Einstein AI should be able to do the same thing, which again, is taking from scan to pull up and client name, data service, the data incident, the amount, and then being able to put that and create the fields within our data.
00:57:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, Dan, I am Kinging Stacey for a task for you with that information that Mark just gave.
00:57:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Don't up at 4 a.m. on Mondays anymore, okay? Okay. Well, now I'm talking to Eric about these themes.
00:57:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. forgot it was a doggy thing. Hopefully that gets regulated. Think couple months some Warren G out there to regulate All right Case that's good.
00:58:14 - mark sweet
So the money is gonna be here very shortly. So yay. it's great. Happy Upset about that But now it gets you tax planning yay.
00:58:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh Oh, yeah, Dan.
00:58:30 - mark sweet
Can I pay Tina for like a year ahead of time or six months at a time so I can take more money off Oh I can run that by my account especially if you pay especially wait how do I get ambax points off that when we can think of that? Yeah, I mean it might count shortly Okay, yeah, no that all makes sense Yep, I'm all for the em exponents make it make sense. That's all I say. I don't even know So for discount for paying up front, that's right.
00:59:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You wouldn't go in anyway. Oh, speaking of paying up front, why am I not charging you for lead flowy?
00:59:08 - mark sweet
Does anyone know this?
00:59:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Um, I was like, I'm like, what? Can you see not been paying for this this entire time?
00:59:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It stays as like, no, don't you have our fees integrated in? So I don't know how that happens.
00:59:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, everything is separate. Okay. like multiple everything. I'm the worst bookkeeper ever.
00:59:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Literally everything.
00:59:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Everything is online.
00:59:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know.
00:59:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. Um, yeah.
00:59:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean, that would be so let me go.
00:59:50 - mark sweet
So I mean, you charge 41 grand since June 1st.
00:59:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cool.
00:59:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What? Wait, um, Well, yeah, that's because I that's because I am ex you I chart. Have absurdly charged me and then I charge you one.
01:00:09 - mark sweet
That was a 25 grand, right?
01:00:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes, that's me fouring points and then I I have the SEO company charge me and then I charge you No, I'm cool.
01:00:22 - mark sweet

01:00:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. so I just everything everything except No, even Tina Tina charges me and I charge you so yeah Within three days of each other Yeah, so the fourth out one of the four thousands is the Google my business guys got it one's us I mean Stacy Denver, but they're definitely the actual Yeah, they are the act what they're actually for is in there just not what you're saying Because your peeps are always like where's the blah blah blah to send whatever they want.
01:01:01 - mark sweet
Got it. Okay, no, as long as it's legit, because usually when I see like back to back like a question mark, but no, as long as it's good, we're good.
01:01:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's legit.
01:01:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's legit.
01:01:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And can it quit to quit?
01:01:15 - mark sweet
Another not quick, because it seems to generally work. So then, Dan, you and I need to find the time to talk to the hot people, because that's going to keep going on for a little while.
01:01:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I don't even really know what they do.
01:01:30 - mark sweet
So, yes. Okay.
01:01:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Let's put them over a barrel.
01:01:36 - mark sweet
I'm cool with that.
01:01:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:01:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, like Thursdays.
01:01:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Thursdays. Target a Thursday.
01:01:44 - mark sweet
Yeah.
01:01:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. I'll tell you, I'll look at my calendar that I don't use, and then tell you what my openings Don't be this Thursday because I got to cook for the office this Thursday again.
01:01:54 - mark sweet
Yeah, maybe pictures of that. It's just barbecue day.
01:02:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. And by cook, is this you opening take up barbecue from somewhere else and putting it on the grill and then putting it on a plate or is there going to be raw food involved?
01:02:10 - mark sweet
Virtually probably because now we have to like sit there and cook on one small grill.
01:02:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Mark's going to be like, I slaved over these are three day baked baked baked beans. I've been, I soaked the beans first, then I'd get out my amens.
01:02:22 - mark sweet
system we picked each and every one.
01:02:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yep.
01:02:24 - mark sweet
I grew these in my backyard.
01:02:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
All organic.
01:02:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like a Korean barbecue, Mark's going around with all these lungs.
01:02:35 - mark sweet
No, they want the Mexican stuff. want carne asada, oh yes.
01:02:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll probably cook some of it the night before and just reheat the next day. Yum. Well, I think I had a good breakfast or I'd be hungry and mad at you guys now.
01:02:54 - mark sweet
But it's always a matter of the general rule of thumb.
01:03:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
accurate.
01:03:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see, Dan wants Mark to get Patsy's hub valiant to show us inside. Oh, husband. Oh, yeah. My shorthand size. Uh, how's that? Um, can we? Patsy's husband.
01:03:23 - mark sweet
I always forget his name. It's Mary's, but that's okay.
01:03:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
01:03:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
My bad. Mary's somebody's husband.
01:03:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Mary has, what's his name?
01:03:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Don't know.
01:03:34 - mark sweet
Uh, Devin.
01:03:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Valiant. Oh, yes. In parentheses, I know, but I need all the different anchors in my brain so I can not combine things together to show us what he does. So who's trying to talk to him?
01:03:54 - mark sweet
Are you trying to talk to him, Dan? I just sent him a message, but Dan, no more, be under the hood.
01:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, What?
01:04:00 - mark sweet
Dan wants to be under the hood what he's doing.
01:04:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
he's making it work, which. Right. I mean, Dan getting sneak peeks at things is how Dan does like some crazy magic. So that would be cool. OK, I've gone through my list. We got that one task, everything else. And you're going to work on the intake script with those guys.
01:04:31 - mark sweet
I sent to you. Take a look at it. mean, maybe I'm being too harsh.
01:04:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, yeah, I mean, I just listened to the calls. And it was like the my takeaway from listening to the call was like, oh, my God, they waste so much time not. It's like it's like it's two things. The first section is like, should I even be on this call? Then it goes into a script, right? So it's almost like the. There's just like this qualification question or three that then would that then would turn into more of like what you were getting at where they're the rapport and the bump of fire, whatever. But I mean, I listened to a handful of calls and I was like, Oh my God, they're eight minutes in and the person's just recapping the accident that subsequently turned out. There was no injury. It's like, you got to get that out of the way up for impossible. Or it wasn't a car or it was like not even a car accident, right? There's a few of those.
01:05:33 - mark sweet
was like, Oh, yeah, was playing this. Uh, said tomorrow the one came today asked about Thursday. We'll find a time.
01:05:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay.
01:05:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so I have a question though. Yeah, you said you listened to calls. Did Mark send us calls or did you listen? Because I would love to hear how that goes.
01:05:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, you can. I can get you. They're in the lead flow. You can just go and listen to them.
01:06:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I spent six years at a call center, so learning how to kind of craft that with something that I spent a lot of time on. How can I get into lead flowing into this?
01:06:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, I'll add you as a user.
01:06:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, cool. Do you need a reminder?
01:06:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, I'm thinking, I don't know, I don't know if you, have you seen, have you used the new thing?
01:06:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have the paid chat, GPT, Tina?
01:06:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Doug.
01:06:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
As soon as it was optional, yeah.
01:06:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay, so have you used the thing where you create your own agent, so whenever?
01:06:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think I've created one, was playing with it, but I'm, no, I've played with the agents, but not.
01:06:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So now, yeah, there's like a new section where you could go in and like create an agent. Yeah, so I was, I messed with it with Eric and we created. So basically for lead flow, like some of the stuff that we did recently, you have to use these custom JavaScript elements and it was like. Okay, well we need to write JavaScript and then I was like, well, we could just make an agent that writes a JavaScript for us, right? And so first we had Chachi indeed just write JavaScript and it totally worked, like right out of the gate. We just had to figure out how to present it in the workflow or whatever, but ultimately the code was worked. We just had to tweak like two things. So now we've created this, the implementation there is what's called vanilla JavaScript. So it's like not using outside libraries. It's like straight JavaScript. So we created a vanilla JavaScript agent that we now just use. So all it does is work with us on JavaScript. So you could create an agent in GPT and call it like literally like an intake, legal intake agent. And it can listen to recordings that we could feed recordings into it and say, Hey, here's these recordings and then start to ask your questions like what and tell it what the goal is right and then see how are these calls line up against that goal or something like that that could be interesting yeah private server though right there's the turning client privilege issues are they a client yet there's a turning client privilege issues okay it's it's a self-contained yeah it's like your gpt or the account holder's gpt so it would be like if tina built it in her it would be in her gpt it's not publicly accessible okay so it basically has the same kind of privacy as like litify does it's on their server but you know it's it's protected by privacy laws in the same kind of way okay but first of almost just listen to calls.
01:09:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, for sure.
01:09:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Because the other thing is you could just take the transcript and be like, Hey, here are the, it would just be interesting to be able to know like, what is similar about the first three minutes of these calls without, right? It's like, are they, I don't know, find the same old table, like, what are the patterns? You can find the patterns, then you can deal with the patterns or, or, or overcome whatever. Yeah, I'll get, I'll get to your user and then you can just go start. You basically just sort by time and then you can listen to like the calls that have some bulk and then you get an idea.
01:09:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got it. I'll probably have questions too before I start listening. I can kind of zero in on what are the best types of calls. So I can get a good sampling.
01:09:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, the other crazy thing is that now you have like, this the AI agents the voice AI oh yeah so like imagine all your calls I'm not saying you do this right now but if you have a voice AI that acted as like acted as I'm just gonna say secretary but active like the first line in of every call goes to this same person and all their job is is to do that qualification piece have you been in an accident oh okay great let me let me put you in touch with and it could literally say Patsy and then it would try to transfer the call to Patsy like automatically you could definitely get to that in the very near future yeah which is still got some more I'm sure you saw like McDonald's stop doing it so the other ones it yeah you have to train the AI 100% well we're actually testing so we So, I don't think I've ever mentioned this before, initially we had going back to when we first started Leopler, where it's not a bot, but we had this text automation. We're like, hey, you're probably on your phone right now, going to try calling you. That's all just if then type , it's very linear in a way. There's some decision. Free stuff happening, but then we put in the AI bot. Just overnight, like, let's say we did two months ago, I forget how long ago we do it, but we compared the chat automation versus the AI bot and they're kind of neck and neck. So now we opened up the AI bot a little more to some of the other leads, but we're, we're going to go out and test this other AI bot. that's even more intelligent than what we had. So Eric's building that bot right now, but that service that we're using that we're testing, they actually doing voice AI as well, but I mess with that side of it. Yeah, we'll see.
01:12:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not working interesting. Are you from now? For I don't like to put dependencies on new technology that could be expensive if it failed. I like to play with new technology when it's just a playground and it's kind of sandbox and it can't hurt anything. But for this type of thing, because your front line is so important, I'd probably wait a few months at the very least, but if not more like a year until that's really honed out. Well, the other thing is, then they're becoming... comes a greater market awareness, more people are familiar, hey, there are AI agents, you know, we're talking to people and it just becomes a little bit more accepted and more mainstream so that you don't risk alienating people that may be like, oh, there's a pause in between every conversation. This is AI, you know, I don't know how many people know but those are just the things to think about as technology evolves and arises. I think that we're going to want to implement it. I think that it is the way to the most leveraged business but I think that the on-ramp should be slow. I'm a huge proponent of the technology and AI. love it but I think it has to have guardrails and I think certain types of it need to really be well refined than what other people be guinea pigs before we go. there and the front line of your business is definitely one of those places.
01:14:06 - mark sweet
It's cool. But yeah, I get what you're saying.
01:14:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, Dan has a rule of, you know, what would be cool is, yeah, I don't hate it. No, no, no, you know what cool, you know, what could be cool is bad. It's automatic red flag.
01:14:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's a yeah, that might be cool. But what would be cool is if you could burn more leads period.
01:14:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, which is, you know, we've got a good plan in place. So, oh, wait, the question was, my last question, Dan was, do you need a reminder to set me up an account so I can go listen to calls?
01:14:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I'll do right now because I'm already in there.
01:14:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yee-haw. And then Mark to follow up with you on Lorenz and Patrick, how would you Do you like to proceed?
01:15:01 - mark sweet
can email and we can talk to them and see what their schedules look like. And I'll just text you on the side and we'll figure it out.
01:15:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And also, if we're doing whatever the pay in full for the year, would rather that.
01:15:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh yeah, there you go. Because you paid differently. No, what do you mean? There you go. I have no idea what I'm talking about. Bill, I'm going to do that on task.
01:15:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Bill doesn't do me. Anyway, I don't know how you pay Dan, but he pays me through PayPal, and I'd rather not have PayPal take a huge chunk out of that. So I can send wire information or something.
01:15:42 - mark sweet
So I do for a bigger contract. to vote Dan and I like our points a lot.
01:15:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. That's right.
01:15:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's right. I do.
01:15:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
take fees too, but I can all take fees.
01:15:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think PayPal and Stripe are pretty much the same. right? I have no idea.

Good morning.
00:00:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good morning. How are you?
00:00:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
How are you?
00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good.
00:00:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Something happened to my speaker. Hold on. Where is my speaker? Testing, testing. You hear me now? Yep, there it is.
00:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you? Good. Good. How was my birthday?
00:00:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Good. Yeah, she was really happy at the beach, I think. We are going to take her to Disneyland next week, so that will be her other little two-day Disneyland trip.
00:00:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's awesome. And next week we're good for 10 a.m.
00:00:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, that's a good question. Let me double check that. Labor day, yeah.
00:00:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we will be good. Okay, good. We're having our little vacation.
00:01:04 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We'll be back Sunday night.
00:01:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's not a problem for me either. like, I like not moving my calls unless I have vacation or something going on if I vacation, but otherwise stay on track makes it easier for me.
00:01:19 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, cool.
00:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. Mark works pretty much every weekend. So I mean, every, every holiday. And he's another Monday meeting. And the other client I have on Mondays too. So let's see. I gotta go back to your emails. had them open and then I lost them. Okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I was definitely on the it's not. So in terms of just looking at your stuff. For me, the thing that always to look at is just just awareness. So, there's lots of things that make an impact on sleep. Think about what they are, notice them from time to time. If things aren't the way that you want to, try and change the things that do make a difference on sleep just biologically for everyone, see if it helps, but I think the biggest things that you've noticed is that getting enough sleep makes a huge difference for you. You did take a nap a couple times and you're, let's see, trying to remember what happened with that.
00:02:39 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't think I had any apps, did I?
00:02:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
might have been the macros I was thinking about, because anyway- Oh yeah, I saved this. Yeah, so anyway, yeah, paying attention to that, we don't, we don't have to go into that, but all of the practices. is and again with the holistic approach is because your business runs on you and you run on sleep and you trip in and everything else so do pay attention to it do what you can but the other thing was being obsessive about it doesn't do well so it almost seems like i'm being contradictory because we dug into it too much there's a difference with how much weight you give something mentally so i look at it but i don't think about it the rest of time i look at it and go huh maybe i'll try this put it in an experiment and then i'm not thinking about it anymore i don't worry about it so and knowing that you can make adjustments throughout the week like you did that with ester ester was giving you extra time to sleep in right so that was something that you did I do think that macros didn't make a little difference, but that's okay. If it doesn't just pay attention to those things, we don't need to talk about them. If you have any, you just like notice things are bad, rough, whatever, just see if anybody else has any ideas. if I have ideas, that's fine, but I love the business stuff too. But the holistic approach is always just, how are you? How are you taking care of yourself? Are you taking care of yourself? Do you are, you know, that's it. So it's a small conversation, a little bit every week, and I'll ask you that, are you taking care of yourself? How are you doing? Have you been feeling? That's important. The details can be up to you, but what happens sometimes is I'll catch up. Like when you got on the call today, there was an exhale, and that could have just been nothing, or it could be just, there's a lot going on, and I'm just trying to get focused.
00:04:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
so as I get to know you a little bit better, I'll run back from an open house. So I was trying to rush in the
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
door to make the meeting see there's lots of little things so I'll ask about it because I just want to make sure because we don't usually have people taking care of us in our business now you have your wife taking care of you but seeing how that correlation is to the business and also she's going through so much right now she needs to be taken care of so that's that's just kind of part of it so it's it was a getting to know you all these things love it all right so did you happen to notice any correlation with movements to sleep at all uh it's hard not I I really don't know I mean yeah yeah yeah I for me I can make the correlations but because there's so many guardables it's almost always that some things are good one day but the other things are bad yeah so and that's again why knowing what things make it difference because some things will be bad. But if I can get the other things in, for example, if I just was super stressed out or whatever, and I didn't get a lot of movement, I just walk, I pace my house. And I sleep a little bit better. get to sleep better. I digest better. Blah blah blah. Anyway, okay. So you got all the reports done. Yeah? Yeah. That felt good.
00:06:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And you're down and here's happy with you. Yeah. And well, we'll see he hasn't responded. I texted him. I said, he sent you all the reports. He said, okay, I'll look over him find you didn't he changes. I'll let you know. So I'll feed those into the model when they come.
00:06:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like you said somebody was happy with you about it though.
00:06:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, my manager, Nicole. That's what I said and your manager, right?
00:06:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah.
00:06:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. She was happy.
00:06:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:06:52 - Fujinaka, M.D.
She's been bugging me. She messages me every three days.
00:06:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And we're not going to let those stop pile anymore unless he gets Oh, about it.
00:07:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, that was fun though, because I could I could I want to try to keep training in the model now that I know I'm getting closer with it.
00:07:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Okay, so let me where's my notes, I have them open. I am tabzilla over here. Um, I'm going back and forth. Actually, I just need to keep multiple windows open with your message and my notes. Spending any time on Delta. And you got her, let's see. um, it's Esther's manager. What's her first name just so I can instead of saying Esther manager, I can say a name, one word.
00:07:51 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, it's Nicole.
00:07:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's Nicole. Okay. So you have the confidentiality and trade sequence.
00:07:58 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, that's her. Yeah, actually, uh, last. Yeah, I emailed her, talked to her and I messaged her again, and yeah, this is reminded of her, know, and then I then I told her how to do the, the requests for Q and E that requests for Q and E numbers. So yeah, she hopefully she'll get on that.
00:08:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. Did you give her a due date for requesting them this time so we can get them soon?
00:08:24 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I was gonna have, I was gonna have a wait till September 1st.
00:08:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so when do you think that we'll have the most recent reports?
00:08:37 - Fujinaka, M.D.
They usually take about seven days, so if you request sit on September 1st, then maybe about September 10th, do want to get it?
00:08:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:08:47 - Fujinaka, M.D.
They're the state, they're like DMV.
00:09:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then she's going to request them on the first, or roughly that every month.
00:09:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. I also had her send me a brief. Extra night of brief email about how many upcoming visits we have and how many visits we had the previous month. So I'll start having her check that and giving us reports so we can see how we did the previous month and how we're looking at how many appointments we have booked for the coming month.
00:09:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's awesome. And did you ask yourself why you haven't done that yet before?
00:09:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, no, just that I, you know, I do it sporadically, but I never had a system that to watch that. So now you're going to do that. Yes. Good. Now, because I was sending you the numbers and I know that I know the cash flow coming in and you know I can watch that weekly how much cash comes in. into the account but I don't know but I don't know how like my current month is or the month before was.
00:10:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right it's great because when you when you watch those patterns it gives more certainty so sometimes it can alleviate stress but also like if you have it and just think oh I'm not doing well but the other thing the other potential issue is complacency and apathy about it and just like do the thing and then you realize that there's a pattern of a little less a little less a little less and it's much harder to try to correct what's happening you know when you're not watching it so and it's very it's so much easier to maintain than to catch up.
00:10:45 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Sure that makes a second believe that. I kind of want to put it on the manager a little at the end because I was listening to I am I did leave a little bit to kind of power her, I said, hey, what, what, tell me also give me one sentence, what do you see in this trend, and what do you think, if anything, we should recommend what we should do. So I do want to put it on her because she's supposed to take everything off Esther's plate, manage the whole business, that part of it. So I did kind of put that in there to send me a little sentence or two every month about what she sees in our numbers, because if my numbers drop off, she's not going to have a job, right? If something has to get cut, Esther's going to come back to work, we're not going to need a manager anymore, you know, we're going to tighten ships. So it's in her best interest as well to like make sure my numbers stay popular.
00:11:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Love that.
00:11:45 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So we'll do that.
00:11:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Amazing job delegating, very, very good.
00:11:52 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Now that I think about it, maybe I should just have her since she's actually in the county, maybe she should just put this into a spreadsheet.
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. of everything that you have. So, then the other thing is potentially you might want like kind of like a dashboard workbook. So with Google Sheets, just like Excel, you can pull data in from multiple sheets and documents or because sometimes if you put too much data, they get big, they take too long to open. So pulling from multiple ones might be the thing to do, but either way, whatever, you want to have all the pertinent information in one source as often as possible like a snapshot slash dashboard so that it's very easy for you to be very mindful about where everything is and it's also very easy for you to track and make sure that whoever is responsible for getting the data is doing it because you have one thing to look at and is everything populated. So... Let's see, um, KPIs are, um, how many appointments coming in? how many get canceled would be a good one. So what else are you tracking that matters to you that, you know, a difference in your business? Thank you, Mise.
00:13:27 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Um, yeah, so there are initial consults where I see them the first time and and reevaluations where I see them subsequent times. So I want to make sure that I'm getting enough initial consults. So I actually told her to split the report. Tell me how many initials new patients I get because that tells me how I'm going to be how I am doing. And then how many follow ups I get follow ups just tell me, you know, what's the kind of the reoccurring business, but it's the new. all the time that comes in. So I did have her split that report up like that. That's really the biggest thing that we're that I'm tracking on the health of the business. Everything else is pretty constant that costs for the schedulers, the cost for, we pay someone to pre-call the patients so that I don't have to talk to them so long. The cost for the story to pre-call and we pay someone to summarize my records for me. So they take all the raw records, all the Kaiser records, and condense it into 100 pages. like all those things are pretty constant. So it's really just how much inflow we have that determines our number.
00:14:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so everything is referred to you, right? Yep.
00:14:53 - Fujinaka, M.D.
by attorneys, only I feel like you said that there was another source.
00:15:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, this, is it's a lottery pick based on what I write, write, sorry, I want to go, I, I will probably for a while mean go live medical with me. Yeah. Okay, so that's the lottery. And that's why we want the report so that we can try to get that now. I mean, it's 100% a lottery, right? They don't remove anybody that got something last month and we don't know.
00:15:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We just we think that like they don't tell you how it's done, but they tell you it's by zip code and and your proximity to that zip code. But we have tried putting like two names, like we put myself in two zip codes to see if it doubles my count. It doesn't really double it. So we think there's more to the algorithm than just, you know, zip code.
00:15:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know if they don't share that with us.
00:15:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We're not. You did explain that before, but again, there's a lot to kind of memorize about how the business works. It's a very niche area.
00:16:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For sure. Okay.
00:16:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Thankful for the very profitable for us for the time I spent on it.
00:16:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you can only be in 10 cities at a time, right? And you have that max out. We're going to get that reports where we can do some numbers. Is it possible to get a retroactive? So when they send you the reports, is it for the month or do they send you the whole year? Do they send it broken down by months?
00:16:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, what do I to call what I want to call this? I'm just having her send it month by month.
00:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because what would be really interesting is to see some historical data over like the past two years month by month plotted to see if there's any kind of variation or any kind of pattern to observe by location.
00:17:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, we have all the data. We have it all. It's created a sales force, a custom sales force.
00:17:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no, I mean, the, the, the, so how many incidents, how many doctors over time.
00:17:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah. Don't give it to you.
00:17:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You just have to request it from the state. So when she requested, can you request that so we can have so we can look at the, if there's any, any kind of patterns that might pop out in terms of is everything pretty consistent. Is there any kind of big jump, whatever.
00:17:51 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So kind of like a month, a month by month. Over the last two over the last year.
00:18:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
something right so by how many incidents and how many doctors and the population I'm sure the population doesn't change a lot but we don't want to make any assumptions so there are so many zip codes and there are you know development areas what do we not know that most people are never going to dig into and this may seem like not a big deal but like when we so I'll give an example for sweet law that I feel is totally appropriate and uh you're not going to go tell me maybe it's not appropriate I don't know I have to think about this just operations-wise but basically what we did and I can make it generic enough that it won't matter is that we looked at a few different things that impacted the business um like where where things come from where the leads come from um states things like that and what we noticed is that we have a dependency tea upon a couple of things and didn't seem to have a lot of ability to increase those. But we just put some effort into that and it created some leverage to show where a couple of things dropped off that would have cost us the business like just put us in a horrible situation. We had mitigated that by knowing what the data was and manipulating it to the best of our abilities and it ended up making all the difference in the world. For example, because you are able to move locations easily, just kind of get a satellite office, whatever. If we happen to see that there is some shifting happening, you could do that. I know location that's just exploding right now. but for whatever reason, no doctors are increasing there or it's not increasing at a proportionate rate. And maybe that's only going to be for a short amount of time before somebody gets there. That short amount of time could be a year and half, so it takes you six months to get there. You have a year there kind of dominating the area because nobody else noticed.
00:20:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'll add that to Nicole's thing. She's going to send me that when she first requests this, she's going to send me a draft of the email.
00:20:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So to that email, I'll add, I'll tell them, I want to separate Excel tab for each of the previous months as well, going back, I'll even go back six months over the beginning of 2024. Plus, I would imagine that there's a correlation between construction and accidents.
00:20:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't know. I don't know. It's by zip code, so.
00:20:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, so like if there's a development and there's just a lot of popular development happening in a particular location, which if a developer invests, that would happen. Anyway, I don't know. But looking at the data is how it helps us to figure out is there anything that we can really do about it. So if there's not, do you have the option of getting another doctor that works for you, that is that a possibility that it's completely separate other business, but that you hold the purse strings and.
00:21:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, so the way the business works right now is 100, you know, 100% of the money comes in, so 2000 a report. And then I pay me personally, and the doctor pays 40% to be 46. B46 is the billing and collection company that Esther owns. Okay. So our former company called Ava used to be that collection company. We actually had 15 of my friends. I recruited them in the. that. And so we were doing revenue of about 750,000 a month to that company. And that's the one that our partner was a and we closed it because we're like, we don't care how much we make, it's not worth being a business for that guy. So we actually came. was tricky legally because we didn't want to get sued for, you know, essentially closing a business starting a new one. But that's what we did. closed the old one, started a new one with just me and one of my friends who's my oldest friend. So we could argue in court that, well, I knew this guy before Ava, before we closed it, he's my long friend. That's why he came to our new billing company. So our current billing company has me and one of the QME that we make that Esther's company, B46, makes the 40% from. But yeah, it's always a quite, we were thinking like Esther thought, do we want to expand again? Maybe we can't I take the same 15 doctors because of non-competes, but we could go out and recruit 15 or however many new doctors to get that remedy. But right now, we're in a good place in our life, and it's pretty simple with just me and the other doctor for her and our manager. If we were to increase or double the size of that doctorable, we would have to increase the number. Scheduler has increased the number of editors, historians. The whole operation becomes more difficult with each doctor and astronaut just made the decision work. Right now, anyway, we're not going to expand, but yeah, you're absolutely right, your sense system. That is a way you can expand is get other doctor, private doctors to work for our building company, and we take 40% of their cut. We take a cut of 40%.
00:23:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, is that something that you think about? This is not the season of life, but you want to do it? I just want to understand what all the goals and the values are. are because I love that you guys have put a limit on and understood what happens if you scale up the burden of management. I think her having her company that she does really is a great kind of partnership because understanding that a lot of people just don't take that into account. They don't think about how much work it is to manage that increase. But it's a lot. And everything is a trade-off and sometimes that trade-off is just not worth it.
00:24:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So I love that you guys have thought about that. Yeah, we think that, you know, we increased back if we built back up to 15 and we're doing revenue, you know, that revenue. have ways we think we would have been more profitable. Like we we we've now outsourced 50 percent of her workforce. So we have three W-2 U.S. employees, which are incredibly expensive, right? like 7,000 a month. And then on the backside, actually have three Filipino that are... the cost of one US workers. So, you know, if we redid this, we know how we would scale it in the future. But, you know, the profit margins weren't as impressive. Like, you think, oh, you know, this guy makes 15,000, you see seven patients, he makes 14,000 of revenue in one day. 40% of that comes to our business. Well, we were actually only seeing like profits of our cut. We were only seeing like less like 5% profit maybe. And that was because we had an entire US workforce. So, we think that when we did a Filipino workforce, we could probably get closer to like 20% profit margin. But, you know, much is that for the amount of work? Because now your operation is just ridiculous. And is that that much money for that amount of work? So, that's the other thing we're balancing. Like, it's just, we, you think it's really profitable because it's like, holy cow, you know, 40% of $2,000, to schedule this. doctors visit but yeah the profit margins just weren't that high and I've talked to other owners of building companies and they say the same thing yeah our profits are like 20 percent and or yeah or 8 percent other one says 8 percent so yeah that's the other reason we're just like you know we could wrap back up to the 15 doctors but you know is that is it worth it for that amount operational headache right um maybe one day I'm not sure right okay so let me make sure that I I write this and keep asking that question yeah we've thought about it quite a lot because it's so yeah we I mean you know from a recruitment standpoint I don't think I'd have trouble bringing in other trends to do this it's such a lucrative gig but yeah I mean there's just a lot how do you get to it's so lucrative and then it's five percent so like
00:27:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For the doctors, it's lucrative, right, because you make 60% of $2,000 per visit.
00:27:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And if I see, if I see seven patients a day, which is typical, that's $14,000 and I get 60% of that. So that's like $9,000. mean, a doctor, there's, there's very few doctors in the United States that can make 9,000 a day. Plastic surgeons will hit that. Yeah, maybe just plastic surgeons can hit that. I mean, but there's very few doctors that can make 9,000 a day, except in this. So.
00:27:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so there's two components to this. That is your billing company gets 5%. But you as a doctor, generating those leads for yourself that 60%.
00:27:47 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, 60% on company gets 40%. Right. And of that 40% we think the profit margins. 10% 5% who knows. Well, now it's higher, right, not because now we've cut out we've done. So now of that 40%, the profit margin closer to like 20, 30%. So our profit is already higher in Esther's billing company now, but the old company was like 5% or less profit margin.
00:28:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So now your profit margin, her billing company is what?
00:28:20 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We haven't, it's only been open for the last year, so the trailing year, the numbers 30, maybe we think, maybe 20, maybe 15, I don't know. So what happened after that old company closed and we separated from our partner, I bring all my old business, like the legality of that, we're not quite sure. But we took all the business and we just said, more receivables are going to come into this new company, so it looks like we had this massive amount of revenue for very little work. So, technically, the old partner signed off is okay on that, so we're kind of legally covered, but so anyway, yeah, the whole last year and a half, like, revenue for B46 looks very good because we didn't have to do a lot of work for that revenue. But, but yeah, the trailing six months look like the profit margins are closer to 20.
00:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, I, my brain wants to ask questions about that, but I don't, I don't know if that's anything that you want to discuss about, but the one thing I would say is I'd get clear on that those numbers. Okay, because they're you're intermingling and you are, it's obviously taking that brain space. How well it's doing. It's an important thing to you into the family. So I would get really clear on the percentages and just go ahead and get your books really clearly caught up and then see what pops out.
00:30:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
anything.
00:30:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you're doing better than you thought you were, not doing as good as you thought you are, either way, knowing is going to be really empowering, especially with the rest of the conversation that we will have. So the two tracks are interesting. So let me go back to the top of these notes real quick. You said Q and E is your most profitable thing, right?
00:30:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yes.
00:30:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you currently spend about how many days a month?
00:30:34 - Fujinaka, M.D.
feel like you said it was like 10 or 11. Oh yeah, I have this up, I was going to show you.
00:30:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can I share my video?
00:30:41 - Fujinaka, M.D.
you see? see a spreadsheet or do you see a profit and loss marketing by twenty twenty oh that's that's July sorry okay okay so this is my QME calendar okay let me show you September it's a little cleaner August was messy because of the baby so this is the first week of September on the top row second week of September I have two days of work you'll see one day is called depot that's where I do cross examinations from home I call into court essentially and then I have like one two three four five six seven seven so I start at nine and at four and there's always some cancellations and then the next day I work is Thursday and it says San Landro so I have I go to San Landro which is about an hour away and these the visits I have so I do about ten visits this day then the following week I do one two This is three, four. So I do four days of work there. The following week after that, I do one, two, So in the month, I do one, two, four, five, six, eight, nine. Yeah, about nine, nine or 10. Sometimes eight, seven, seven. We usually try to fill up the places, like this is kind of empty. We try to avoid days where we only see four patients. try to, but we're booking three months ahead. So sometimes it's hard to predict if a month is gonna fill up. So like we thought this would fill up with at least six, but it only got four in the lottery in Sanderfell. Okay. Daily City, we're over pack, right? have 12 here. So that's gonna be a really busy day. And Oakland, this is about right. has, think there's seven here, right? So there are six. So that's about right. Stock 10, again, this is a little on the heavy side. There's nine, I think here. Modesto, it's about right, about nine. That's almost perfect. And then Merced, we just opened a location in Merced, California. That only has two, but because we're starting it, we will accept just doing two visits.
00:33:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I have a question. You as a doctor can only operate in 10 cities. Is that correct or is it the business?
00:33:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, my name, you know, yeah, me as a doctor can only have 10 locations at once. And you see, I actually have two San Jose. I have a, I have a North San Jose and a South San Jose location because I was getting so much in San Jose. Unfortunately, like the one of the San Jose, it just hasn't really borne out. The, the South San Jose location hasn't filled up as much as we thought. But we were getting such high volume there. We thought, okay, well, let's split San Jose actually east and west. We took it. We have a west location that's killing it. Let's try and eat San Jose, but it hasn't borne. out that it's given us more. So it's one of the ones that we might close next.
00:34:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That would be interesting to see the correlation between your reports, your appointments and the reports and see if it lines up because there isn't an algorithm that you guys can figure out yet to see if there's anything. And that's also something that we can feed to chat GBT. We have to figure out how to get the data to align. But basically if we can put the put it in the spread sheet so that we can say here's all the lottery information. Here's how many doctors. Here's the zip codes. Here's the injuries. Here's what we scheduled. patterns do you notice if any?
00:34:53 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I could have chat sheet if you look at it because the you know it's the row is built of zip code. There's a number of doctors. and the number of lotteries total, and it wouldn't be too hard to add in my own column to that and say, this is actually how many I got in this one, and then just put that one number, how my manager put that number for any new code, and then now you have all the data on one, you could put that in and attach it to chat to BT and say, hey, look at these, only these zip codes, and the rows associated with them, what trends do you see? Yeah.
00:35:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And what correlation do you see? But also I always ask it, what questions could I ask you to help me understand?
00:35:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Because I don't know what I don't know.
00:35:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm interested. What kind of analysis should I be asking you to do? you know, what other data might be helpful? All kinds of things. I ask questions all the way around it, because it has better capabilities than I do, and there are just some processes that I wouldn't
00:36:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
think of and sometimes it's helpful and sometimes it's not.
00:36:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sometimes it's just very simple. So feed it the data but also say, you know, when you ask your question, what am I not asking that I'm missing out on that I could be getting from this data?
00:36:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. That's a good question.
00:36:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ask it.
00:36:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So, yeah, I actually, I'll go ahead and request, like you said, the trailing months. Maybe I will do the two years, so I'll request the trailing two months of spreadsheets from the state of California. And then I have my manager just essentially go back and just put in. So, I'll probably have her put in the number of initials and the number of reevals. Yeah. think, oh, I don't know. The initials are what really tell me how I'm doing because sometimes I might get eight reevals, like if you don't like those, but some of these locations like you'll see in that like daily. city. I'm like, well, I got 10 people, but if you look at it, it's actually eight reevaluations and two initials. So that means, in the future, I'm only going to have two, if I only had two initials this month, I'm only going to get two return visits, because you usually see the patients.
00:37:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, right, right.
00:37:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So yeah, maybe in that spreadsheet, I don't know, think about it a little bit. Maybe I should just have, I'll put both numbers in, I'll have her do both, but the initial account and the reeval count, but the initial was the one I really want to, I really want to track. Okay. Yeah, but yeah, I'll do that.
00:37:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that's a great idea. Yeah, so the other thing, the other question to ask chat TPT is, do you notice any trends changing where it seems like, okay, so I would tell it how your business works, fully explain the lottery system and say, my goal is to figure you're out if there's a way I can increase my odds at obtaining customers through the yeah through the lottery system do you notice anything sorry that's oh yeah I've got a that sweet law um in 20 minutes um do you notice anything that might increase and I would tell it all the parameters I can only be in 10 zip codes it takes me six months to create a new all everything give it and make that one chat the chat about Q&E numbers and lottery you know yeah and then come back and let me know what what it tells you what you notice and then we'll take that but yeah let's I love when people will play smart and leverage AI so we can get some really good data really quickly yeah that's really exciting I love it I love it my work on that all right so let me go I had everything shrunk so I could see this. Let me, I'm just looking at your P&L for a minute.
00:39:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Which book would be for July or MFF?
00:39:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, July. July for July.
00:39:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
July for July, that's right.
00:39:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Whoa, don't do that. Okay.
00:39:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
The P&L. July P&L. July, July P&L.
00:39:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, you have January for July.
00:39:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
July's been my best month. My August isn't shaping up to look like this. Like I actually, we settled $100,000 with the cases. August looks like it's going to be close to 60. Oh, wow. Yeah, varies quite a lot. Maybe even 40. I don't know. We'll see.
00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how long have you been doing it this by yourself like this separate from the previous business with the partners?
00:40:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I actually have it ready for you here If you could see this it's kind of small, but I started in April I Started in April of 2023 that was month one these numbers are like how many months I've been in business so Month 16 is July so I've been so as of July I've been in month 16 months It's been open 16 months and these are the number of referrals I got per month. So the first month I got 80 then 120 so on Yeah, so then the Follow-up visits can't be very much Yeah, so These are the number of new referrals, but I don't track the number of follow-ups yet I could probably add that next month So if you have total visits completed does that include follow-ups? Yeah, this is initials and follow-ups.
00:41:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, I mean, just eyeballing that data. I would say you can't have that many follow-ups.
00:41:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, most of the time it's just one and done. I do an initial console and they're gone. I'm the MRI order.
00:41:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I order MRIs to physical data. Is there a way, so I assume you get paid for follow-ups also. Yeah. And is it a profitable? Is it, is there any difference really in initial sources follow-ups in terms of profits?
00:41:39 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I reduced my billing by three and so I built 1,200 for the initials and then 900 for follow-ups. No, there's, it's usually just to probe out a percent. I'll follow-up on maybe 250. So, it's still great. anything above like 150, I'm really happy.
00:41:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, There's multiple questions in this, but the best way to, well, we're always looking for leverage, and leverage is how do we get more out of what we already have. So there are already people that are coming across your path that have given you authority for whatever reason, lottery doesn't matter, but they have to talk to you, they have to deal with all these limiting parameters, right, they didn't come to you because they're trying to improve their health or whatever.
00:42:36 - Fujinaka, M.D.
But that doesn't mean there's not an opportunity for something.
00:42:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if you were to think about it, and again, these are accidents or whatever, do you think that there's any kind of follow-up care type of package that falls within your legal ability to offer to them that you would want to do that is just a tiny bit that would encourage them to come back that also might be paid for by insurance and somehow could be connected to, you know, is something that already pays helps them get it paid for and you get money in your pocket and they get a little additional like ethically actual real value. And then it could be something that's just let's increase your odds of making sure that everything's okay for you and that you know how to recognize the signs that I can compare how you work whatever.
00:43:37 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, no, it's you're brilliant to pick that up so quickly. Yes, there is. So right now, I make for instance, we'll just use sweet law after the initial consults done and I take care of that. I wait for their case manager to say hey, my client needs a follow-up visit with July medical. Can you give my client? and that's how I wait for permission but to your point yes I could proactively reach out to the case manager and say hey it's been six months six weeks since your client saw me would you like your client would you like you know for me to check up with your client to see how they're doing in a follow-up visit and proactively bug them the second way I could do it is I could try to get MRI results sent to me right now the MRIs I don't know where they get their MRIs I'm agnostic I just give them the order and tell their lawyer send them to an MRI at a hospital I don't care I could be more proactive about asking the case manager send me their MRI send me their MRI so I look at it and that prompts the case manager say oh yeah they got the MRI why don't you see them again so yes there's there's actually one more part
00:45:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
part that I think that you could do that actually benefits you and the attorneys that send them over to you based off of what I know about street law is that first of all tag teaming a doctor and the attorney office saying we recommend you go in for a follow-up to make sure that nothing has appeared since your initial visits because it can right over time.
00:45:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh yeah, new body parts that started to get sore.
00:45:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right and so it maybe it was there before but they just didn't notice and then it starts nagging long enough that their brain goes oh actually this is bugging me I just didn't realize because a lot of people just don't realize but the attorney's office benefits right because if they if the injury is more significant then higher settlement and they get a higher percentage and then you get more business but ethically we're also helping the person who's busy who really doesn't want to deal with any of this doesn't want to deal with our health issues that might happen. that more problems 10, 20, 30 years down the road, that if somebody had just looked out for them and said, you should go do this, and just make sure, because things do take time to kind of present themselves. So if you could create a system where, look, this is what happens, I need you to put it on your calendar in six weeks, mark a follow up, unless I tell you 100%, we don't need another follow up. And then you pitch them on the idea, the main person say, go make sure your people are doing this, because there's no way, there's no way, there's no way. I'm gonna tell you to do the math and you track it. There's no way that if you didn't implement a system like this, you're not going to see profit margins increase. It may not be a huge amount, but it for sure will be above and beyond what it costs you to do that.
00:46:53 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, okay.
00:46:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because you're giving two authority sources, your attorney and your doctor telling you to do same thing. And as long as you know that you're being ethical about it, meaning there's nobody coming in, you're 100% sure they don't need to be reached out again, in which case you should tag them, flag them and say, do not follow up with this person so that you know you're operating an integrity.
00:47:18 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, that's going to give you a lift. Yeah, yeah, I agree. That's what was saying too. Yeah, I, uh, yeah, I don't have a real good answer for why I don't do that. Yeah, I don't have a good answer.
00:47:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just, I didn't ask a question. Why don't you do that? I'm just saying, let's do it.
00:47:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I right now, like, um, I'll have to think of a solution for a way to tag that it's been six weeks, six, eight weeks since their first visit.
00:47:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that actually comes back to you. What I wanted to see was how do you manage your clients?
00:47:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What is your just done. This is confidential, so please don't share this.
00:48:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't.
00:48:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, no. Yeah, so when a new referral comes in, I simply, we have an email inbox. I actually don't even have an example here. So we get this email like this from an attorney and says, Hi, you know, my patient wants a new consultation. Please tell us when they fit. What we do is we've added an email program, and it allows us to tag emails. And we tag it as new referral. And once that tag gets on it, it goes to a scheduler. And then once the scheduling is done, they tag it that scheduling and demographics is done. It goes to another person who preps the the business notes. So they go into my Google drive and for a patient. they make a folder. So like they put their name on their folder, the patient's name, DataBird, and then they put this thing, they make an invoice, they do a new patient visit note, which is like a templated note, and then they do a order form note. So it has like prescriptions that I wanna have to memorize. And once my staff does that, then it's ready for the appointment. And so when I get on the phone or the video with them, I open the folder, it already has the invoice, it has the note, pretty much made the order form. I fill in the blanks. After the visit's done, I go through and I mark that the appointment's complete, which is what happened here. And then I okay it for final, and that lets the team send it out. So everything is done with email tagging. So that's why I was trying to figure out, is there a way, I just, don't know a good way to put the six-week tag, because once we're done, I put completed as a tag, but yeah, generally, I don't really know a good way.
00:50:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll think about You could do initial complete and then follow up for six weeks, something like that. You would have to alter your system, but also, this needs to be in a database, and this needs to be in something. This long-term and scalable. There's much potential for loss, and also insufficient data. You can't go in and see how many cases are in X status. You should be able to see that.
00:50:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I have sort of that. I can check how many... This column right, it don't tell me that there's 13 reports that we're waiting on the signature. These are okay for final. I have okay them, but the patient hasn't signed their... consent form, so we can't send them yet. So we do kind of have that, but like we don't have a way to like you know like rolling check like these are there's four people that are ready for today. These are the four that are going to have appointments today with us. So we kind of I can kind of see it like that, but it's all just very real time.
00:51:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's not a great long term solution. It's amazing for being email. I mean, I'm proud for that. What's it called that you're using?
00:51:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I just did Melli's. Okay, so this goes back to two, you know, early on when we when I was talking to Mark about starting this business, we had said that, you know, we we have I have to be sort of careful that I don't get too big law firms to get big. But doctors, if we get too big, we stick up like a nail.
00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then the insurance company is investing in us.
00:52:03 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So initially, I don't have to talk to Mark more about this, but he was saying, you know, you want to try to stay around like maybe 400 a month. And again, he's saying, you know, and obviously it depends on the lawyer, right? If you're taking cases from lawyers that confabulate, they lie about their cases, they try to make the patients look hurt, you're going to get investigated along with those law firms. So, you know, his point is always like, take good business. Yeah. And that's what, I mean, we have, I think for the most part been taking, like I've cut out a couple law firms that I know lie about their patients. But I am at that point, you can see from my numbers where we are getting really close to like that 400. so that's why like right now I'm really happy where I am. I'm not really looking at, like if I could just keep this volume, this is, I'm really happy. This is like a one point, maybe $1.5 million a year business for me. At this level, it takes very little work. I mean, I only work on this, what, four hour, five hours a week.
00:53:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have a ceiling that you've installed intentionally. And you're okay with that. And so then the your wealth increase you would want through July or. Delta or other other things and just make sure that this is managed. As well as possible to reduce maybe the time the energy. Maybe increase the profit margins by improving operations, but not increasing business volume.
00:53:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Is that right? Yeah, that's a good summary. mean, yeah, it's at a good place right now. mean, like if you look at the P and L right like my contractors cost me 20,000 a month. I mean, that is, and you know, total expenses are about 40. I mean, it's my profit margins are about like for this month, we're about 60%. And I think the profit margin, I think, is only going to go up because I'm going to collect more for the same amount of expense. My expenses, this expense isn't going to go up. So, yeah, mean, I think if I start settling out more cases and I'm starting to make 150, 200 a month, that expense is going to stay the same. And, yeah, so anyway, yeah.
00:54:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so, and I did it again, I blended QME in July for a minute because we're talking about July 1st. So, QME and July have fixed ceilings that the most important thing that you can do inside of them is make sure that you've got the most efficient system. So, it reduces how much time, energy it takes and max profit margins, but there is a cap and you're very near the top at both of them.
00:55:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, mean, July, based on what I've heard from Mark with my current business in California, and QMEs, I'm limited by the 10 locations and physically how many days a month I want to do, or I can't do, QMEs, there are other ways I can expand.
00:55:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can get direct referrals for work comp, I didn't go into that with you.
00:55:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
But for July, I mean, in California, this is where I kind of want to sit almost right there. The other way that we could do it is I could expand other states and start opening separate clinics in each state, right, and ramp each state individually up to 400.
00:55:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which is what we're doing with Sweet Law is expanding in the states, and that's been it's been crazy to watch.
00:55:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I heard, yeah, so actually I hadn't even readressed this ceiling issue until we just talked about it. But yeah, I mean, it's this operation. mission is so simple how I have it like with the email like actually now that you mentioned maybe like the easiest path to another million of revenue for my family is just opening it up in Washington and opening it up and I have I've expanded July like these numbers that you see these new referrals I mean we know that about probably 40 of these or 50 are coming from Washington, New Mexico, Washington, Mexico and Arizona and uh sweet loss sending it to us right and other laws because we're in all those states right so I'm following mark but I could branch off from July and open a brand new clinic in Washington brand new one in Arizona that would technically allow me to ramp up each of those states the 400 so yeah I'll think about that actually it's interesting so when you think about it what I would like you to do is do the inventory what would that take what would it look like so what would be the time impact
00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
for you, what would be the human resources that you need, would be the marketing, like draw the whole picture, what would have to happen, what would be the timeline, what would be the cost, is there, are you going to be negative at any point, like are you going to have to output money, probably not, but if you did, what does that look like? And then, so the biggest math is going to be time and energy impact for you because if that, if we can keep that to something you're willing to do, let's say 10 hours a month, whatever that looks like, really do the math to that and the revenue because the numbers are going to tell you you should do it or not. I can just about bet with what I've seen in your schedule that another state, one other state could be like the whole difference of a year, but also what you learn out of it and the additional financial resources that it could give you to maybe put. towards other things, maybe hiring, maybe marketing firms, maybe better software, whatever, I don't really know, like we're really just getting into this. But doing a projection exercise about what it would look like to go into, and I would be strategic about even the projecting state, like I would run the projections across multiple states, get as much data as you can to kind of and figure that out. So a correlation for, Mark, you said you're in Washington, New Mexico, in California, and Arizona, and then Missouri, because Mark's going into Missouri now. Right. And he's also Nevada and Texas, Texas.
00:58:41 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We pulled out of Texas, actually.
00:58:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I marked it. That's why I did this. Texas, you don't mess with Texas for lots of reasons. I'll let you hop off, but I love that. I'll run that. Thank you for noticing time because I didn't. Anyway, take care.

Mappier commented as well. Do you know him? I know of him. Look, it's a road up. I don't know how good it sounds. it's Yeah. So, It's $100 like the Yeti mic and but it sounds way better. It sounds as good as the Shure SMB 7 or something like that. Yeah, I know I've heard good news. Yeah, but it's USB, not XLR and it doesn't need any and it can plug into your phone and it doesn't need anything.
00:01:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No cloudlifter not phone to yeah.
00:01:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so I mean, I like technology. I play around with a lot of things and because one of the things that I want to do is create some recordings that are like, you know, I was talking about some of the like inspirational, but also specifically calming, soothing to get frustrated. sometimes you hear something good that is specifically engineered towards getting us the energy that we want to have in business. Anyway, I think sound quality is important. So. but also I like shopping sometimes. Only online, not in person, do not like in-person shopping. I don't generally like shopping in general, but I do like the new technology thing that I would share that. Okay, so Neil, what I know about him is I got some of his stuff. He does like war reform products and...
00:02:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, I was just checking out his page. Looks like he's got a pretty slick thing for shorts and stuff. But yeah, I think he would be... I don't know that well, but I imagine it'd be a really good client too. think a lot of these people... Yeah, they need the combo. They need the combo. I think it's unique. I think we've hit something and then I think we should also create some kind of low ticket offer that leads into this for them as well.
00:02:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who leads into it? Yeah, because I was thinking yesterday about how do we serve people who can't afford this, aren't ready for it. don't know if you heard it. And I thought I left it in the message, but I'm pretty sleepy. So I was saying that it was around the Cory Michelle thing, too.
00:03:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was thinking, I think I did here, yeah, after that.
00:03:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I was like, there are going to be some people who are not ready for the investment. Oh, OK, it was when, because you were talking about 5,000 or 6,000. And I was saying, I think it should be 6,000. And I don't think that we should do less and that it's more about that price will match for the person who's ready for it. Like, this is really targeting a specific type of person. I put the requirements in the document. And that $6,000 should be fine for that person. Now, some people, especially that are already on your list, are or you're going to want to serve them and help them. And so the tendency is, like you were talking about that lady who had a sliding scale. I'm like, sliding scale will modify the offer, so we won't modify the price. So the offer can change, which changes the price, right? So you get a different version. It isn't one-on-one, but what you could have is maybe just the plan, like that it's more generic, and how we would come about the plan. So here's how we would come about the plan. We would ask you all of these questions, and we would look at all of the things that you have. And here's some examples of how we would package things together, right? you can apply this logic to whatever offerings you have. And then this is the business plan, and this is the logic that we use to come up with this business plan. So you can kind of formulate your own based off of what we did as examples. Now, if you want to say, hey, Here's what I came up with is this is a good idea and have vox or access to us. Here is our $200 a month coaching or $400 month code, like whatever the vox or access would be. Yeah. And then, you know, maybe a call a week or two calls a month where you can come in and you could get like hot seat reviews, that type of thing.
00:05:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Um, so it's okay.
00:05:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Way cheaper. And it's along the same line. So we're staying in our lane, right? And which means that we'll get the testimonials and the referrals that we get will all be concentrated around the offer that we have, which, so all the traction, all the energy that we get, it will all be relative, which means that, that anybody coming to us should be hot and targeted, right?
00:05:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I love that idea. Like I was just going to say, that's sort of a little bit like, um, what do you call it? Alan Sotanic, what I pay 500 a month for, once a week he does a call, he's got the forum, right? But he doesn't do chat support or voxer support, but he's sort of in discord answering some people everywhere as well. And then on his three, four hour calls on Thursdays, you could ask a question. Um, so, so I do like that concept of what you're talking about, like you're thinking, because these people are excited and they don't, um, you call it qualify.
00:06:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what else can we give them? Is that kind of where?
00:06:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes.
00:06:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'll tell you what I like about this court is you can do audio recordings and replies and video recording and replies. then it's a, it's a chat and generally the people that are in discord are either active or they're completely negative not which is there's not a bunch of just but they're coming there for a purpose so they're either talking to each other or they're completely out of it because they don't like it and they only go in for you send them email here's the content so this is another option and thing to be because of the clips specifically the audio interaction.
00:07:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well yeah and what's interesting so you know is the discord what Alan does on his $20,000 mess run that I joined last year he will do a loom video for the feedback and he'll just give you the loom link so that's kind of cool as well.
00:07:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah and I would totally be willing to do that too but I don't want to do that for like a $200 offer of 400 or 500 would yeah so what are we really talking about them because like for me and I can just
00:08:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
open up Google and we can just start writing because the auditory I won't remember but if I open up Google Doc. So, well actually why don't we do a customer map? What's your customer map? File, we'll make a copy in our position. So, so technically we have like let's just call it high ticket, right? Right? Technically we have this one for the pocket CMO, right?
00:08:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me zoom in bigger. Want me to share this with you as well right now or do I want to wait? That would be great but I'm good with watching you while we do this though.
00:09:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I said in the Google background, if you saw that change to 12K in 2025. I love that. Yeah, six people.
00:09:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then we have to back that up and do that, and then I think that we could change the 12K also to 12 months and maybe also put in like a call once a quarter or something like that so that the value is stacked a little bit more.
00:09:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so what you're saying, so repeat kind of what you're thinking here, I was thinking like a full on low ticket funnel, but you were saying something else. It's like a lower fee subscription.
00:10:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I was saying, like, and I wouldn't really want to offer this until after we've done a couple of these because it would give us the framework to make that so much easier. But basically, they would get the same thing, but it would be a do-it-yourself version. So here is because what we're going to do is we're going to take a survey form that is thorough. It's basically an intake form that gets all this information from people. And from that intake form, we're going to figure out all the assets that they have and the skills and abilities that they have and formulate an offer stack for them, right? Front and like a low ticket, mid ticket, high ticket, if possible, and different types of offers and packaging that they can give and not necessarily that they should offer all of them, giving them some options. and showing them how they could package their products slash services differently. And in order to just have something, first of all, that's scalable, potentially. So potentially low ticket, mid ticket, high ticket, potentially something that is recurring, but it really depends on who they are and what they're offering. That doesn't work for everybody. But that's what we'll be looking at is what is the best way to leverage, whatever is that you have to offer to people. And then, do you want me to finish the?
00:11:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Try and thought, yeah, yeah.
00:11:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, so are you talking about what is the low ticket? So then the other thing would be we're going to create a business plan and say, here's the strategy that we would go about for you to make sure that you're not overextending yourself, like minimum viable product, really laser-targeted marketing using existing organic traffic. them. Coming up with the most leveraged business plan that they could have to mitigate loss and maximize profits. So that is very custom. That's what we're offering to people who's going to be talking to us one on one, which is a little bit more detail than I've given in the past, but since we've talked about this. But what this front end version could be is like here's examples of what we've done. We're not doing this for you, but we're going to show you our logic and we're going to give you these case studies or examples, right? So that you can put your own stuff through it and come up with a plan on your own and try to apply what was done because you can't afford it, or whatever reason, just choose not to invest in us on a higher level. But if you want support doing that, if you want some feedback, if you want to be able to get some help with it. And again, still don't want to pay the $6,000 price, then you can join our monthly group and you can quit anytime you want to. There's no commitment. So let's just say you want to come in and ask a bunch of questions. Then you get access to us for $400 a month. You can ask questions. You can, we'll have two live calls a month and it can be a couple hours long and bring your stuff, ask your questions. So that's still so it could be the front end is here's how we did it. Here's the framework, $97. The next upsell was if you want support while you came up with it, if you want feedback on your plan, if you want us to look at it and see how we would tweak it, adjust it, then you can come into the membership group for whatever $400 a month. And we'll give you feedback and if we're giving good feedback and it's going to take you what a launch that I imagine you're going to save for a few months, right? That's not enough you want to get there faster and you want us to really plan it out if you want access to a roll of X and who we would hire for this type of thing then it's the $6,000 one.
00:14:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I still can't visualize picture of the front end same thing but do it yourself version. Here's how we did it.
00:14:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's how you can model it. So you won't probably until we've done it for somebody and I was just about to say maybe we need to run through the client stuff and you know see most of you all but so yeah it'll look kind of. kind of like our calculators. like you've got the the funnels like right you've got that. So they would be able to get one of those and plug their stuff into it. I have a different version of things and we would have an outline of maybe it's a Trello board like a project suite that says because we can share Trello boards people can copy them and this would be stage one stage two stage three kind of thing or maybe copy just graphics development all the different moving pieces and create them into tasks that they would then you know modify but they at least have a framework and we could put etas of how long this type of task should be should take to do so really break down the whole cycle into actual task and in actual project management suite that they just import and so let's say they get a developer they just assign those tasks to their developer and maybe instead of school they're using circle or Facebook groups or whatever so they modify a couple of things but for the most part it's gonna be pretty duplicatable. I think that's super high value and I'd be okay with giving that away for $97 because I think we want to over-deliver below them away with everything that we do and basically prove like how much we know and understand and how valuable we are so because at some point they're gonna go this takes way too long even with all the amazing tools that we give them they're like I want more help and that's that's what we want is we want them to be sold on how helpful we are so that we're not trying to you know we don't have to work for sales calls they should basically be begging to work with us because they know what we know, they know where they answer and they're happy to give us their money. It completely changes the energy and the dynamic of their relationship versus when you go in like and somebody hires you and they're like okay prove to me you're worth my money.
00:17:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah yeah so yeah like we had like for my car for magic we have like I'm just going to share screen or show this we had a product called high ticket toolkit as well and it had like yeah four calculators crush your launch creating proper headache offers easy but and then we had a whole excel or csv so where they could just import into a sauna and have like all the tasks they have to do like
00:18:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I actually have a base camp project template that I use for my freedoms, huh?
00:18:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:18:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That I used to use for my freedom systems and if I, let me see if I can find it in my drive, I use a new project template, let me share screen with you for a second, is that okay? So this actually came from, this came from starting with building Ryan Moran's Shear Strength Labs, the 12 months to a million bucks you wrote. So, um, Well, let's see, project discovery, that's a whole new thing, right, is kind of defining the avatar. These are, these would be tasks that you start with, conversations that have to be had, meetings, exploration on the team. Like, it depends on who you're at, but if you're doing this for your, as your agent agency, then you're doing it for a client and you're doing it with them. So, and the note is here, remove any items that are not applicable to the funnel, but what we'll do is have it where it's, you know, project suite specific and just be able to export from one to another. But these things, right, define what it is, title was the price, who's responsible for creating the content. So, like, if the copywriter has one part, the graphic designer has another part, that type of thing. sometimes before you even get to the copywriter, you have to give. of product-specific information, so then it's kind of three part, right, because it's the product owner who has to inform the copywriter, and then the graphic designer should be entitled what they want, and generally the copywriter probably is going to inform that if they're really good at marketing and you're hiring a copywriter. Due date, stages, dependency tasks, things like that. Yeah. core offer up sales, that admin instruction tasks, labeling base camp tasks properly, creating client project folder and Google Drive, creating the following sub-folders, all these things for approvals.
00:20:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
There's a lot. So you can like make some like this, but in Trello, so it looks really pretty, people go all about it from a marketing perspective?
00:20:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And also, this could be a PDF that is broken down a little bit more and explained a little bit more, dressed up and made pretty. um, um, explain with some videos, like this could be a product all in and of itself. Um, I was going in a totally different direction.
00:21:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was going more, um, the front end, like a true low ticket funnel, like more about the end result, getting them on, whether it be go high level or system I owe, so that they become a customer that way. Like, so, so for instance, like, the thing could be a 37 or $27 in $14, like a lot of Alan's tannic students are making, you know, multi-million dollar low ticket files and they're using a $14.40 price. But I could be, we have to figure out who our avatar is on this one, but like, so for instance, it could be just one around, um, you know, here's like, just to get them hooked is that, you know, here's like, whatever, five years of winning Facebook ad formulas and actual ads that have helped me build to million dollar funnels. You could have this and even if it's five bucks, right? And then when they get that, say, you know, the thing that made it work, though, is a really good funnel software as well, besides the copy and everything. And so the next page, bump can be like, get all of our snapshots or templates, you know, here's some examples of some winning, you know, know, pages. I mean, that's what Anac Sentinel did. Like he at low ticket funnels. He's not the expert at it, but he just claimed ourselves a frickin' expert because he saw all the money in being a go-high level affiliate, right? So he bolted on front end to make a boatload of money on it. Like, there's sort of a joker down to 10x thing going. This guy never even made a million off of a lot things in funnel. Now he's like, but he's doing it. He's getting away with it. And of course, he's a great guy. He sells other stuff about information products. That's good. But uh, but anyways, so I was going around that angle, like, yeah.
00:22:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You made me think of something now. So that's type of organization, that is what I've inserted into every company that has become a million dollar company that wasn't before I got there.
00:23:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So how do we, and I'm not going to have the answer right now, and maybe you haven't, but how do you make that ? Because when I looked at it, my eyes glossed over little bit because I'm creative, right?
00:23:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the results are what ?
00:23:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
The work is not .
00:23:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a saying that says something um, looks like work and dressed like overall success, something like that is success. Looks like work, dressed in overalls. I don't remember what it is. Hold on a second. Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.
00:23:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I love that quote.
00:23:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's the thing is I am not going to if you like sucking your thumb, we are not going to work.
00:24:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
part together, right? If you're looking for passification, if you, I'm an I am a fast twitch explosive kind of person.
00:24:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I cannot sit still for long. If you're and now I am also like, I used to think I was lazy because I was always looking for the shortcuts. I'm not lazy, but I get bored easily. And I want to do lots of things. And I want to feel that explosive energy. So I gamify everything. There is no faster, easier way to do and to grow than what I've created. Because if there were, I wouldn't go into companies and have their mind blown every time. just that is why it's a fundamental like a lever is the most basic kind of tool you have a fulcrum. like a rock and a plank and the lifting power is exponential based on the size of the lever. It is as simple as it gets. You still have to do the lifting. You don't have to get the pull from. You still have to get the lever. It still works. But the power that you can do once you understand the lever and you do it, is amazing. Let's imagine that this guy is like, I can't do this job because I got to hire five guys to lift this big old thing and Joe blow up over here and he's tiny. like, I got you $25 and he brings out a rock and a stick and he gets it done by himself. That's magical. He's blowing the mind of these early dudes and five of them do it and it was so much more expensive. That is the power of working smarter or harder. Everybody tells you to do it. Nobody tells you how to do it. This is how how you do it. So it isn't . The work isn't . The results are . So, you know, you have to decide if you want front or back, but you don't get both.
00:26:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because if it's on the front, which means I don't do any work, you're not going to get big results.
00:26:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're not going to get big profits. You're not going to have a great company. You're not going on the front. You actually are smart and you do some of the work and you're organized and structured. Guess what you get on the back end? All this .
00:26:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And you get to keep it.
00:26:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm not trying to convince somebody and try to sell them and let them hear what they want to hear. If you want to go buy a diet pill instead of go to the gym, I'm not a person. If you want to go buy a lottery ticket to make your money, I'm not your person. And I want to be very clear about that. Yeah. But what I will tell you is. I've got the best plan for the gym. And I literally, Maria, for real, I go to the gym, I spend about 15 minutes, I do a leg press, and I do this one movement overhead. But it works. of those movements get all of my core.
00:27:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm sore from head to toe. My daughter went with me, she's like, that's crazy.
00:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My strength grows every week. I can lift more. only do it every couple of weeks. I have lost size. I don't eat less. I don't like, I'm not, you know, tiny or anything, but the power of that, and I found somebody else that explained it, but I have way less pain. I sleep better. I have more energy because I'm not exhausting myself going to the gym, building up cortisol. I still go to the gym. I'm just going to the gym way less and more powerfully than most people are doing.
00:27:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And it's the same thing in business.
00:27:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm doing. Project management like other people, but I'm precision about it and I'm getting the most out of the least every single time. So like, that's how you make it is that, you know, it is work, but it's the least amount of work that you can do to get the greatest amount of results. If you're not looking for great results, then this isn't for you.
00:28:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So, so, um, yeah, and essentially because if I look at my most successful companies, there's no doubt that at the beginning stages is because whether it be me or someone else, we had a really good project management or just more than that, everything you talked about because I remember I had base camp and even for every private client then that came to me, I actually put them on base camp and they had their separate workspace just for that, you know, um, so yeah. interesting, interesting. So I'm just trying to think and train of thought. And I might just have a bias that I need to remove. You know, the famous guy wrote the book Pay Yourself First, Profit First.
00:29:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know that guy?
00:29:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Profit First, yes. He was a client. Yeah, he was a client of Emily Hershey's and there was another very famous guy like that in that same area too. Like a lot about like a little bit about what you're talking about too. And we never could get ads to work for them. Like it just wasn't at the beginning that to teach them that. lot of people were like, yeah, but I get it. So yeah, it's just not coming to me with that front end would be though what we call it and all that. But you're right.
00:30:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Maybe we just
00:30:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
need to do it a couple of times for some clients first.
00:30:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I mean, we could call it a profit accelerator. It could be a business accelerator because accelerating is what it is, but it's also sustainable growth. So this is one of the biggest reasons I haven't created stuff because coming up with a hook is hard. That's where the longevity and the long play comes in, right? So people who are already familiar who just know, like this off, when you did a pocket CMO and COO, that created an immediate, there was an image that they could draw. They know what a CMO is, they know what a pocket is. They can imagine, I've got access, OK, that's actually really clear while still being incredibly ambiguous. Yeah, yeah. But they drew the picture in their own mind. So, using language that allows a person to fill in the blanks and draw the picture in their own mind is what we want to do, right? So, we want to allow them to draw the conclusions like, that's why we have words like blueprints and toolkits and accelerator that have been used in IM for, the beginning, blueprints gives you an instant thing, like, you know, like, that is the schematics, that is the line, that is everything top to bottom, you know, you like, I got to get work done, that's the thing, accelerator, all of these types of things, they, know what they mean, even if we don't know exactly the way that they would apply to work, and we don't even know that the person that's selling it actually.
00:32:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
actually has anything good.
00:32:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it a good toolbox or did you step from the dollar store? Like, you know, the power and the results are different. Is it a good blueprint or did you have a really bad architect and there are things missing and the measurements are off? assume that everything with those words are good. Yeah, that's what they were created for, but it doesn't. And so the value is a tied to that particular word less so than the actual product that's being sold.
00:32:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Does that make sense? Yeah, it does. It does.
00:32:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It does. can find that type of word for any of these offers that conjures up an image in a person's mind of the power. And by the way, it's a leverage power. So the leverage of a blueprint is clarity. know step by step what I have to do. leverage of a toolkit is is that when I have to put a name, into the wood. I know I have to do it, but how am I going to do it? I need the right tool, right? So that implies that I'll have what I need to accomplish the work. Accelerator means that it's going to go faster than it would if I didn't get this. It's an implied leverage to each of and they automatically kind of fill in the blanks of the value.
00:33:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah. There's someone just message me that I know a little bit not super well, but pretty well from another group. She was there for the program. She just messaged me. This is include implementation of the marketing plan. I said no, but if I was consulting on it, as you implement it in team to hire and more, team is behind the scenes expert behind hugely names like that of scale, like Dan Meredith, and you can pop on a comment with me and Tina if you want.
00:33:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll just see what she was. But yeah, you would even say, don't know if they know him, but Ryan Moran of capitalism.com Yeah, 12 months to $1 million because I'll say that should name of capitalism.com. Yeah. He also has an event called Capcom every year. He gets Damon John. He gets lots of big people.
00:34:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
what's this book?
00:34:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's the book called? Pretty sure it's 12 months to him. Your first year, right? that. Yep, Ryan Moran, Ryan, Daniel Moran, 12 months to $1 million. Not that he bothered acknowledging me.
00:34:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And the fact that we put it in base camp.
00:34:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, did all of that. And I was.
00:34:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Where's. She said, I don't need marketing strategy.
00:34:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For me, it's all about the integration at this point. Another word people call me is integrator When rocket fuel came out and that word came out that was like two people like you're an integrator. That's what you are Tina Is everybody likes labels?
00:35:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I Think because everyone knows me as marketing they're assuming it's marketing yet.
00:35:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I thought the docket was pretty clear about Operations and team and stuff that is interesting Yeah, so then maybe giving a background of who I am and what I've done and that like if they've ever read Traction or rocket fuel that I am the integrator for several seven and eight-figure businesses or have been. Do I have it?
00:36:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, we'll see what she says. She's been planning with me for the last three months, so I don't know if she'll pull the trigger because I don't know what she's just shopping around and cheap, I'm just gonna say that. Because then when I say playing, I mean, asking me questions too in Facebook questions or before being paid a dollar for stuff, right? but that is a perfect example where I find that fascinating. And maybe we just need to get more you and I together on video, Tina, because it is like even the product boss, how do they really get to one million? besides my marketing strategy, I had them hire an integrator as their first hire, right? You know. Oh, because, yeah, that I just like, oh, sorry.
00:37:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is what Matt said, um, just to make a correlation to things that people actually can know and do some research on. So he doesn't say share certain lives, but I get results. She came into our company when we were having some growing pains and needed help cleaning up our systems. that point, we were doing a few hundred thousand per month. Fast forward 12 months and we've increased our revenue 10 fold. Tina played a huge part and helping us do this. Robert released. took our ideas and visions and made them a reality. And we couldn't have grown this fast without her. Okay. So Matt, this is the partner of, oh, I'm not sharing that part of my screen. Sorry, stop sharing, share. Um, really not good.
00:37:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. What I can do is in the Google doc or if you want to, you can just put in some screenshots of more people, but this is all good feedback, by the way, right? To show, Hey, here's behind the scenes of these people, right? Um, I just know, um, like even Karina, how she got to me, she got disgusted with someone else. She paid 5k for. She didn't say the name. forget was, but this is like three, four years ago. She I bought it because included in her program was a, was a business plan. I really wanted the business plan, but the girls program didn't lead with that. The girls program was probably something like the 10k a month program, like it led with something like that. But the business plan was boiler template and she was so mad. And the coaches weren't the guru. It was $25 an hour. People she had hired, you know, so she was just like, ah, so, um, anywho, uh, yeah, um, I wonder.
00:38:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dan's always offering to share stuff for me, but he's also doing his own thing. So I don't know. I talked to my guy too, because they're business partners. Um, My guy is who got Dan Meredith to do, to even be recognizable at all. So I'm Dan's first coach that he ever hired. And then because we worked together, I introduced him to my guy who has, you know...
00:39:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hold on, I'm just want to make sure that Kat's not pinging so much.
00:39:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
on. Okay.
00:39:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, it's okay. No, I think she must have just been playing with something, but you know when Kat kind of do the scratch, scratch, before they go pee? Yeah. So that's what I was worried so no I think she must have just been trying to get a spider or something in the corner.
00:39:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That we might be able to get more. for eyeballs on it from a group that is familiar with me.
00:40:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
what I do is what I was saying. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I also think maybe Friday, instead of a webinar and all that stuff, we're trying to figure out. Maybe it's you and I doing just a true podcast style interview. We're just talking to each other and I'll just say, Tina, why is having systems so important? And we just we have a little bit of a structure, but it's really just us talking saying, hey, we're doing this video because some of you may not know me or you, Tina, then we both share it with our audiences, something like that. Because my people, I think they're so used to me being, I'm just going to say, at low price and do stuff for them.
00:40:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like remember the last offer was $2,000.
00:40:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'll create the whole front end. So I think they're having sticker shock, right? eight um so potentially because she hasn't um she said send me a link and i'll and i'd love to talk to you you too this is this on a girl amanda but uh amanda who hines hines she does wholesaling she's in my laurel portay seven dollar month ads group that i'm in um and uh so uh uh i'm definitely open to it send me a link to discuss and i can match it to my availability so um yeah i think i'll just have to send her a link to when you and i are available to to talk to us but uh i i don't want to fight from the business either oh i won't yeah so so it's like you know she's already trying to position herself you know i mean um so versus like i can just put up and nothing held back now like hey five hundred dollar run out of her one hour our strategy cash injection plan with me. So just to piece, you know, for the next week for casual, but I don't want to fight for her. Like, you know, she doesn't see the value. I'm not going to, you know, yeah.
00:42:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I didn't even do like a one-on-one call. So here's the thing. What I would say is if you want to do a call with us, first you have to fill out the form. Okay, like I told you before, you don't get to talk to me unless you're qualified to talk to me. And if you aren't, if you need to be convinced, go convince yourself or I'll find somebody else, but I don't, you're not worried about you.
00:42:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah.
00:42:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where I'm coming from is that all fairness, all these people don't know who you are, right? No, that's okay, but I'm saying for you too. Like, you don't need to be worried about them. So if they need to be sold on you, but for your time, like your one-on-one time, even... or like a sales call, look, before, because you don't want to sell somebody who's not qualified.
00:43:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, they just call it like, yeah, you know, she makes enough and all that. Yeah, yeah, because I'm in the same group, Laurel. That's why she wanted to hire me for ads because her low ticket funnel is really done well. She's done well and she sells a low ticket funnel on how to do wholesale real estate investing. And it's done really well. But she's still not the ideal perfect avatar, don't think, because the other ain't danger.
00:43:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is a good conversation we're having because who we want to really help.
00:43:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. The other day, just having someone who just started making money online and just, you know, started to have success with their funnel. So, they're going to be very, most of them, unless they've run real business before with people and stuff, they could be very, probably how you disrupt court and show. They could be very like, just like, yeah, you know what I mean? just, you know. Needy or cheap or whatever and so like you like like the perfect avatar and obviously he's a friend So he wouldn't do it right wouldn't make sense to be my friend Derby right who's run many companies He's in his early 50s or late 40s probably 50. Yeah, no, he's definitely was 50s. think but you know He's already made millions of dollars in the past. He's also lost it but he hasn't really Stuck with something he's a little bit like me So he wasted 25 grand on Russell Bronson's circle thing about two years ago Why did you buy that and then now he's struck it rich again because he's always striking rich He'll always keep trying stuff. He's making about 40,000 a month or recurring from his Airbnb He converted one of his apartment village in New Jersey It was like eight unit into Airbnb's and he's now making grants making 35 to 40 grand a from like 15 years ago doing SEO consulting for local businesses And he's still getting $500 checks from businesses from 12 years ago. So he has a funnel I created for him last year for it. And it was doing pretty good. But he got frazzled because he was trying to do everything.
00:45:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Those are the perfect people that that's who needs me the most. Because I think I've experienced a little bit how quickly I can focus you. And so instead of like you, you still are thinking about other things, but you're staying in a lane and you're not letting it. So you're not doing the things at the cost of what's most important. That's generally what people do. And so I can literally just a text message, a boxer message, whatever, very short thing, get somebody anchored. So like my attorney's wife, my client who's an attorney hired me for his wife. And she is a nurse practitioner, but there's a business opportunity in community. and helping organize things and structure things. But she's never operated like this before. She is not native to America. She doesn't speak English, but it's not her native tongue. There's a lot of things that she's frustrated with, but she's very smart and she's very capable. And so she's had some issues that have kept her from doing the things that she needs to do. In simple text messages that took me five minutes to write, she shifted and shifted immediately and for the rest of the time. then so once a week I just text her, see how she's doing. She tells me the things that's stressing her out. give her a quick little, it's like an inspirational message. But it's tactical. It's like, this is what's happening. This is why it's happening. So now that you know it's happening and you're conscious of it, now you know why it's happening and you're conscious of it. Here's a strategy that should work according to what I know about your personality that you can implement. And then they get buy-in because they say... you're right, I will do X and now in a matter of minutes, something that because there was no clarity, they weren't conscious of it. They weren't clearly conscious of it. They weren't conscious of the cost to them or a tactic to stop the thing from happening. Yes, I can give that to people in minutes. So, you know, having a conversation about that, teaching people and that gets back to jeans, shorts, levels of awareness, right? What do you call that? don't know, but I know it exists and I know it can find it and I know it can be fulfilled. Yeah. Technically, I think that's what, like, so I've never called myself a business coach. Other people call me business coach. I hate it. I've said consultant, operation manager, project manager, like operations consultant, but I get called business coach.
00:47:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
People just call me coach. Hey coach. Hey coach.
00:48:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need that yeah, and it's because you know, it's it's strategy. It's tactics but it's also look you need to do this you need to do that and and it's not a specific thing right it's business related so if you hire a soccer coach soccer coach might tell you how to eat might tell you how to think might tell you to get to bed on time I tell you it's a homework done so you're it's not in your head might tell you all kinds of things it has nothing to do with soccer per se yeah impact your game so the same thing with business coaching is you know but there are a lot of crowd people out there and there's not a lot that can do what I do and then there might be people who like well if she's so good why is she just doing this well because my priorities mom I'm serving the mission I'm going to school I'm not out here trying to get a yacht I'm just living my life and help you along the way so that's an uphill battle because people have scripts in their head about what people look like what successful people look like and that kind of thing. So anyway, that's all the stuff that we're dealing with. But once you start to get testimonials and come up with a particular name that has that word that conjures up something, right, like blue kit and blueprint, like toolkit, things like that.
00:49:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
if we get some names for that particular offer where they're like, this is what happened, this was amazing and they tell them Yeah, like really, when you think about it, and it might just be people just need more exposure as well. It's sort of a bit like the strategic coach. I think I mentioned that guy to you before. He's in Canada and like Scott Alford hires him, like a lot of people work at steel hires him. Let me see, like a lot people already making a lot of money, know, or , got to hire this guy because I don't have a life after I've, you know, done. I'm so well in my business, so let's see all these things, or if anything to Dan Sullivan, that's it, that's just a DJ coach, this guy, I mean they don't go in implement for people, like they're like, yeah, you know, Dan Sullivan, as in like the class, like the marketer and copywriter, like that's been around for decades business. He's picture of this guy.
00:50:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know what he looks like, but yeah, no, no, I'm sharing screen right now.
00:50:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know, I still don't know what Dan Sullivan looks like. Oh, got you got you got it.
00:50:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, but yeah, he's on par with Dan Kennedy and a lot of ways in terms of like how long he's been around and, and yeah, so. Business strategy is definitely a huge part of what I offer and do But I don't have a brand and I don't have you know a pedigree.
00:51:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So You're also not paying his prices. We have results. We have the results. Yeah, okay, so Other than that where were we so And that's just one person, right?
00:51:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's plenty of other people that I just said the Google Doc too So I'm interested in in talking to Neil and seeing I mean I don't know what or your forum stuff and I don't know how he organizes his business. So I Don't know enough, but I know that he knows a lot about business I know he knows a lot about the market. So if he's interested in it, I would imagine there's I Know some need not being met for him and I'd be curious what what sparked his curiosity in it.
00:51:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hmm.
00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And one of the other conversations to start having is, like, raise your hand if you've heard of rocket fuel and raise your hand if you've heard of an integrator, like, has anybody looked at that go? I wish I had an integrator. Well, that's what Tina is, and that type of thing, because again, it's a correlation to something that they already have a definition for in their head, and they've already attached a value to it if they're familiar with it. So, by translation, by saying this integrator thing that you've already got, and it's established about saying she's that, and she's been doing it for these companies to go, oh, wait a minute, okay, I could have access to that, like, and Maria's standing, like, working with her, so Maria must think that that's useful and good. You could even tell any, like, if you have anything to share about anything that you feel like I brought value to you for, like, you will imagine. And we were just talking we weren't even like I didn't hire anything, but just in talking Yeah, I felt this did this and this is how I feel about it now and because not everything is going to be a like it's going to be an indirect financial game, so We had a conversation about your center and your values and I didn't say anything about Karina, but you Took what was said and you knew like this is where I'm stuck right now I'm not doing what I should be doing and I need to make a change. didn't know that I you knew that but I Facilitated a thought in your head that made that happen with clarity for you and then you went and did that and and that's the type of thing It's very difficult to explain how that happens unless you've had the experience. Yeah, yeah-hmm But you've been on fire since you let that weight go
00:54:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, I know, I know, it gets down a little bit because that later I had to finish that 2K Final Four, which still burns me because she paid the 2K on Thursday and Friday and so Karina got like 1200 of the 2K and the next day Karina's like, I don't think this partnership is working, you know. I met with her today to go over her customer journey and everything, hey, this is almost done. She, so this is digital products, right, think she's going to do really well because she does well on Etsy selling some of these digital planners for co-parenting custody and productivity for months. And then she goes, well, no, I'm going to buy Karina's $5,000 one-on-one coaching site because I want to stick with, I want to also grow my e-com store because I started with her. I'm just like, oh, . She's never going to make that back. She's been with Karina for over six months and she's only broken even, you know.
00:54:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I their lessons.
00:54:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
had to learn yours. That's true. theirs. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So I was just like, I really was shocked because, um, yeah, I, like, because she thought I could run her traffic for her for like really cheap, she goes, oh, next week we start traffic for this. So wait, that's not not in scope for the 2K, you know, and so I, I was just like, if you want that, I could still honor the traffic package I offered a while ago for, for people if it was just one campaign and managing the ad spend is $1,000 a month, which is like it should be like 3K month.
00:55:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so anyway, uh, your effective hourly rate should never be less than 500. You, Maria specifically, know, shouldn't be less than 500. So I need you to engrade that, engrain that in your head, um, because that's the result you get. So if somebody is not qualified to pay that or doesn't want to pay that, that conversation can end very quickly and it's okay.
00:55:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes. Well, exactly. And I think the issue has been because I've been around Crena's crowd, right? These are all people who who just barely can make paying the shop if I'm not paying You know what you should do is you should write a pedigree post.
00:56:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is my history. This is who I am. This is what I've done. And for a little while I've been playing small. You don't have to say anything about it. Now this is not to say I don't believe in low ticket funnels. I do. I think that there's a lot of value in it, but because I think because I've seen them grow you know million dollar per year or whatever businesses, but I want to be very clear that I am not a low ticket person. This is the value. This is what I bring to the table. And somehow sometimes people make a correlation between the low price of an offer and the low price of time with me and let me make sure that you understand that they're not the same thing.
00:56:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love that. Because it's not your results speak for themselves.
00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah and it's maybe or even rethink having the school group as free like I'm tempted just to put a you know whether five buck a month or 47 bucks a month on it right now because I notice it's attracting a lot of people as well that are uh do you want to do you want to turn that into something we do together we can split the school price and just start go let's go create let's start having conversations in there every week um we can have a couple every week if you want to and just go like gangbusters on learning them but them learning us because there's no way we start talking and people show up and they're not going to get that really smart I went to traffic conversions one time and Richard Linder was not a partner yet and he was teaching email stuff and I'd been managing email list for a while and I knew a lot about deliverability and sender score this was 13 years ago almost 12 years ago people didn't know this then um but I did because our emails weren't getting through and I needed to figure out why because that was costing us a lot of money and I don't like losing money. By the way, while getting paid $15 an hour to turn a company into a million dollar company and going bankrupt while getting divorced, like I got some issues. Anyway, so I kept asking questions and he's like, you're really smart, aren't you? then I walked out of that room and I could hear people pointing at me whispering about how smart I was in digital marketing. So this isn't about arrogance, it's a point like I stand out even in crowds of smart people. There are a few that I get around and I'm just like, they're their brilliance and I see that they do a lot of what I do but they're also very quiet. They're not out there doing big things like big things publicly privately. There is many like eight figures, seven, eight and nine figure businesses and they're the masterminds behind it that nobody knows about. But when you hear them talk, you know, yeah, you're like that, but you've been, you focus on the marketing so much. But when you talk about strategy, people are like, holy crap, every single time, but yeah, well, that's why Emily hers hired me to be the strategy director. Yeah, like it was I never heard of her until one of my clients hired her, but then they went back and because they undid everything she did because ultimately it didn't work for them.
00:59:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah, she was I don't know if she's changed now, but back then she was pretty bad.
00:59:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like it was like two years ago.
00:59:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, really? Oh, well, then it's just she grew too fast and like some of the ads managers are really good. So it's maybe some bad. But yeah, for her, basically, then a strategy director, I would be helping like not helping that be crafting the strategy for Amy Porterfield, Mary Forley, I look at Gabby Burstein, those were her clients, right?
01:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know that.
01:00:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. Um, I think she still has those clients.
01:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She kept in the referral because she started. you that's, that should be part of your, like your pedigree.
01:00:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
01:00:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Seriously, Maria, just spend like the next week riding down the, the who's who, the stories, the money, the whatever. That should be a whole thing. Because the next time somebody is like, well, you know, it'd be like, hold on, go take a read down and then make it done.
01:00:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, I think that's good. So, and, and then, so, yes, a member I suggested maybe we just share school group. So I think the freebie group, even though they say that's good, was like having a free Facebook group, because school, the nature of school, you're getting a lot of people who just want to spam others. We always have to keep spam. if we make it 10 bucks a month or five bucks a month, it'll keep those people out and it could become like a newsletter alternative.
01:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or we decided. So that was one of the things I was thinking about with the community. is rather than email because you also can email, but only like once a week or three times a week, something like that. I don't remember. Once a day school, you can't. So if you do a post, you can email that out. It will send an email notification to people, but there's a limitation to three days. Okay. Yeah. So that's fine. But either way, putting out content like that, right? So rather than not instead of email, but in addition to for people who don't necessarily want email, but they like the groups and they like socializing. But yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:01:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So what do you think? We could always just keep increasing it every month, maybe five bucks for this month, 10 bucks next month, 15 next month, or do you think we just go right to 27 a month?
01:01:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, we could just go with the dollar. So we keep people there and then say, okay, month, and let's go just add value.
01:01:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So we immediately stop the spammers because you have to put in a credit card, right? Correct. Yeah, they affiliate markers and I'm I'm pretty sure we should be able to convert a free school community into a paid Yeah, you can you can and obviously we can we can just call this digital marketing or something like we don't I again. I never claimed the URL because we could change it whatever we want so Yeah Well that guy looks good and I don't let in people they don't have Anything you know what I mean and I'm almost almost tempted to not like guys in anymore Cuz all the free onboarding calls I've had that I stopped now the good ones were with the females But the guys just said just want to pure like what about this? about this? about this here?
01:02:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, it wasn't enjoyable the energy was different Maybe just a business acceleration because it's not just marketing. We're going to be talking about everything business acceleration strategies or Something like that
01:03:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, yeah, looks like we can do that.
01:03:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
01:03:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I'm making a buck right now.
01:03:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Five bucks, 10 bucks, whatever you feel like just. So people that don't pay it. I don't know how that works. Like, do they get to stay?
01:03:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know what happens, but. No, they all get grandfathered in.
01:03:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay.
01:03:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, so if you do month and annually. they do five bucks a month for the year, usually five months. Five times five is 55, 55 for the year. 8%.
01:03:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just can't wait. Five times too long. Yeah, because otherwise it'd be 65.
01:03:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
01:03:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Whoa.
01:03:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, okay. Yeah. Yeah. So instead of 55, it's not making a 40. I just want to make it five months worth. Five bucks gets seven months free. But how do I. . Oh, that's. Yeah. All right. I think it just means that these people are free and the rest have to pay five bucks, I think.
01:04:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

Yeah. I'm so tired. But it's awful. She comes back and she's so happy and I really think that that extra fortification. I'm a convert and so I didn't have any that I didn't do any church until I was 19 and none of my other girls finish at one. Two of them dabbled and then just dropped out very quickly, but I think this one is going to stick it out. So yeah, I'm hoping Maybe hopefully I'm the only member in my family besides my girls Yeah, I did well. I did early early morning seminary and I dropped off for a few years and I came back so yeah Yeah, I gotta take that journey, but I don't I don't know. Oh, that's my CPA. I need to turn that around I don't know. Yeah, I think I probably would have done it. I did jazz choir at seven So it would only have been an hour early and I always wanted to escape home. So I probably would have won it And I had stamina back then stamina. Oh man, I don't know. That is anymore Um, oh, I was opening litify refresh. I wonder patrick remembers You can chat and really quick Yeah, I'll just text them real quick Yeah, do I have it? Is that your number? Hold on. I thought I saved you guys when we sent exchanged numbers. But I don't, I didn't say it has full number apparently. Yes, would you please? I'm going to go find out the emails that email with your numbers.
00:02:27 - Lorenz Schuerch
He's in the waiting room apparently.
00:02:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It doesn't tell me. It doesn't show him. He is probably in the wrong one, the old meeting.
00:02:59 - Lorenz Schuerch

Hey, Tina.
00:04:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you? Good.
00:04:15 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
How are you doing? Good.
00:04:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How do you say your last name? Okay. Okay. I didn't, I wasn't paying attention to way the highest. Well, then I'm making sure I have you both in my phone in case we have any other issues in your calendar invitation. Do you have the right link? Yeah. Okay. Just wanted to make sure because when I updated it for Mark, I. Thought I updated the link and then I did not put the right one in there. So I didn't save it. I did actually do it. I just forgot. completed properly. All right, how are my guys doing today?
00:05:06 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Good finally got a settlement after six days.
00:05:13 - Lorenz Schuerch
That's nerve wracking, huh?
00:05:15 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I know I was like, dude, what the is going on?
00:05:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
we did an F bomb, but I am said. We'll let it slide this time. Let's let this on.
00:05:29 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Let me go get these numbers equals last quarter.
00:05:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
want where we at right now. We're still beginning of September. Just kind of see how everybody's doing. So tell me about the holy heck. I just looked at the video seconds. just think it's big. What am I? looking at.
00:05:51 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
That's what people can.
00:05:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was funny. I'm usually looking at my screen and not video, so that's Oh, this is funny. Okay, so I'm in Lettify looking at September. Mark, you know what? have a meeting with him next week. I'll yell at him about stats for you guys. see, he always tells me I'm doing something busy. Got this going on that comic, but I got a job to do. He's a boss or something. It's rude. I am the Portuguese woman. am the boss. You see? Oh, okay. I'm paying attention. I am. I'm just like all over the board. You didn't hear about my daughter is going to seminary before school and it starts at six o'clock in the morning, which means I have to get up at five thirty in the morning. That is my best sleep time. I've had two naps every day and it is not enough. It's from a little extra aggressive. I don't apologize.
00:07:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
what is seminary like church?
00:07:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, so it's a program for my church that we have for the high schoolers and they go not every place has early morning but most of them I think have early morning and they go for an hour and they follow this it's kind of like Sunday school but it's specifically for the teenagers we have this program called come follow me and it's a program that goes through because I'm LDS so we have the Book of Mormon but we also go through the Bible and they study it for a year but there's a lot of kids and so they get I don't know there's this extra fortification of spirituality before going into the cesspool of high school and she comes out like feeling good enough lifted and with some of the filthy stuff that people have to do within school I'm really glad because I did not have that I was the filthy stuff in school so I feel a little bit better for my kids.
00:08:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I gave in here drop of the F-flops.
00:08:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, people, when I was like in six or seven grade, people would be like, your dad or cast is like a sailor. I'm like, no, I make them less. yes, we're a little bit different. I've been on a path. Let me tell you. Okay. I hate looking at numbers when I'm tired. My brain looks at it and glazes over. Um, so we're only into September. Let me just kind of. So I'm looking at cases closed resolutions. I'm sharing screens because Mark takes whatever and works his blood, giving me what I want. He doesn't like it. He can yell at me, but he's never done that. So we'll see. He should have, but he hasn't. Uh, this is just September. So obviously these little snapshots are almost nothing. I don't even think that it's probably wise to look at. it by a month. Can we do the last 60 days? Oh yeah, that's what, you know, not last 30, last 60. All right. I heard you got a bunch of cases shifted over to Yuri, Patrick. Was it to Hank?
00:09:39 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I thought it was Oh, well, but that's why though, because of Yuri, because of the new law clerk.
00:09:48 - Lorenz Schuerch
So is Hank, is he getting a full caseload now?
00:09:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Why don't think so? He's too new for that, I think. I think, I think, I need to ask Mark about what left-hand knows about the right hand in this company, because... Yeah, I think one of these days I need to get Mark on here with all of us, so I can do same page and be like, what's up? That would be helpful. Yeah, so just helping because Arizona volume is increasing. For September so far, Arizona is leading the pack in terms of volume, so that's a shift. It wasn't like that before, and... So that has to come into account, especially because not everybody can practice in Arizona. Let look at this close to 25 team, and that's probably an outlier case that's not bad, which you have to drill into and look at. Average days to close cases, that number is shrinking. That's good. And Patrick, you're still not really getting the, what I would call a normal load to really look at this. So I'm gonna stop sharing on that right now. What I would like to talk about if I can find the right tab is just some tasks. Okay, so we talked about Oh, hold on a second. I'm gonna go to all this plants and provide feedback and culture and based on it. So the problem with me, I know to me to write my own notes, but then I'm busy talking so it's really hard to get them good. Let's do this and start with this really because I meant to ask you this, but then I got distracted. What? Tell me what you've just been working on, what you've noticed. You're working on in terms of leadership and management over the last week.
00:12:50 - Lorenz Schuerch
Always go first.
00:12:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I Patrick Gole this time. It's so short of you, Lauren. Well, you, Lauren.
00:13:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
We call that punting. Working on leadership.
00:13:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Management, you know, just what are you doing to drive momentum and improvement?
00:13:24 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I'll see what's gone Thursday Friday. So, you know, Cynthia and I kind of just filled in her place picking calls and just kind of keeping everything going. Or as I probably could have just deferred and let Elsie pick up, you know, all the stuff where she got back, but, you know, it's not about just because she's the case manager. She's got to handle that stuff. It's kind of why I was trained the way I was then. You know, if she's not a year, I could still couldn't do all the tasks that Cynthia's supposed to do, that else he's supposed to do. and it's for the benefit of the team for me to keep the ball rolling. So, um, hopefully Cynthia saw that, you know, just because I'm the attorney doesn't mean, I mean, I could have just dumped calls on her. Um, but, you know, we both kind of filled in for, I'll see what she was gone. So. But she notices that the attorney is also willing to do the work that they're doing and nobody's, you know, just getting like their tasks laid on when they come back.
00:14:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good.
00:14:46 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
And is she back?
00:14:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. And did she notice?
00:14:52 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I haven't talked to her about it, but I'm sure I gave her like a list of things that, you know, the calls I made and, you know, when he's doing to be done, so.
00:15:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When did she but she didn't say anything?
00:15:07 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
No.
00:15:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, so that's good as now. What the heck is going on with my stuff? OK. It's about like disappearing tabs and makes me mad. But I am tired, so probably everything makes me mad right now. Anyway. Tell about your prioritization throughout the week. Or do you feel like you did a good job at prioritizing throughout the week?
00:15:58 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
This month, making sure that settle. are going to be coming in at the end of the month or mid-month, and the last week or last month was strictly money-in work, so prioritizing, making sure that records that need to be received are being worked on to come in, being proactive on calling insurance companies, not just waiting for the deadline to arrive. That's what happened to focus on this, mostly.
00:16:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And do you feel like that makes any difference?
00:16:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, 100%.
00:16:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how can you observe that? How would you quantify that?
00:16:56 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Well, like sometimes I'll call insurance like two weeks before the deadline. that line and be like, hey, I've got chance to review. they're like, yeah, I'm actually finishing it up now. So who knows? Maybe they would have just sat on it and did that line and been like, hey, here's our offer. But if I can get that number two weeks early and negotiate it that week and get it done, then I just saved a week on that case. Because the insurance company isn't jumping up and down to send us anything. I noticed because it takes 30 days for them to send a response that didn't require 30 days. now I'm sure Lorenz knows, too, like when you want to grind on money in like the last week, things start to come in and you get it done. So it's one of those things where if you really put the effort into it, it does make a difference. It's just you kind of have to manage what when you're doing that. Like the end of the last month, I wouldn't be smart for me to do that because The goal is to get money in at that point.
00:18:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're saying that there is a time when it's not smart to grant out those calls?
00:18:15 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, like last month at the end of the month, the first settlement goes mad that the money in goes non-med. doesn't really make sense for me to dump all this time for settlements when winning money in for that month. So now that we achieved that, now I can go back to pushing for settlements. And then as the month goes on, you kind of balance what you need.
00:18:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What if you considered splitting it up in the weeks rather than the months, for example? So we have talked about segmenting time for efficiency, for momentum, for flow, right? Because, there's every case is going to be in a different space and they all come in kind of steadily, right? So if let's say there's a couple like the first half of the week you're dealing with settlements, the second half you're dealing with money in and collecting or whatever the language would be or you know what going back and forth but I feel like if you're waiting if there's a two-week gap there's too much potential for cooling off for the cases that wherever they're sitting. let's say they're sitting with the client, let's say they're sitting with the doctor, let's say they're sitting with insurance, whatever. The longer they're there and you're not following up on it, the more their figurative or literal piles stack up on top of your stuff, you're not top of mind anymore. as if you're cycling through everything in a timely manner, then there's less cooling off period and potentially, now this is a theory, this is not 100%, this is how it's going to work and it can't be that because there's too many expectors going into it. But I think that that's probably too big of a gap to be focusing on one particular goal over the other, and we'd love to see what happens if you shift it to really kind of being mindful of both at all times, even if you do choose maybe it could be parts of a day, certain times throughout the week, but what could that look like? And Lorenz, I'm happy to hear any feedback from you about what you might be doing, but that since those are two major goals and within them they have different types of activities. What do you think could be an ideal that increases the frequency of really working each goal? Not necessarily grinding because to me that language is kind of like first of all it's it actually feels more reactive rather than proactive. We need to get here because we haven't got here yet. And yeah, well just the whole reactive versus proactive. So what do you think that we do to kind of improve that schedule?
00:21:33 - Lorenz Schuerch
Well, you know, I understand where Patrick's coming from. That's that's like an issue that I think all of us have because, you know, we'll hit settlement goal. And you know, everyone, Mark and Mary and everyone wants to make sure we hit both goals. And so we're super we hyper focus on on the money in goal. And that that's an issue that, you know, I've always had. Because not just that you hear a sweep, all the prior law firms is just because it's just that nature of the beast, you settle a lot of cases at the beginning of the month. And then for whatever reason, you need to rush and get your money in before the end of the month. And so it's kind of put up into that way. I think I'm starting to find a group with my team where we're able to, instead of only doing money in, we can still focus on managing the cases. those regular meetings with my team, we review the cases and try to move them forward, regardless of what time of the month it is. And so that allows us to send to me biggest determinative factor for settlements is usually the more demands you have out, the more settlements. They're going to get it. And so I try to move those cases ready for demand as quickly as I can. And so thus, the regular reviews with the team are going to help me do that a lot quicker than if I were to just review them by myself and then wait for them to answer my questions. I'll review a case and then I'll ask Jessica, where are we at on the records for this? Mike, help me talk to client about doing injections, things like that and then I have to wait for their response. So if I'm reviewing the bases at night, I have to wait 12 hours until they respond. Whereas if we review together, then we have all those answers together. We're all on the same page at the same time and we can move those cases a lot quicker.
00:23:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like that. What if you've looked at it more as a linear approach rather than two buckets, right? Settlement versus closed and... got the money in because really there is no case closing a money in until you've reached a settlement, right? So there is just a straight line trajectory for each case. And the real goal is complete the case with the maximum amount of money possible, having handled almost even like it's an obstacle course. Like, you've seen American Ninja Warrior. I'm a nerd, but also I'm like, want to be gladiator, that kind of girl. If I could program and be a gladiator, I'd be perfect. Okay. Anyway, so every obstacle is completely different, right? is a different skill set, different muscles. But you can't get to the end, you get to collect nothing, you don't get to ring the buzzer if everything in between isn't done really well. Everything has to be done really well. So what you want to do is make sure that you have a process for making sure that all of that is getting done on a cycle. And if a day isn't a good enough cycle, then maybe it's a day and a half, maybe it's a two day cycle, whatever, but you really want to be working everything top to bottom where it's at in a cycle. And the reason for the cycle is because task switching is not efficient. Let's say if you were just going to keep going, okay, well, where's this case and go down a case list, that doesn't make any sense because you're constantly task-wishing there. All those cases are in different statuses. Whereas if you're operating on a status basis, you're remaining in a particular mindset and a particular operational mode, right? So calling insurance companies. Anybody that's in a status of, I've got call insurance companies. Anybody that's in the status of, we need to get some files. And then, within that, you want to have that segmented on your team as much as possible. So, one person on the team that's doing certain types of calls that they're best at, types of procedures within the statuses, does that make sense? If you, let's just hypothetically do that. If you were going to take the team, no, actually let's do that. This, could you create an outline and a framework and probably not here on the call, but I would really actually love to see this. As a matter of fact, I'm going to make an assignment for both of you and we'll compare notes later, don't do this together, don't talk about it at all. This is going to be really revealing in a good way. So, if you, You have any kind of trust in me at all. Trust me with this and also be patient with me because it's going to be tedious and you hate it, especially you Patrick, you're really going to hate it. I just know you were going to hate it. Don't hate me, just hate the activity. I really want you to write down all the types of things that has to happen in a case from the point that intake gives it to you until the time that you've gotten distributions and money is in. Okay? There can be major sections and then subtasks, but I really want a thorough outline of what the entire process is. Then what I want you to do, I'm going to go highlight this, then what I want you to do is write the name of whoever does any of those types of activities and who, so I'll know if you don't have that person. in there on your team. know that person never touches those things. So then what I'm going to have you do is tell me who does the most of them, who does it the best. And then after you guys have done that, we're going to come back and kind of look at the schedule and go, okay, could we try an experiment? We don't have to do this permanent. But try an experiment that we will come up with. We don't have it defined yet of working through that with kind of almost special teams, right? So people specializing in particular types of tasks and just working through those. Now obviously there's times when like somebody's out of the office and so somebody else is going to have to pitch in things like that. But and it may just cause a serious morale issue. It might just be really hated and we don't want to do that either. But here's If you guys want to do this job the best that you can, if you want to make the most amount of money that you can for the firm, but I'll end for yourself, if you want to have job security, and even if that means, let's say something happens, terrible sweet line it went under, which is not going to happen because they're too smart, but let's say it did, your skill set is going to be so solid that you'll be valued no matter where you go. What you won't get is somebody that's going to come in and support you and train you and give you all of these things that's just going to make you just so optimized. But if you want to do the best that you can, you're going to have to do something other than just show up and we work the case. What we can do, if you'll trust me, if you'll go through these processes, is find a way where everyone around you you is performing at their best and getting, hitting policy limits, getting the highest level and distribution that you can, all of those things are just going to be happening as a norm. We can't control, you know, the, like, hit it on the ball park, little cases, the million dollar cases, the death cases, things like that. We can't control how much that we get. What we can control is how quickly we get through things. We can influence policy limits. We can influence distributions. We can't control that, but we can definitely significantly influence it, right? And then we can also significantly influence, but not fully control, how long it takes to close a case. We know that because there's a significant disparity among the teams that is actually really starting to line up more. So all of those things being optimized the best. Bottom line keeps improving. I've been watching that for three and a half years so I can tell you, it makes a big difference. The other thing I can tell you is that these types of things make, so let's say somebody's got an illness and you can't work for a while. difficult happens at home or you lose a family member or a parent or something, Having systems like this means that when those hard times come, not if but when because they happen to every human being, something difficult happens that throws you out of your game and makes work difficult. It means that you've built up such a good system that you can do it even when you're struggling and still do pretty well and because you will have built up a solid team around you, those times will not be as difficult as well. So that's the benefit of figuring out how to optimize these things as much as possible. So that being said, Will you make that outline that I've requested of you for what needs to be done with the case, start the finish for the view?
00:32:09 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, so in the next three months, I've got to do some shifting around because Vary has gone all month, this month for her surgery. And the next month, Jessica is taking two weeks off for her wedding. And the month after that, John is taking two weeks off for his, the birth of his son. And then that same month, Mike is taking a week off to go to a wedding.
00:32:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's actually perfect timing to do this type of exercise because you really need to take inventory of your team of the work who can do what and so that you have a game plan because within all of those planned absences are going to be unplanned absences as well. just happens. Yeah. So you want to be prepared for that as much as possible, have contingencies back up.
00:33:06 - Lorenz Schuerch
People take on extra work, they get sick more often than they get.
00:33:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And we're going into winter. So it's just going to happen. So what happens though, the other thing I want you guys to, I know I've said it, but I really want you to kind of internalize this is when you look at things. Okay, so either of you guys like watch football, I don't know, played football. know you did, you swam, Swam and did. Huh?
00:33:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
How much football?
00:33:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You guys football. Well, so I mean, you guys have seen game plans, right?
00:33:54 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yes, as a nose.
00:33:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Kind of. I mean, I'm also like, basketball coach and soccer post.
00:34:01 - Lorenz Schuerch
I have a game plan so sports analogies will come up from time to time. I have a soccer guy so if you don't get too deep into football I can follow a bit.

Hey well it's called football in England so I'm pretty much everywhere else but anyway so the thing is is that when you're trying to just get a concept and trying to figure out who's playing what and you're you're talking about it ambiguously or talking about it just verbally it's one kind of thing but when you can see it when you can see what the pieces are when you can visualize it when you can wrap your head around it then your concept is that much clearer and it can happen even with the day-to-day tasks like you might look at that and go holy crap that's a lot of things that we do and you might notice how easy it is for things to fall through the crop you might look at that and go you know what we don't have anybody that's really good at this particular thing or everybody's really good this particular thing or something. What happens with the visual exercise every single time is just a you know what I didn't think about this or you ask yourself a question that you've never asked yourself before or you show it to somebody on the team and I'm like actually it's always a revelatory experience every single time and just you guys know I have to talk everybody into it even if they pay me a lot of money to work with me they still are like I don't want to do it but when we do it nobody has regrets there is always a massive epiphany so this particular exercise probably is not a massive epiphany but there probably is going to be some revelation about what we can do a little bit better but it's the starting point so but what it does release you from doing because we talked about doing some time tracking and both of you are especially part of your blood now thank you Yes.
00:36:01 - Lorenz Schuerch
I did one day, but it took so much out of my day.
00:36:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I got petered out after one day. Yeah, you'll don't love that exercise, but this is kind of a work around. It still kind of helps us take socks. So what you're going to do is we're going to we're going to come up with this outline of the things that get done and then I want you to just kind of start noticing like how how is your current plan for it. We talked about this, Patrick. And to that point, that's when we discovered you've probably checked email, maybe little bit too frequently. How's that been going for you?
00:36:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
It's pretty good. Like the other day I was writing demands.
00:36:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't check it for like two hours. Yeah. how productive was that demand writing?
00:36:51 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
It was good. got stuff done, didn't miss out on anything in the emails.
00:36:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So and have you got any responses to those?
00:37:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
demands? No, this was like the other day.
00:37:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm interested to know if like the quality of the demands were any better.
00:37:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Probably not is probably goes by faster. Just I mean, they're kind of all the same at this point. Like, it's just a matter of getting all the records and stuff in there, but probably speed because what I would usually do is like get through part of it. Okay, let me check my email and then, you know, see something there and next thing, you know, you're on the phone and yeah.
00:37:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm very aware. That's why we have a conversation about checking emails so frequently. So, so you feel like it probably you probably got more done quicker because, okay, so that's the point now. And then what I was talking about is there's a compounding effect to that. So, if you see that day after day, week after week, month after month, guess what starts happening? You'll or cases get results quicker. It's cause and effect. If you're more fluid with your time, if you're not task switching as often, you'll get in the zone a little bit more often, you will complete tasks faster. Along with that, you probably will in complete tasks better. There's just something about the repetition, the fluidity and just the, you know, there's just a lot to be said for repetition and repetition without breaking things up like that. So that's awesome. I'm glad that you're doing that. And do you feel like your, we'll say like just energy and maybe mental clarity was less volatile throughout the day that way?
00:38:58 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. I mean, especially on the demands, like I used to like right half of one and then go back to it and obviously you got to like get yourself back into that case, you know, yes, I just kind of get it done. Yeah, I like it for sure. I think quality and stuff would come out more on like phone calls, things like that, because the demands are kind of repetitive, but yeah, I would do it in more.
00:39:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so I'm really glad that you noticed that I want you to remind yourself of that, because it's very easy to slip into old habits, it can happen, especially, let's say we're having a rough day or having a hard time focusing, could be physical pain, emotional pain, exhaustion, all kinds of things, can get us off task. And you might be shocked, because I'm still shocked at how easily I can forget that I do a particular thing for a particular reason. And it's because it gets me really good results. And then something broke my pattern, and I didn't notice it. I went back to it like, oh yeah, I used to do it this way. And everything was just so much better. So notice that, first of all, not checking email frequently, but especially staying in a task until it's complete. And really noticing the fact that there is such a thing as this mental lag time, which you just described, which is, wait, where was I? And that happens. So in the vein of working cases, one thing that really helps is making really, really clear notes. So have you ever, and maybe you haven't, and maybe this doesn't happen with your team, but I used to work at a call center like 26 years ago. I'm only 26, you guys believe that, right? It's kidding. I'm 40 and I don't care. Anyway, old lady, I'm okay. You can probably be my son.
00:41:01 - Lorenz Schuerch
But you can't remember my baby brother, no not you, you can be a brother.
00:41:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You do kind of remind me of my baby brother, but he's a little bit older now. Anyway, so we, we did tech support for Apple, did tech support for Intel. I was very nerdy. I learned how to build networks from the ground up in Unix and all kinds of different computer languages. So NASA called me for tech support, they're going to call me for tech support. I'm a nerd certifiable. Had to tell you that. Anyway, but we would get cases from other people. And so if they didn't take very good notes, I had to start all over, start from scratch. And if somebody, let's say I was the one taking notes and I needed them to go do a step and I wasn't allowed to stay on the phone with them. They had to go do the step and they had to call Bob. If I didn't have good notes, I wasn't sure where we're starting. even if it was just spending. a minute or two going through the troubleshooting steps, I know I have to go through logically. That was still time. And so the thing about the call centers is that the contractual, there are contractual metrics. have to be handled within a certain amount of time. If that exceed, if that time is exceeded, then they get penalized and the call center doesn't get paid as much. Up to sometimes actually losing money, which is really bad for business. And if they stay within it, then they get bonus money, especially if the calls are resolved within that time period and it's within, you know, call, two calls, whatever. Point is, is that really good notes create mental clarity very quickly. It's not just what's involved, it's how it's sometimes. Bullet pointing particular types of things or highlighting. or keeping them always in the same structure, like here's where the doctors notes are, here's where the pictures that we needed, here's any of this type of stuff, right, just everything being very clear, and complete, so that as the case moves between people or between stages, there's no, okay, what's happening here, because everything is done really clearly. Now, I have not been in your guys' business, I don't know what happens, I haven't seen the cases work through it, I see stuff in little by it, but not a whole lot of it, and I don't know how much of it stays in there or how much of it stays, know, how much of it is happening in Slack or email or physical papers or anything like that. Do you think of, can you think of, throughout your process, anywhere, there might be a place where, I um the notes that get left about the case could make a difference in how long it takes with the next person to do the next job. Does that make any sense?
00:44:10 - Lorenz Schuerch
It was a it was a problem initially with John. lot of people had issues uh taking cases from him because his his notes were basically all or nothing. You either had way too much and you'd you'd be scrolling for days on each job as they got the likes to talk a lot yeah okay or or you'd get nothing or everything wasn't the wrong spot and you had to do like you know summon your inner Colombo to Patrick doesn't even know who Colombo is do you? Probably not.
00:44:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it different Columbus?
00:44:52 - Lorenz Schuerch
No no no no he doesn't know no way okay you're not missing it but anyway you had to be and so it for about a year there is pretty rough and we finally down to a point where everyone is on the same on the same page so that that helps a lot in the speeding up to yeah what you were saying like the efficiency at which a case is moved through the pipeline so do you think that is there any room for improvement in in notes on your team at all but we're kind of at a point where everyone understands each other I don't want to mess with it too much you didn't ask my question so if the if you think everything is going really well and cannot be improved then that's the answer if you think it can be and you're scared to do the improvement we have a whole another conversation to add Lorenz want to say that it's perfect.
00:46:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, there's no such thing. That's not what I'm not smart enough, like right now, I'm not smart enough to know where where it can be improved. Okay, so let me let me come on a different angle. Do you feel like you ever look at anything and go? You just really have to take a little while to figure out what's happening in the case.
00:46:22 - Lorenz Schuerch
There's a couple of things. Yeah, there's a couple of things that I think about it that I wish were a little bit clearer right as I put the case in front of me.
00:46:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So does everybody on the team care about the quality of the work they do? Does everybody on the team want to get the best results out of the time that they work?
00:46:56 - Lorenz Schuerch
Does everybody want to make as much money as they can?
00:47:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
can without having to work over time or extra hours.
00:47:06 - Lorenz Schuerch
I assume so, yeah.
00:47:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, not everybody's motivated that way, and we don't want to make those assumptions because we need to know what their motivators are.
00:47:16 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, I think right now, yes.
00:47:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So to your hesitation of not wanting to mess things up or whatever. We don't want to try to attack anything and we don't want to go after and fix all things all at once. There's nothing perfection is unattainable. Progress and constant progress should be the goal. Constant progress is not more difficult than maintenance because maintenance is not real. You're either improving or you're regressing. So, you want to be actively improving, otherwise you will be regressing. You want to be actively improving because otherwise you are going to be overtaken by apathy at some point. Progress and the pursuit of it is inoculation against apathy. Apathy will get you fired, apathy will cost you money, apathy is pervasive and will creep into the rest of your life. So it should be 18 and a company-wide cultural traits that we improve, not to the point that it's stressful and overwhelming, and I mean because all goals are arbitrary, we set them because we set them. So, if you can say, hey, this week, I noticed this, that's little bit better than we did before. Awesome. Even if nothing else improves, that's awesome. That's progress. Now, to the point of if you see something and you look at it and go, you know, this is taking me a little while to figure out if they had just said this, if this had just been done, then take it as a coaching moment, but, and if you don't want to disrupt people, if you don't want to, you know, hurt morale, which of course we don't want to, then you can also say and look for what was great about it. This was great. The reason we want to work on this is because it caused friction. I couldn't figure out this. I didn't know this. This was not recorded. This was not clear. Okay. So you just want to be really specific about the thing. thing is not the way they handled the whole case. It is this tiny little thing, right? But you want to explain the compounding effect. Compounding works negatively and positively. If we continue to have these friction points, then what that's doing is keeping our, you know, long it takes to resolve a case longer than it ought to be, how long it takes to get paid longer than it ought to be. How long it takes to do the task each day preventing me from being able to get to the distributions or the demands or whatever else I needed to get to today to make sure all the other goals get hit. If a friction point can be identified, then it needs to be addressed. Does that make sense? Now, we clear on what a friction point is?
00:50:49 - Lorenz Schuerch
Anything else close us down?
00:50:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Clear to you, Patrick? just a reminder, what is the one assignment
00:51:00 - Lorenz Schuerch
I have for you guys this week right down all the tasks associated with the case from start to finish and Assign those tasks to do it who completes them.
00:51:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I don't want you to assign anything I want you to tell me who does them right? That's what I meant. Yes. Yes, it's a little bit different because I just want to make Sure you're not going out and talking to the team and say go do this or whatever I just want to know what the current operations is the current function and who does it and who can't do it and who can't Right match it with who does it right? I would also like you to rank who does it best to least Because that would be really helpful as well Especially giving all the the absences you're going to be having Lorenz That would be really good Okay Okay, quiet little Patrick over there. Okay, probably Geez. Ah, cute kid. Anyway, I know you're a grown man, but when you get to a certain age, everybody's a kid below you, right, Laurence?
00:52:08 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah.
00:52:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is. I'm like, but I'm a kid to all the older people and I'm 48. And when they treat me like a baby, I'm like, Oh, Like, it's funny. No, no. Anyway, okay. So let me go back to your notes. I cannot even try that right now, because my tabs are all over the place, not that I have a billion tabs open all the time. Oh, yeah, Patrick, you were having a conversation. We were talking about how Samantha prepares. I'm on the head and prioritizes. And I just want know, have you had any more thoughts about that conversation? I asked you, I think, to ask her about her priorities. If she, if she has, you know, how she chooses her priorities in terms of like distribution, sometimes case lists, that that's what yours were, I think. Uh, says then go back through email and look for docs that will help push cases forward. Oh, you do that. Yeah. Anyway, just has there been any evolution in that conversation in your own minds?
00:53:42 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Um, kind of the same stuff. Just, you just have to be very proactive because like sometimes you'll see something that's already there that could help move the case, you just didn't really think about it. so you have to like constantly be doing file reviews. Because just because something comes in, it may not be the time for it to help move the case forward, but if you're doing file review, then you're always know, like, okay, for this case, I need this. Like a health insurance link can come in at the beginning of the case, but you know, you still got the rest of the case, but if the case is done, you're just waiting for it. Now it's like the one thing that pushes it forward. So doing a lot of file review, making sure you're up to date on where the cases are at, is very helpful to be able to recognize what's going to what you need to get you to the next step.
00:54:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how do you approach file reviews then? You said doing a lot of them?
00:54:44 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I try to do daily, just sections of my case load to go through and basically check out what's going on, check out the notes, look at the treatment, you know, what are we missing. And at that point, I'll task, you know, the team, if I need them to do something, but there's a section of my day that I do that.
00:55:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel like you review all the files by the end of the week?
00:55:15 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Not all, but pretty much most of them, because I mean, I can get through most of them in a week.
00:55:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, and I don't know what the timeline could be or should be, or how, so let me ask you this, actually, and this probably depends on where the case is and what the status is. But do you think, could either one of you give me a ballpark of how long it takes you to review the files? I know that there's got to be a huge range, but I love it for me.
00:55:51 - Lorenz Schuerch
I know exactly what my number is, because I have been timing it for the last two months, so we went from about ago. going to have minutes for file and now we're down to about between two and three minutes for file.
00:56:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you think that you're still that is still a quality review? And is that all in your team file reviews now?
00:56:19 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah.
00:56:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, Patrick, do you do file reviews on your own?
00:56:24 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:56:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Would you consider, do you see any value and potentially, so this is a new process that Lorentz has is is having the team do file reviews together. And then he actually separated that by groups, but you know, your team all works, I think, together. But would you be interested in trying it for a month doing file reviews together and see if that improves anything for you? Maybe speed or understanding clarity of it. lot quicker.
00:57:00 - Lorenz Schuerch
yeah I mean I'll probably do like because I feel like they're I feel like they will get straight with other tasks much more quickly than me because it's not necessarily their responsibility to make sure the case is getting closed like it is for the attorneys like but I think we can do like game ones do you do like every single case learns or is it like big cases or not do every single case I used to do no we used to not do it headcases but now we even do headcases so because we got so efficient and we can review we do twice a week so on Mondays we do distributions cases that we think we're gonna just try we're trying to distribute this month on Tuesdays we do An hour or a foul review, and then on Thursday, we do another hour of foul review, so two hours a week, a foul review. If you count the distribution, that's two and a half, I guess. And then in those two and a half, every three weeks, we go through every single case. So I used to take me probably an hour to an hour and a half a day, every single day, to review them by myself on my own. And then I'd have to assign tasks and follow up on those tasks. Now we can do more work and less time by doing as a team. And so I feel like it's improved my quality of life. I don't. I'm not working like I used to be working like 13 hour days before. just to get those files reviewed, those files reviewed, and my wife asked me to sign a different solution.
00:59:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's all the innovation. So two things, let's stick with you for minute, Patrick. Would you, will you try that?
00:59:21 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I think it could be like a team meeting, but very specific to cases.
00:59:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so what I would like you to do is let me know if structure is going to be and try that. And I don't want you to be like, hey, what do you guys think about it? Hey, this is what we're doing here. You drive it. But what I want you to consider is that you are actually going to be improving your team significantly through this process. Everybody will have a better understanding when you discuss it together, which means that if somebody is not around, you've now got people. people who, because they understand it, they're more viable, they'll be able to do more things eventually over time. So that's important to you, because like, you just heard of Lorenz is like, Oh, it's team is gone, gone, gone, gone, gone. You know, and as you, whether you stay the same size or you grow in your team size, there are going to be things that create hiccups. The better your team is at all things, the less stress it is for everyone, because you've got stronger shoulders across the board to help carry the weight no matter what happens. So you'll really be serving them well by improving them and having that experience Lorenz. I would love to see what happens if you change your file review time to 75 to 90 minutes instead. Again, just, it's a short term, because if it's taking you three weeks to get through everyone. everything and given the length of time that it takes for case resolutions, though it is improving and maybe it's already on that trajectory, maybe just 75 minutes instead of 60, maybe 90s too much. But will you try increasing that time just a little bit or adding one more file review, meaning, but I think you're probably better off increasing the time a little bit and see what happens.
01:01:31 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, I think I can try. So 75 minutes, that's only 15 more minutes, right?
01:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just 15 more minutes, but it's an extra 30 minutes a week. And if you're able to do that, then you probably get down to all your cases in about two and a half weeks, potentially two weeks depending on how well it goes, because you're in flow already. I'm central. Breaking it up between two calls, there's this whole half an hour that's added, or, you know, 15 on one and 15 on the other. That might actually increase that pace a little bit, but what would happen, you know, if you're able to get through that whole caseload and every two, two weeks and a couple days versus three weeks. Because, and I would also love you to go through and check the correlation between your file review and how your pace changed for average rate to close across that time period, we could do it on your one on one call through letify if you want and make that correlation, but I have a feeling that there's some kind of correlation. It's really hard to find out. Because of how long the cases take to close, but, but if there's any kind of relationship, that probably has something to do with it. Yeah. All right, two assignments. Patrick, Lorenz told me what it was last time, what's the assignment?
01:03:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Break down every step of our job, basically. For cases assigned for Mark, who does what? Who does it more efficiently versus the least? And then do a team file review?
01:03:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yep. Okay. You got it. Do you guys have any questions, comments, concerns, complaints?
01:03:38 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Nope.
01:03:40 - Lorenz Schuerch
Nope.
01:03:42 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
All right. don't live in Southern Oregon.
01:03:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, there's, there's a lot of fires here. We've had smoke for. Yeah. All right. right. and I'm not a happy girl about it. I freeze all winter and then they smoke me out all summer and I'm just an angry girl. Okay, okay.
01:04:08 - Lorenz Schuerch
Your tears on it.
01:04:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to. I'm actually going there in a couple weeks. Either that or Vegas. We haven't decided what we're going yet. It's much to be hard to say. But anyway, Vegas, they're not Vegas. Arizona that I could retire there. But I'm portable so I'll just go everywhere and see all the people. Stay away from rednecks.
01:04:32 - Lorenz Schuerch
Okay. Well, maybe don't come to Arizona then.
01:04:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh no, there is no comparison. I promise you.
01:04:39 - Lorenz Schuerch
They do call us a Florida of the West.
01:04:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I guess it depends on where you're at.
01:04:45 - Lorenz Schuerch
But I'm telling you, you can't compete with these people.
01:04:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's a town called Clement Falls. We like ranked in the top five in the nation for domestic violence. Matthew, use um yeah and all the things that correlate so low income um high unemployment and just ignorance and stupidity and it's willful and it's disgusting or whatever i mean it's not everybody because huh pictures look nice oh yeah i mean the nature's pretty except for when it's on fire i'm not angry everything's fine i'm not angry at all all right you guys you're awesome keep up the good work and wait who am i talking to next week okay patrick patrick i'm gonna pick on you next week and then oh oh so that was the last question i want to ask do you guys find the value still in um being able to collaborate every other week or would you like it just to be one on one twice a month elaborate I like the library as well, because I think it's really useful because you both have very different insights you just different people and I think that that's great, but I wanted to check and make sure because this is really this is your time so. Thanks for showing up and letting me work with you. You guys are great.
01:06:20 - Lorenz Schuerch
Bye.

> I hope that you can find some value in these things and grow in power, purpose and peace yourself. 💙
-end post-
I’m Tina Marie, and I’m a business consultant
that has helped several startups grow to million
dollar businesses within a year, and others to
multi-million dollar companies in under three years
from their inception.
To tell you how I got here, I’d have to go back a
good 30+ years. I was entrepreneurial and geeky
from the beginning. At 8, I was learning how to
write programs in BASIC on a Radioshack TRS80
(think floppy disk and cassette tape drives... oh
yeah!) Lemonade stands were a little too social for
my taste, back in the day, so at ten, I was mowing
lawns and babysitting. By 11 I had a paper route
and made a good $65 a month. From that point
on, if I wanted something, I was the one who made
it happen.
I worked in fields picking crops with migrant
workers. I worked in school cafeterias and then
hustled my way into a job at a Law office as a 16
year old runner for 5 local attorneys when I had
decided I wanted to go into law.
I managed to get a full ride to college and then
quit.. Three times before quitting for good, when
I realized I couldn’t stand the agendas and
propoganda that came with the education.
Instead, I found a way to get paid to learn, and
started working in a call center that housed tech
giants like Intel, Apple, Adobe and the likes. While
I started as a technician, I rapidly moved up the
ranks to account management during my 6 years
there. I learned that I have a knack for improving
any environment I worked in via optimization.
My systems saved jobs and accounts before I even
realized the power of what I had created.
After the birth of my second (of four) daughters,
I decided to figure out how to replace my full
time income from home. While I went down the
“SQUIRREL!!!” path that most entrepreneurs find
themselves on, I quickly (Within a year) realized I
could take my existing skills and find a home for
them online.
I’ve been growing companies as a secret weapon
on the inside ever since... all while having the time
to raise my girls, cook their meals, coach them in
sports and do the things that matter most to me.
And now... 16 years after starting online and 17
years after my first child, I’m sharing my systems

Math Is
Your Friend.
Chapter 1
Most entrepreneurs do not go into
business because they love crunching
numbers and balancing the books.
It is impossible to tell someone you are not
speaking to personally exactly how they should
price and package their offers.
This is my solution to that problem.
I am going to give you ten customizable scenarios
with different types of products and packages that
you can plug into your business (with a little brain
power from yourself) that should help you see
what you can change to get more profits out of
your business, with very little additional work other
than creating the offers and writing them up.
Most entrepreneurs get started because they are
unsatisfied with the status quo in some way or
another and find the only solution is to create their
own paths.
We venture out on it and learn as we go. And while
there are tons of great programs that teach how to
SELL or even WHAT to sell...
There is very little spoken about how to package an
offer and what prices to use to hit your goals.
There is a reason for that...
Start With
“Why”?
Chapter 2
Why is it so hard to charge the right
price?
If they cannot do it at all... obviously you have
value.
If you can do it FASTER or BETTER than they
can... you have verifiable value.
When YOU are your product, how you value yourself
has EVERYTHING to do with this struggle.
Here are some things you need to consider in
your mind when you figure out your value to your
clients:
Could they do what you (or your product or
service) will do for them, or as well or as fast as
you could?
Mindset.
Chapter 3
You Actually Are
Expert Enough.
Chapter 3: Part 1
Most unpaid experts don’t yet consider
themselves expert enough to charge
money.
Easy deal, right? That food is going to cost him
money and time, and you’re okay with that, right?
Why? Because you gave him value and you both
know it.
Well... when you’re giving value to a complete
stranger who you are only interacting with
through websites, text, videos and other marketing
materials... even socially on the interwebs...
Trading BBQ for your genius skills isn’t really going
to pan out. And the bottom line is: If you don’t
charge properly you will end up broke.
If you know more than the average person does,
and you can help them do something they could
not do as fast or as well as you can help them to
do, then you are expert enough to charge money.
Money is simply the currency used to exchange
value
Look, let’s say your neighbor wants you to come
help him on the computer because he’s a
technoob and well, you’re awesome. But, because
he’s your friend and lives next door... he doesn’t
offer money, he offers to send you over some of his
killer BBQ when he grills this weekend.
Being Broke
Helps No One.
Chapter 3: Part 2
You are not going to be around to help
anyone because you’re broke and
depressed.
But the economy needs you to contribute!
You have a serious obligation to go out there and
compete for business and serve YOUR MARKET.
You know... the ones who don’t want to do business
with that douchebag Steve who may be as good
or even a little bit better at what you do, but isn’t
worth the investment.
Sound a little brutal? I know. But... YOU KNOW I’M
RIGHT.
So stop arguing with me and with yourself and
listen up.
Getting paid properly is the way to feel free and
happy AND it’s the way to ensure you have the
resources you need to continue to hone your
craft and offer your products and services to the
marketplace.
I don’t want this to go to your head or anything...
Why You and
Not Some Other
Expert?
Chapter 3: Part 3
There are a ton
of reasons why
people will want
to pay you and
not someone else.
I don’t want to spend a long time on this so just
think about how you’ve chosen one person over
another simply on feeling instead of value. If you
show up and do the work, you can find a way to
get a piece of the market.
That’s my pep talk.
If you need one on one advice, you can always some time with me for a little tough love.
(Paid of course... I KNOW MY VALUE)
Pricing and
Packaging.
Chapter 4
Remember, I don’t
know exactly
what you’re doing
and what you’re
offering or how
good you are.
If you feel like you’re not good enough to charge some of these prices... lower them.
Then... improve your skills. That being said... Here’s a good rule of thumb to follow.
If you’re offering one on one consulting time or group coaching (and you’re not a
TOTAL narcissist)...
10% Rule
of Thumb.
Chapter 4: Part 1
Take the highest price you’re
comfortable with charging and then
ADD 10% to that price.
Let’s talk about the different types of products
and services you might offer. This is going to
relate to digital products and virtual services. Any
physical products could be added in as well...
just remember to calculate your profit margins
accordingly.
Once you start getting sales at your price,
incrementally increase your price by 5-10% for
every new customer you take on until you stop
getting conversions.
DON’T BE THE ONE TO TELL YOURSELF NO!
Let your customers tell you what they will pay.
*note – correct pricing and packaging for value isn’t going to be
enough if you don’t know how to pitch your offer. If pitching is hard
for you, study the book called “Pitch Anything” and work on that
skill. It will serve you well in many areas of life to improve this one
skill.
Lead With
Value.
Chapter 4: Part 2
First of all, I’m a big believer in leading
with value.
I grow businesses in many different ways. One of
them is helping entrepreneurs craft solid offers and
clear their head trash so they can actually pitch
them and make money.
I found that is SUCH a common problem that I
decided I would give as much help with that as
possible, free of charge. Obviously, it would work
better one on one... but this is a way I can serve my
market and find potential leads.
Do the same thing for your market.
You’re reading my “lead by example” version of that
right now.
I want you to get some value from me and KNOW
I’m worth investing in before I ever ask you to
invest. If I can’t do that, I’ll probably not convince
you I’m worth your time anyway and that’s just not
a foundation I can build on.
So find a way to create something of value for your
market that you can give away. Create something
that complements OR supplements what you
already do.
Map a Value
Ladder.
Chapter 4: Part 3
The next thing
you will create to
ascend them up
your value ladder
is a low level
offer, sometimes
referred to as a
trip wire.
You can have many different entry points into your marketing “eco system”... it does not have to be simply
linear... but for the sake of simplicity and what I like to focus on, “Fastest Path to Cash” let’s consider a linear
value ladder starting with free, to low cost and upwards.
Your low cost product should be something that can solve ONE specific problem for them. It should be easily
digestible within one to two hours and should allow them the ability to implement within a day.
The price here is between $6-$20. There’s so many ways you can validate that your product (ebook or video
training work really well) is worth more than dinner for two.
It may take you a while to think about why... but think it out.... Write up those bullet points and look at it. When
you look at that and say “That’s a no brainer”... You’ve got a winner.
Don’t
Overthink It.
Chapter 4: Part 4
Remember to
make it easily and
quickly digestible
and actionable!
The problem you will want to solve is not so much
how to give value, not if you know your stuff.
It’s going to be more about demonstrating the
value in a product they haven’t seen yet well
enough to get them to part with their money. So
focus on this part!
Pretend it’s your best friend and you want them to
understand why they HAVE to have this. You would
tell them:
• Benefit!
• Benefit!
• Benefit!
• Benefit!
• Benefit!
What are the benefits of your product? Get CLEAR
on that and making the pitch will be a lot easier, as
will choosing the price.
Your
Core Offer.
Chapter 4: Part 5
The next offer is going to be your core
offer.
This is the one that should bring you the majority
of your income. All of your marketing and products
will be leading up to THIS product or service that
allows you to give max benefit to max audience
size.
My preference is that this is scaleable, so it’s a
digital product or training that modulated and
self-paced (online membership course etc) with
possible weekly trainings, live videos, q and a etc
inside of a group.
This lets you leverage your time while being
able to serve more people at a solid price point.
Upsells.
Chapter 4: Part 6
Upsells are not created to be just one
more possible way to squeeze money
out of a prospect.
Once you’ve shown them value at each level, they
are much more likely to want more from you and
be willing to pay higher prices if you continue to
offer them what they want.
Upsells are going to solve a problem that not
everyone in your market need solved, but the ones
who do need it solved understand the value of it.
I’ll use one of my own value ladders as an example:
It has to be purposeful and make sense for your
market.
Keep this in mind... people that pay the least
expect the most.
It’s harder to sell people on free and $5 than it is to
sell the RIGHT person on $200 or more.
The person who’s focused on VALUE rather than
dollars (no, they are not the same) is going to
be willing to spend more.
TripWire Offer – Projects in a Box
Pre-mapped out project templates for multiple business scenarios to help the “organizationally challenged”
get organized fast. $17 per template
Core Offer – My Freedom Systems - $97
Four modules in a membership site teaching people Email management (email overwhelm KILLS
productivity) Time management, Project Management (next level on what to do with the templates you

RARE UPSELL – I offer this to less than 1% of my audience
Retainer client agreement. Price varies. They get weekly calls with me and I speak to them and their team
to keep projects on schedule and optimize profits and time. I’ll spend 1-5 hours a week with clients from
$2500-$10,000 a month. It’s not for everyone. The ones who want it are the ones who make enough that my
optimization skills validate the investment.
Applying this to your offer.
Think hard and DON’T undervalue yourself.
Okay... Here’s the worksheet to help you with some
numbers and seeing HOW fast things can add up
to $10k a month for you.
Did I just hear you say “Finally!!!!”???
I better not have!
I had to warm you up to know what to plug in there,
Speedy Gonzales.
Without context, the numbers don’t mean anything.
If you got to this point and skipped the rest above...
Slap yourself on the wrist! Then go back up and
read it.
The strategy is to segment what you offer into a
value ladder that you can ascend your customers
up through.
Use benefit bullet points to help you figure out what
a price is for these offers.
Think about how much time and stress your
product or service will save them.
Use reference points like minimum wage hours
worked vs. expert hours. If you gave them,
effectively, an hour worth of your time, is that not
worth twice minimum wage?
Is it worth dinner for two? Is it worth ... Well... What is
it worth?
Example
Scenarios.
Chapter 5
Scenario One:
Lowballed.
Chapter 5: Part 1
Lowballed.
When you’re too afraid to charge much... do you see how many sales you have to make in order to hit $10,000
a month? Ask yourself... is it harder to charge more and get fewer people to say yes or to charge less and get
more people to say yes?
Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue
TripWire $5 750 $3,750
Core Offer $20 150 $3,000
Upsell 1 $67 50 $3,350
Total Revenue $10,100
Scenario Two:
Bump the Core
Offer.
Chapter 5: Part 2
Bump the Core Offer.
Here, doubled the TripWire cost, but it’s still only $10. We bumped the Core Offer price $7 and left the upsell
the same. Here’s the thing. With this offer, you need 315 LESS “yes’s” to get to $10k a month.
When you think about what’s harder... getting a yes or a yes at a few buck higher... usually it’s just the “yes”
that’s scariest. I told you... MATH IS YOUR FRIEND!
Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue
TripWire $10 500 $5,000
Core Offer $27 100 $2,700
Upsell 1 $67 35 $2,345
Total Revenue $10,045
Scenario Three:
Bump in Price +
Conversion.
Chapter 5: Part 3
Bump in Price + Conversion.
Again... just a few tweaks to the price and now we need even less sales to hit that number.
Something to think about is the percentage of conversions that take the offer. The higher you can increase
your conversion rate from TripWire to Core Offer to Upsell, the more sales you get, the higher value each of
your new customer becomes.
As that happens, you can afford to invest more to acquire each new lead.
Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue
TripWire $12 475 $5,700
Core Offer $37 75 $2,775
Upsell 1 $67 25 $1,675
Total Revenue $10,150
Scenario Four:
Vip Pricing.
Chapter 5: Part 4
Vip Pricing.
This is a powerful example of what happens when you have higher ticket offers available. With only TWO
sales, you just added nearly $2k to your monthly revenue total. See how fast that can add up?
Only two sales out of your 450 customers. Improve your conversion rate and that generates a lot more
money very quickly. EXCITING, ISN’T IT? Bet you wanna call up your old math teacher and thank them!
Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue
TripWire $12 450 $5,400
Core Offer $37 45 $1,665
Upsell 1 $97 10 $970
Upsell 2 $997 2 $1,994
Total Revenue $10,029
Scenario Five:
Double the Upsell
Price.
Chapter 5: Part 5
Double the Upsell Price.
Here we upped the Core offer $20 and doubled the upsell price.
Remember, these are mock scenarios just to give you an visual idea of what happens when just a few
numbers change.
Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue
TripWire $12 300 $3,600
Core Offer $37 40 $2,680
Upsell 1 $197 15 $2,955
Upsell 2 $997 1 $997
Total Revenue $10,232
Scenario Six:
Tripped Up.
Chapter 5: Part 6
Tripped Up.
Upped that TripWire and BOOM. More $$.
Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue
TripWire $20 275 $5,500
Core Offer $67 40 $2,680
Upsell 1 $197 5 $985
Upsell 2 $997 1 $997
Total Revenue $10,162
Scenario Seven:
Lower Upsell
Price.
Chapter 5: Part 7
Lower Upsell Price.
Some different price points. Lower Upsell prices need a few more front end sales, but not much.
Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue
TripWire $20 300 $6,000
Core Offer $67 40 $2,680
Upsell 1 $147 8 $1,176
Upsell 2 $497 1 $497
Total Revenue $10,353
Scenario Eight:
Lower Core Offer
Price.
Chapter 5: Part 8
Lower Core Offer Price.
Lowered the Core Offer price... still making $10k.
Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue
TripWire $20 300 $6,000
Core Offer $47 45 $2,115
Upsell 1 $147 10 $1,470
Upsell 2 $497 1 $497
Total Revenue $10,082
Scenario Nine:
More Please.
Chapter 5: Part 9
More Please.
Want to earn more than $10k a month? Getting those $20 sales on automation isn’t that hard with a good
content or ad strategy.
Even with a ten percent conversion rate on upsells, the profits look pretty nice.
Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue
TripWire $20 500 $10,000
Core Offer $47 50 $2,350
Upsell 1 $147 10 $1,470
Upsell 2 $497 1 $497
Total Revenue $14,317
Scenario Ten:
High Roller.
Chapter 5: Part 10
High Roller.
A few years back, Digital Marketer did a study that found that they could charge THREE Times the price if they
divided that price into three payments and it converted almost as well, only a 2% difference.
Instead of charging $97, they charged three payments of $97 and only lost two percent of sales. Payment
Plans are DEFINITELY something you want to consider adding to your model.
Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue
TripWire $20 500 $10,000
Core Offer $47 50 $2,350
Upsell 1 - 3 PAY $297 10 $2,970
Upsell 2 $997 1 $997
Total Revenue $16,317
Something else you want to consider is making sure that your tripwire cost balances out your ad budget.
Work on your conversion rate and prices so that you break even on any ad costs with trip wire sales.
In other words... If it costs you $2 for a new lead and your tripwire is $20, you need to convert every tenth lead
into a customer to break even.
Or... lower your lead cost.
Or... raise your tripwire cost... but that could hurt you if you go above $20 depending on your market.
If you’ve served them well with your free offer, you may be able to get more.

Line.

Are you guys here together? Can you hear me? Hello?
00:00:56 - mark sweet
You Hey.
00:01:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi, I can hear you guys. I'll hear you. Do I have both of you?
00:01:06 - mark sweet
No, I'm going to do a round then. Hold on, absolutely my mouth.
00:01:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going see you too. I'm going brush my teeth and I feel like I missed something and it's driving me nuts. I'm tired. Hey.
00:01:42 - mark sweet
Is this a home office or office office? No, it's not. The office is the one usually see it with the window where you can see the airplanes.
00:01:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, we're hardly ever on video, so I don't know. Now we've got Chona. Oh, no audio yet. Water. Oh, there. Something. Hi. I am so excited to meet you in person. Well, Zoom person, you know, this person. You're so pretty. I mean, I mean, you're gorgeous.
00:02:26 - Chona Sweet
Oh, thank you. It's probably a good idea.
00:02:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've got like three tablets, three laptops, one desktop, you know.
00:02:43 - Chona Sweet
Oh, I was drinking a crap.
00:02:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I thought that the this would be the fastest way to kind of figure out what, because you've talked about what Chona's doing a little bit Mark and like how there's some income potential there and then Chona you're just getting your head wrapped around showing up being the schedule and then also Mark has a different kind of brain those those business brain people it can be a lot so it's a good thing it's just not you know like trying to get on the same page with everybody we all think differently and very intensely so mark if you would pretend I don't know anything about anything and give me just the real like third-grade version of what you see the potential is then we can start the conversation from there yeah so there's
00:04:00 - mark sweet
three income streams.
00:04:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:04:04 - mark sweet
The first one is what I would consider traditional medical practice.
00:04:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:04:10 - mark sweet
So the doctor, his name is Dr. E, just so we're all kind of on the same page. Okay. Dr. E's primary practice is traditional healthcare pain management.
00:04:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you.
00:04:24 - mark sweet
So he is the pain management provider of multiple facilities and clinics. what I mean by facilities is hospitals, including health insurance. So he primarily bills health insurance, gets reimbursed from health insurance, and that's where he's paying employees from.
00:04:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:04:48 - mark sweet
That'll make sense.
00:04:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sort of. is my problem with trying to take notes and listen at the same time.
00:04:54 - mark sweet
So I'm just going to listen and let the AI note taker do its job. So most people who are professional, being doctors or nurse practitioners, those are the people seeing the patients, get paid on a per visit payment.
00:05:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:05:09 - mark sweet
So you get paid X amount per person that you visit, more people you see, more money you make.
00:05:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:05:18 - mark sweet
So that is in the hospital, some of it's in clinic settings, some of that is telehealth follow-ups.
00:05:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:05:25 - mark sweet
Yep. Now I'm ready to get paid the same across the board, no matter what that is. Okay. So when you generally want to go to places, we're going to see more patients, because if you're driving around and only seeing two patients at each place, you're kind of losing time on money. So let's say one facility, a 17 new people to see and one has two. Right. advertise a 17. So that's the main traditional practice. Okay. Second part is the personal injury practice. Okay. So that's most similar to what Fuji does, from kind of what you know, the difference is Dr. E. he doesn't just do consultations. He does procedures and surgery.
00:06:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:06:07 - mark sweet
So he works with a wide variety of lawyers and other doctors. So we're used to seeing maybe 10 or 15 lawyers that food you might work with, Dr. D for hours 50 of them. Some good, some bad, some in the middle. Okay. And so part of running Chona on is the medical records for a traditional practice versus PI practice. Well, they necessarily shouldn't be this way are different. Okay. Here's what I mean by that. Good enough is good enough a lot of the time for traditional practice. So we're noticing and seeing a lot of dictation service from Dr. D, where it's just dragon dictation and writing the notes. Okay. But there's a lot of typos and misspellings and some other things because it's not perfect. Which the general gist is there. Okay. In personal injury, that causes problems when you get into litigation or further on, because it looks like you're doing what you need to do. And so bringing on Chona is a couple of things. One, being able to see more personal injury patients. Two, having someone who actually can write records and reports that make sense, which is part of what I've been working with her on. There's lot of things that would get complicated and we can jump into those later. Very, very simple right now.
00:07:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, thank you.
00:07:31 - mark sweet
Now Chona can do some basic procedures as an NP, like trigger points and couple of good things.
00:07:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But... Hi, sorry, my daughter's leaving for the night.
00:07:46 - mark sweet
But she can't do things like surgery. She can assist, but she can't do the surgery itself, because she's not the doctor. So the payment structure is a little bit different in that now, legally speaking, she can only get paid for the person she sees. cannot get paid a percentage.
00:08:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, legally formal, yes.
00:08:05 - mark sweet
So we worked out a version of that that makes a lot of sense for her. And I'm assuming hypothetically speaking, hypothetically speaking, there might be a 50 50 split on consultations. So similar to like what Fuji does now where it's 400 500 visit. So split between Chona and Dr.
00:08:27 - Chona Sweet
E.
00:08:28 - mark sweet
And then 20% of whatever the procedure values are. Now procedure values tend to be much more significant, usually running anywhere between 4,000 up to 50,000 plus per procedure.
00:08:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And why would he be interested in sharing that? Because Chona would be the one who is in these patients and people that I know. And how are you getting around the legalities of that? are you creating some other kind of that kind of person, company, whatever.
00:09:03 - mark sweet
So it's a little C and thing. follow our taxes separately, like everything to keep separate.
00:09:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:09:11 - mark sweet
So I get no personal benefit out of doing this. I just get a happy wife.
00:09:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I get some personal benefit. That's not what I mean.
00:09:18 - mark sweet
Like, I think referrals, maybe, for example, Christian, honey, I think that's what people that I know. Because again, I know that Sean is going to do a good job. And, you know, a lot of issues are the same things like these pain doctors get really busy and don't do as good of a job.
00:09:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get that. That's helpful because it's a little more onto it. But when you said technically, she can only get paid per procedure and can't really get a referral fee. How are you structuring that?
00:09:50 - mark sweet
You know, there's a lot of marketing costs involved in what she does. And so more than sure, Dr. would be very happy to pay a marketing fee to help her continue to grow. I wrote for a pipeline.
00:10:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got it. Got it. Um, valid and creative. Well done. So, okay.
00:10:12 - mark sweet
Um, then there's number three because that's number two.
00:10:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you.
00:10:17 - mark sweet
It's okay. Um, and number two, number two or semison. Chona does not need doctor supervision in multiple other states. California is one of the few that she has to be under doctor supervision. So, you know, when you go to the doctor, usually see a PA or an NP, like most of the time. Um, in Washington state, she does not need to be supervised by a doctor. There are. What about Oregon? Sorry.
00:10:46 - Chona Sweet
about Oregon?
00:10:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think you need to an organ either.
00:10:50 - mark sweet
Anyway, sorry.
00:10:51 - Chona Sweet
Carry on.
00:10:52 - mark sweet
Um, but in Washington state, there's two doctors who have tried to use some of the telemed pain docs that we've worked with before. I'm just going to use footage of the exam. and they weren't thrilled with like some of the reports and just again when the pain dogs get really busy things then you get to sloppy. Yeah. And so because I'm I'm just literally friends with these people they'd be more than happy to send you know about 10 to 20 patients a week to try not just to do consults. She would not need to split any fee because she'd be off on her own without any doctors provision. That's what I like do procedures she can't do anything else obviously.
00:11:26 - Chona Sweet
I can do trigger points.
00:11:29 - mark sweet
You're not flying up to see how to do it right away. It doesn't make sense.
00:11:32 - Chona Sweet
Yeah.
00:11:34 - mark sweet
Because we'd have to find a surgery center or an office and it comes with its own liability and everything else.
00:11:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean but what if there's a good song skiing?
00:11:44 - mark sweet
You would have to find rent out medical spaces expensive.
00:11:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:11:49 - mark sweet
Jeez. Whatever.
00:11:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not saying that it couldn't happen in the future but for the short cut. No, no, no. I mean you know I'm joking obviously.
00:11:58 - Chona Sweet
But these are options. I mean again if she gets busy No, up there to go up there twice a week to go and do procedures that she can earn more for than.
00:12:04 - mark sweet
Yeah, it does make sense. The issue is trigger points only pay about 800 each, and she's going to about 450 for a console and trigger points take out as much if not more time.
00:12:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice click and do you and I know the answer to this, but I'm going to ask it anyway, have a spreadsheet with all of the income earning opportunities and that makes some basic calculations on what can happen. Then roughly how long each of those procedures or types of income opportunities take to fulfill so that you can figure out roughly what the earning potential is.
00:12:40 - mark sweet
In my head, because there's the same limitation that kind of Fuji has, she can really only see about 400 patients in a month, more than that you start paying for that.
00:12:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:12:51 - mark sweet
so, part of the benefit with being under the doctor in California is the doctor's going to be signing their reports and records so it allows her to have a little bit more flexibility and to make It's kind of like cheating, I guess, to be able to see more people, not really cheating, but...
00:13:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or you could see 400 people and try to get them to come back for other like follow-ups and whatnot.
00:13:12 - mark sweet
More procedures and things. problem on the legal side is this, because the limits are what they are, there are times where you just, even though they may need that procedure, there's not enough money to get that to actually happen.
00:13:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it's 400 in a month, right?
00:13:28 - Chona Sweet
It's not just 400 you've ever seen per person.
00:13:31 - mark sweet
Per month.
00:13:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Per month, okay. month, yes. So then, how have we covered all the income-earning things?
00:13:40 - mark sweet
I felt like we did. Those are the three for her. The only other one for me is essentially what we've talked about with Dan is building out a better software, a better way to do this. With Sime, I report writing that could get away with a lot of the issues that we're seeing like Dr. E and somebody's being Dr.
00:13:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Suffer from. I think that this Steph, me working with Chona is actually probably going to help expedite that. I'll see things that in a different way. So then Chona, let me get to know you a little bit. And now the one thing that I that stood out to me that I was that I'm kind of holding on to is that this is a fulfillment kind of thing like that you didn't really necessarily want before, but do which is like having something of your own, having purpose, not just work, you know, but like something that you're proud of, something that you that you do. But what else could you succinctly kind of summarize what was the catalyst for starting this, what were the things that were happening inside of you that made you say, I'm ready. I want to do that. is because you still obviously have some overwhelm and so not being sure about things, but obviously have enough faith and Mark and in yourself to want to proceed with this. kind of help me figure out like imagine and be there with you when you're like, okay, I am ready and I'm all in.
00:15:23 - Chona Sweet
What was that I think, I'm not sure if Mark mentioned JP, honey. That's so we recently completed more of a kind of individual coaching type service and we it basically helped me I think that'll put it me into myself that I didn't know is there or has always been there but I I just, it's just wake that, you know, passion up again from me. I feel like I've always been passionate and with my career and then life happens. I think I think after my dad passed in 2020, I lost that passion and then, you know, there's some psychological depression with that brief. And, you know, after that coaching, I just have this renewed passion, you know, within myself. And it's like perfect time, you know, when I say it's like just how it happens. Yeah, the coaching finish. And then would you say, mean, a few weeks before I finish, Mark has been talking to Dr. E. So, and then Dr. E again recommended or ask Mark, do you think Jonah would want to? I don't know if I know, you know, the background. I know Dr. E from my previous work. He's a fellow. He's a doctor in training way back in 20 I don't know, 17 2016 no 2014 2015 so he's fellow and I'm a nurse practitioner, but that's how we met with Dr. E at Theodore Sinai And then I introduced him to mark because he the moment he graduated he wanted to hire me That's one of the NPS that I'm not sure. don't want to work too hard And then I introduced him to mark and they clicked cuz they're both you know have that business mentality and Ever since he's been asking me and I said no no no no I don't do this I'm I have an employee mindset I don't think I have no clue anything about business or anything like that. And then finally, I think it's just that, you know, that timing with my personal coach and then Mark talking to him and I didn't even realize that I'll have a second or I have another job at this time. This is not part of the plan. What you mean another job? I mean not another job, I mean a different job, I mean leaving my previous job because this is a new job for me, so.
00:18:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. What were you doing before? Like were you?
00:18:38 - Chona Sweet
I'm still an I'm a nurse practitioner but more of an internist in a psych hospital.
00:18:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
00:18:46 - mark sweet
Wasn't the last what you're in, you're in a half?
00:18:49 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, the last year and a half, like I started part time with them in late 2022 while I was at UCI doing pain management and then I become time of last year of February. Then I've been doing that. Um, but prior to that, I've been doing pain management since 2013. Since I've become a nurse practitioner in 2013. I've been doing pain management. then I said, I don't want to do pain management anymore. I want something different, more challenging. And it definitely challenged me. biggest population is very challenging, but someone has to, you know, take care of those patients. Again, mental health is the taboo, still even on the medical fields, but in no one needs to help those patients. you know, it's definitely challenging. and then this opportunity arrived and then on the timing of the personal coaching, I said, you know what, not? Well, why can I see that person that can make more that I didn't even realize I can? Obviously, obviously with Mark, I guess. push gentle push like you can do this you believe in what i can do so that helps so what parts of it um excite you the most um the autonomy has always been there that's why i became an arch practitioner that's why i went back to you know getting my master's and doctors like i wanted to be a economist like that that's the driving factor and just in context i left UCI even though i'm paying good money i mean okay money i don't think i feel that they're paying me too much because they're not utilizing my full of potential and i don't like that that's why i left that job and that's why i went to the internist position which even though i'm very autonomous it's a very it's scary you know you have to always I'm back with this patient's mark is always kind of worried that I would come one time I came home with a scratch in my face like the patient do that just like no it's either you know it's a high stress environment but so you and money I mean if you're asking about that the income potential is there 100 percent I mean I'm gonna lie it's not if that's not it but it's more I think the autonomy and the fulfillment of utilizing to my fullest potential trumps the money because if it's really money that I'm talking about like UCI would have been perfect yeah I was just gonna say that doesn't make any sense that money would be even in the top because if you left because they're paying you too much and not using you then your perceived value is more important to you like I think so right Hans because remember how I would always complain that I feel like I'm um, what's that term used? I'm a glorified babysitter. babysitter.
00:22:09 - mark sweet
You're helping the residents at UCI because, you know, they're doing doctors and they don't know what they don't know. And while you enjoy teaching, it was just kind of a, you were there just to make sure they didn't screw up something.
00:22:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so money's definitely not your main driver.
00:22:26 - Chona Sweet
You, you want to serve a purpose.
00:22:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, you might like it, but if she made that decision, money can't be the main driver.
00:22:35 - Chona Sweet
It might be closed, but it can't it's definitely, there's that component of the incompotential of making what two doctors can make in a year. It's definitely there, you know, like I'm gonna lie. But if you tell me that I will be working as what I do at UCI and be a glorified assistant and not utilizing my potential, I will not be happy.
00:23:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Even if I make that much money. So I'm just gonna delineate the difference between making a lot of money and earning a lot of money. So earning a lot of money is important to you. Making a lot of money is not as much. Right. The difference is just it's slight but it's important. Mark, are you laughing about?
00:23:26 - mark sweet
I don't know, like it's nice things. I do.
00:23:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's okay. But it's still that it's not the same. When you tie how you get the money, that matters.
00:23:38 - Chona Sweet
Right. That's that's what I'm saying. That's right for me to even say I felt that I'm getting paid. I'm getting I'm paying they're overpaying yet you said because they're not doing what I'm supposed to do. I feel like that's a good feeling.
00:23:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean if your husband gives you all the things you you are that because you married him.
00:24:00 - mark sweet
So No, we're not.
00:24:02 - Chona Sweet
No, we're not.
00:24:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, we're to see you open this kind of words. Okay.
00:24:06 - mark sweet
Hey, she should make double what she's been making before. The other thing too is, when I tell Med Park, it's more and more robust. It does allow us more flexibility, but from a location standpoint, as well as, you know, a time standpoint. So if we want to travel or one of the other things for kids or whatever else, it gives us more options in terms of working time. And so it's not just a single income leader, know, anything else, trying to instill earn her income and what have you while being able from home or being able to work from wherever we are.
00:24:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:24:40 - Chona Sweet
So freedom. Yes, I like that.
00:24:43 - mark sweet
Yeah. So all these things kind of come together. And the timing was good.
00:24:46 - Chona Sweet
Dr. He's been trying to recruit her for years because he doesn't have to train her.
00:24:50 - mark sweet
And, you know, he's like, make, he's definitely more business focused, but it's kind of raining.
00:24:55 - Chona Sweet
He's all over the place. Oh my gosh. He is.
00:24:58 - mark sweet
Because he just takes on every project.
00:25:00 - Chona Sweet
which is okay but you know he needs people who can do what they need to do and so it's a great learning opportunity and she's going to have more opportunity than she would if she joined you know like any other paint tops that it would work like this procedure I've never done this before but doing procedures which I am very much this is what I'm saying like utilizing to my fullest potential although California we I still need it in collaboration with a physician but this is just the first time after 11 years of the nurse practitioner so first time I'm doing a procedure which is you know it's great it's amazing you like learning yeah yes I do I do and yeah all right so now I understand the why and the what a little bit and now we got to kind of figure out the how that works with chona so the thing and I was talking to you about this last week chona
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the mind is that the beginning is always the hardest, but what I can tell you and hopefully Mark can testify to is that when we really break it down and look at everything, what we're doing is we're going to be looking for leverage and optimization. So what that looks like is for example, you know, seeing more patients in one location, but there's going to be so many things that you're doing that from communication, travel, how certain locations operate, how you plan your day as well as how you start your day. Mark used to start it by checking his phone every first thing in the morning and get stressed out about something that went wrong or whatever, just immediately like it pumps cortisol into our bodies that that's stress of like there's something to do and I'm just like, can you just not look at your phone for a little bit and see how that goes and started working Dolce and there were some improvement. It's like the little things. It's not just the person doing business is the most important part of the business. So we'll talk about a lot of different things and it will start with a lot of questions. So the first step is you've got to get your head wrapped around everything and then you've got to be able to communicate to me enough so that I can get my around everything and so then we can start working together. So it is slow and kind of tedious and overwhelming in the beginning which is why I said you can also feel free to just vent send messages and just kind of vent because even in that venting I'll learn some things I'll learn about you know what's happening and the faster the more we communicate in the beginning the faster I'll be able to get to something useful for you. My standard It is I just talked to people once a week. Although I do tell them hey, you can reach out to me. Nobody does So it takes a long time.
00:28:06 - mark sweet
think you run in photo stuff.
00:28:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know I know thank you so much I love that doggy. I do take doggy payments Yeah, so You know something was just on your mind and you like this happened and I don't know where to put it I don't want to hold on to it You can tell anybody or you can tell me like I said you can just leave me like a voice You know you have an eye called to right Audio messengers are so great because then it does the dictation and I can just read it if I can't listen at the moment And so I will encourage you share as much as you feel like sharing Because the sooner I get all of that the faster will get there Um because I don't even know What questions to ask right now other than mark The fastest way is to get something that we can all look at so we can on same page, right, which is where, what are the offices, what are the opportunities, what are the procedures, what are the all the things. And it seems very tedious and Mark doesn't like tedious, but we can do another group call and I can extract it and I can create the spreadsheet myself. That's totally fine. But and that process actually works really well for me, Mark, because then I'm getting it firsthand and when I'm putting stuff in this spreadsheet, then I wrap my head around it. So what we could do is just schedule a couple more of these calls until I got my head wrapped around all of the opportunities to even start to formulate the questions. And you know how it goes and Mark can explain this to you is the more that we look at, the more we talk about the more that we see, the more the questions formulate, the more you just don't even know what you don't know. So it's a lot of asking questions and then it's just kind of a rough. It's not really fancy and it's not shiny and it's not exciting, but it gets some results and hopefully it'll help you be peaceful sooner rather than later.
00:30:14 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, I feel like everything is up in there. I'm getting used to the flow of the number one, the main traditional, that's what Ricky's He's going to put me because he's really all over the place. He's spread him to the food and he's about to take on a really large contract.
00:30:38 - mark sweet
He's not always going to fulfill it.
00:30:41 - Chona Sweet
So she puts her in Long Beach, which is probably busiest hospital, I would say. Sorry. like my mind no no I have to initiate a lot so like what I feel like I am he doesn't have any plan for me whatsoever I I told him is it okay with you you know being respectful I will shadow this NP you know because I want to know how they do it because the office manager which is Mark's Mary I don't know if you know her but the office manager would tell me don't do how doctor eat that because he does it may definitely you do it the right way so I have to shadow everyone else because I need to know the right way more efficient way so that's what I did yesterday he didn't tell me I have to tell him like I'm doing this is that okay with you sure that's why everything I said sure so I can see myself as my goal knowing what I'm where I am now is I wanted to make sure that the Long Beach Memorial, it will be, I will have, I want to have my roots basically there. Rather than running around, he wants to have a lot of patience, right? don't have that many right now. That's where I wanted to be. If we can get 30 patients a day at Long Beach, that would be nice. Right now, like yesterday, it's less than 20. not a lot. And I just paid per patient. So.
00:32:27 - mark sweet
So she gets between 20 to 30 a patient. So the goals between 30 to 50 patients. And there's not a limit on the number of patients she can see in the traditional sense.
00:32:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So that, all of that is really helpful. And I like that it's going to serve you really well that you recognize his shortcomings and aren't adopting that. Like that, that autonomy, of course, you would want it because you already see how you could do something better or improve.
00:33:01 - Chona Sweet
I already made a suggestion on how to increase, and he's like, oh yeah, we didn't do that, like, okay, this is gonna be a process. I feel like whatever I make decide, as long as it's obviously politically okay, he will say yes, so I have to make sure that we set up dark roots at Long Beach Tomorrow, so that we can see at least 30 a day, that's a goal.
00:33:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And Mark, how fast can you help, like you said, you know, lots of people.
00:33:35 - mark sweet
I'm holding that back until their systems and reports and processes are right because you get only really one chance at it, right?
00:33:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, your reputation.
00:33:45 - mark sweet
Hundreds of other opportunities plus my own personal reputation side into it. So the good news is he already has some PI patients coming in again from what he's doing before. So trying to cut her teeth on those, she doesn't get the same payout. She'll get like more of the traditional payout, but at least. she can cut her teeth, get under control, get the report writing right, figure out how to actually do a better job making sure patients show up because that's a huge issue for this doctor's office. Now on insurance, they're not showing up, it's actually better for him from an insurance perspective because he's paid a flat rate per month.
00:34:20 - Chona Sweet
I don't think about the procedure though.
00:34:23 - mark sweet
No, no, no, no, procedure will get a little more, but like if a patient doesn't show up to the office on the insurance side for him, he's happier, quite frankly. On the PI side, the personal injury side, that means you're not making any money, any wasted time.
00:34:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there's that follow up automation thing that we need to set up.
00:34:46 - Chona Sweet
So okay, he's not very, he's not good, his system is not good. He's hiring more people. There's a lot of non-PI patients that come that they can't get through the phone. So whatever the second income that Mark is saying with the lead, I will have to also drive that and making sure that I am calling, that you're going to have a procedure in this day and make sure you come.
00:35:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In the interim, would it make any sense to do what Fuji is doing and have an offshore kind of team that just does those calls? Because the automations will work better because we can do the text, email call, follow up and it should be cost effective. Plus, we can do all the tracking. But in the interim, without risking your reputation, Mark, and without tona having to be the one to call everybody because that is not the best use of your brain and your time.
00:35:51 - mark sweet
For the problem, we've used Dr.
00:35:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
E before in the past.
00:35:55 - mark sweet
Now, some these have been problems, which tona will be writing them and maybe in. They're okay. It took us multiple months to get signed bills and reports back from him to the point where like a lawyer sued him over and he called me to like to try to get him out of it because he opened for coaching and getting his stuff organized and set out because super busy like I not not yet he's he's going to take over the role mode still.
00:36:23 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, that he's in that mood. They keep would care about what everyone say or he doesn't have any ego.
00:36:29 - mark sweet
He's very nice person.
00:36:31 - Chona Sweet
He just wants to get paid. just wants money.
00:36:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Chaos doesn't take over the world.
00:36:35 - mark sweet
Chaos blows up the world. And the VA thing, we're getting more and more negative feedback from whether it's Fuji or other people who are using it that they really don't like the VA who doesn't know what's going on and a large accent issue. It's a great idea in theory, but I think is you're trying to scale it unless you have the right VA is a balance and issues. So because the volume for P is low. I'm going to believe we're in do everything yourself first so you know how to do it also. Oh, yeah. But until then long term that is not the solution I've shown on calling and setting up that's not the solution.
00:37:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The answer is I do it. We do it. You do it. It's the way to go. It's what I do too. Okay, so do we have other ideas for how to get more more people per day without someone having to call everybody or is that just that's what has to happen right now.
00:37:32 - mark sweet
So right now in my mind is get her feet under her for at least the next like 30 days.
00:37:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:37:39 - mark sweet
Yeah. Get in your sway. Get in going. Right now she's on prescription running power because everything has to get approved. Like you have to get what's it called for the hospital again?
00:37:50 - Chona Sweet
There's a for any doctor to anyone that can there's a process called getting a privilege in the hospital. So it's more thorough, not just background checks, just more deeper kind of employment, I guess, background checks that they do and it takes a while. So now it's been over a month now from Long Beach, so that will take a while. I'm hoping this month it will be done. Is that what you're saying here?
00:38:23 - mark sweet
Yeah, so again, we can't even really get a lot of stuff started till she's got some of these basic things.
00:38:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, that's what I was trying to figure out is like, what's the timeline? So if we spend the next, let's say roughly four weeks meeting, if you're willing to come at least for the next couple mark, because yes. So then we can spend like the next couple calls really kind of extracting the the plan, all the the income opportunities, and I'll put it in a dashboard that will make sense. So we can do some calculations and forecasting for some. potential there. And then Chona can give us that insight about what it's like on the inside, how long these things take, how efficient this process is, how inefficient this process is, and really just kind of take inventory and stock of the operation side of it. And then what we do Chona is just kind of, you know, merge and optimize operations with the financial opportunities together. And where we've got the simplest process to get the most amount of money where those two intersect, that's the most leveraged income. So again, it's a lot of gathering, but gathering from from different aspects. So getting marks kind of planned, your information, feed on the ground, and I'll put it together and organize. And then while you're getting your, you know, why you're just getting used to doing it, and we'll be gathering the data that will then help us to create this strategic plan of Okay. Here's what we do for the next 60, 90 days. Then we do that thing, right? we're observing it as it happens, kind of tracking what's happening as we're doing it. Is it going according to plan? What else are we learning, implementing and inserting that data into what we're tracking? And just, it's an iterative process. So we start with gathering information, sort it, make a plan, and wash runs repeat constantly.
00:40:27 - Chona Sweet
So as of right now, I know that I will be my native Friday. Since I don't have the privilege in the hospital yet, I would do clinics and telemedicine. So that's where I'm at right now on the traditional, on the number one, the main job, basic breath, the main job. The second job mark is holding that back until I'm ready. In the meantime, what I'm doing with that is I'm attending Choice Hall and hopefully where we can be a member soon so I can have access to their ideal note system that way I can incorporate that soon. In the meantime, Marcus is helping me. I show him my notes of the lead, the PI patient, and he tells me this is good, this is not good. And I'm in collaboration with Dr. E to make that better. But all of these, I'm going to have to drive it. It's too busy. Dr. E still busy with this. And the third one, Washington, I have yet to submit the application for what we call reciprocity. Since I'm with that, I have to, I'm licensed in California. I don't have to take the test. I just need to apply. So that's what's going on.
00:41:45 - mark sweet
Question or question of question of question of yet. If we don't do that soon or you have to have Dr. E. Vouch that you have for an active practice in California either he doesn't need to be involved with the reciprocity of Washington, like I just need to apply.
00:42:00 - Chona Sweet
and it will take a month at least to get that.
00:42:04 - mark sweet
We're seeing like three months usually in the doctors.
00:42:07 - Chona Sweet
Oh, Well, the doctors are probably different than the board of nursing. So I don't know, but it will be the board of nursing. But I feel like the Washington one would be the highest potential for income because I don't have to split that with him, with anyone. So I'm excited with that part. I thought she thinks.
00:42:30 - mark sweet
Well, maybe again, you don't to split it. So her, yes, but volume is going to be the question in the problem. Right. So if there's more volume and more procedures in California, she would make more from the California and Dr. E. Yeah, despite having a split because it all just comes down to volume. And I don't have a lot of volume in Washington.
00:42:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know a couple people, but it takes time to spread. Right. And everybody being, you know, having the same type of thought about it. we create the spreadsheet that I'm talking about, Shona, and having all of that, it's going to make all of that easier because we're going to be looking at it mathematically with just really simple numbers, and it's almost kind of polarizing when you see the different opportunities and the things that happen. So it's not so much like that.
00:43:20 - mark sweet
This too is we would still want her to do some of the traditional because it just makes everything else look more legit. Take Fuji, for example, I know keep going back to him I follow it, but he's got the Q and E work, not only makes him money but makes it look more legitimate because Q and E is generally defensive minded. So it makes him look like he's more fair and balanced. If she's doing also mostly health insurance and working through hospitals, it makes it look like she's primarily a primary trader.
00:43:49 - Chona Sweet
Okay, like how Dr. E said it when he was the post and he was asked like this is the same thing I do with my other patients. It's the standard of care. Which is where I want to be. don't want anyone do anything illegal. Dr. E and I are very much in labor. We're not going to do anything, whether the lawyer says we have to do this.
00:44:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We have to stand on our medical beliefs and what is the standard of practice that's where we're at. Good and I mean, it's not philosophy that ever comes up in Sweet Law, but one of my just kind of like principles is have an unimpeachable character, meaning that you do the same thing everywhere you go, no matter what. I will punch an old man in church if he's invading in space and they're like, I don't care. that's not a good example, but it kind of means that even when I'm in the house of God, if somebody is doing something that makes me uncomfortable, I'm going to handle it the same way. Right. you act the same all the time, you treat your patients the same with integrity, obviously honoring the Hippocratic oath and just being there. to do good, then nothing really holds up unless you're just being taxed crazily for some reason.
00:45:07 - Chona Sweet
So however much and organized Dr. E.S. his patients love him. Like he is a good doctor. Like he goes beyond like sometimes the patient is scheduled for example for epidural injections and they don't need trigger point. Trigger point is another payment. He'll waive that. That's the kind of person he is. And I'm actually, I saw it before when he's in training. I know he's a good person, but seeing it now for him 10 years later, it feels good to be working with that kind of person.
00:45:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. All right, now I'm getting a whole kind of picture. And of course, just mark over there being a nice guy with nice people and nice sweet wife.
00:45:51 - Chona Sweet
I do like and she's cute.
00:45:57 - mark sweet
I'm super excited. And so are MPs and people who run businesses too, so you know, yeah, I do I do have friends.
00:46:04 - Chona Sweet
I can I see them their growth and Although I don't want it to say I mean, yes, I see them I get jealous, but I I accepted early on that that's not the path I chose, but now I can say hey I can do this too, okay Yeah, well even in my world I'm in business and I've made people millions and millions and millions and there are female counterparts that I've made way More money than me, but I've had more time with my kids and I coached soccer and I've done all kinds of other things And that was my priority and I picked them up from school.
00:46:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got them up I made them breakfast I went to school three or four times because somebody forgot a notebook lunch or this thought the other and that was my Priority that was what I wanted to do so every night I got that twins, but you pick you pick what you want and there's different seasons in life So you're in a new season and it's fun and exciting and Mark's got people to help you out and you've got people to help you out and you're, you're gonna do awesome. I'm Yeah, I'm so grateful.
00:47:05 - Chona Sweet
Like I told him. I'm so thankful again. I feel tired today. But again, after I talk to you, I feel re-energized.
00:47:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was, I was dragging. I was like, I'm going to pass out. As soon as this call is over, I was ready to fall asleep. So like, Yay, thanks for that mark, too.
00:47:28 - mark sweet
Yeah, I mean, look, this should be good. There's a lot of options here. You know, like to have multiple fasts, not just one. I like it. Flexibility is large.
00:47:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
still want to see the doggy thing happen one day, the doggy food and doggy health.
00:47:45 - mark sweet
I know it has to make money first and be a proven concept and you're not ready. It will happen. This is something that I care a lot about. So, you know, it's about me like when I'm focused, general contestants, but like when I focus on something, it will happen. It doesn't matter how difficult it is.
00:47:59 - Chona Sweet
It happens. It's not a matter of if it's when.
00:48:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I love that tenacity. Okay, well, I don't have any more questions, but I don't know what I don't know, so I don't know if there's something I should ask that I didn't ask. I feel like this was a good start, but anybody have anything else to bring up?
00:48:21 - Chona Sweet
No. I really know my role.
00:48:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You want me to get the operations on my end so I can input it. I just want you to get your footing. I just want you to do what you're already doing, which is noticing what's working well, what's not working well, and get comfortable and then relay that information and that process back. And I want you to not overthink it. Okay, that will really stress you out a lot. I just really just show up, do your best, and know that you're going to make an impact for him, which is going to make an impact for the patient, and you're also going to be able to earn money that makes you feel good because you will know when you earn.
00:49:00 - Chona Sweet
it.
00:49:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, and just enjoy the process as much as you can. Shoot schedule. So you're gonna have to have evenings for the foreseeable future, is that right?
00:49:14 - Chona Sweet
I think, I think for right now, that's what I'm seeing.
00:49:19 - mark sweet
So, would you rather try to do a morning or no?
00:49:22 - Chona Sweet
I think the moment, like I was telling Tina, the moment I know the assigned patients to me, if I, I think once I get the hospital work done, and then I would know my schedule, like I would know how, because it's just right now, it's still up in there.
00:49:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're the only person in the world, I would be the selectable for, but I'm going to be the selectable them.
00:49:44 - mark sweet
going to the to the selectable I'm going the selectable them.
00:49:48 - Chona Sweet
don't have any, like, what I'm saying is, I feel like you have like a midday even in the clinic, there's a lunch break, but I'm saying that if I have you, two, then I can push back the hospital. What I'm saying is I can go after. Like, again, the only one with the scheduling is the clinic. If they scheduled patients for me during this time, time frame, so that would be it. But the hospital, I have no time there. I would go when I can. If I go early, some doctors go at five a.m. a.m. the patient. Like, like, I don't want to do that. mean, I'm not going to wake up the patient.
00:50:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so right now you are at the hospital every day.
00:50:31 - Chona Sweet
No, not right now. still don't have access. I don't know the moment that I get that. I'm I'm assuming. I mean, I'm not. I'm hoping it will be soon because I I did the process in less than a day.
00:50:48 - mark sweet
Mark knows and everything. Yeah, it's just we're just waiting for approval.
00:50:52 - Chona Sweet
We're just waiting.
00:50:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's just waiting at this point. Well, do you want to schedule a week to week for right now, then? If that's okay. Yeah, let's do that. So next week, I have my girls for the weekend, so I like to keep Fridays open. And the week after that, I'm traveling, but we're not going to talk about the week after that yet. So how about next week, Thursday evening?
00:51:13 - Chona Sweet
that work? Yeah, that's okay. Are you okay there?
00:51:20 - mark sweet
I just have something from four to five, but that's it.
00:51:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We don't know.
00:51:29 - mark sweet
You have to come in the evening anyway, right?
00:51:33 - Chona Sweet
Like after that, Shona? Yeah, I'm, I'm the director say evening, if that's okay with you.
00:51:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, yeah, so like six or like what time?
00:51:43 - mark sweet
I think six, it's just mark that I don't know what time mark is okay. Yeah.
00:51:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, well, we said, so I'm assuming that you're not available until evening.
00:51:55 - Chona Sweet
When are you first available and like you have time, you'd be ready for tab a call. I think. I Thursday, I should be available, again, because I don't know my schedule yet, I should be available after five.
00:52:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's what I must, you know.
00:52:12 - Chona Sweet
Okay, I'm just assuming office hours because I like today.
00:52:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so let's shoot for six o'clock and if we need to adjust it, we'll adjust it.
00:52:24 - Chona Sweet
Okay.
00:52:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so it will be the same line and we'll plan on meeting at six and I'll send the calendar invite and then next week we will talk about the following week. Okay. And so next week, Mark, whatever you need to have access to or be looking at to be able to feed me information about income opportunities, specifically, like, is actual data as possible.
00:53:00 - mark sweet
I know it's more theoretical unfortunately.
00:53:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, that's fine too. Whatever we have to start with, but my point is that if you can just have yourself either mentally ready, if you have to be at a computer, just whatever, that be able to have that type of conversation will be really useful.
00:53:16 - mark sweet
Look at your word response, Fred.
00:53:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She just has the general numbers, but who can kind of them? That's an better start. Okay, I am so excited.
00:53:24 - Chona Sweet
Trona, do you have any questions? No.
00:53:27 - mark sweet
Did she hear dogs?
00:53:28 - Chona Sweet
She has dogs.
00:53:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, what? They are not here. They are feeding with fluffy dogs. I have a poussaint. She's a poodle and a bee shan and I have a havinese boy. And the poodle has purple and blue hair dye right now because my daughter loves to be ticker to the beach and her hair was just flowing and the little kids are just like, oh it's a rainbow puppy. We love dogs. And we have birds in a bearded dragon also, so what I was a dad And the bearded dragon he's like this big and he loves to just hang out on shoulders and do you see He's I feed it with life In pics, uh, well he gets freeze dried mealworms. He loves blueberries. He loves kale Oh, Sometimes we will get him live prickets. Yeah, that's my daughter. I like lizards in the wild They're very adorable in the wild. Yes I don't think he should be in a cage. Anyway, I don't like cage down Tina is a big fan of the dog food idea Yeah, um dogs. Okay. I'm not going to cry.
00:54:45 - Chona Sweet
So we're gonna talk about something else Yeah, yeah, I'm excited for this.
00:54:51 - mark sweet
I'm for showing.
00:54:51 - Chona Sweet
I'm excited for you know the future I feel like there's dr. A like we're gonna start slow, but then there's a part of me that I'm good I'm ready to go like, you know, like, but then he I think it's in my head and I kind of verbalize it, but we'll take it slow, and it's like, okay.
00:55:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't always don't take anything slow.
00:55:14 - Chona Sweet
They go.
00:55:16 - mark sweet
It's the idea of slow, but it's not crap. This happens and now we're, yeah, we're.
00:55:21 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, the moment that he have at least 6,000 new ones coming in this October, they're already trickling in. So we'll see how that goes.
00:55:30 - mark sweet
new patient's starting in two weeks. Yeah. What? It's like 10 plus people before then.
00:55:36 - Chona Sweet
Well, let's say, and not all of them are paying patients to collect chronic pain. So let's say at least, I don't know, 30% are on chronic, have chronic pain. But basically any one of them that have pain issue, they can't, they will come to us. So, there's that, there's that new thing too that I will, my name. It will be one of the top again, because I'm paying, I'm going to to push out a lot of narcotics, so there's that too. I'm not thrilled, but I'm comfortable if that makes sense, because it's my speciality, but yeah, it's just what it is.
00:56:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good.
00:56:19 - Chona Sweet
Buckle up, lady.
00:56:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh. All right, well, I am looking forward to it. And I think just a little bit, I've been able to talk to you. I can tell that you are made of some exceptional stuff, and that you're about to be tried in the fire. yeah, but my favorite thing about it is it feels amazing to know what you're made of, but you can talk about what you're made of all day long, and you can feel it inside of yourself. Until you get tested, you don't really know. And the tests are painful, but they come with a level of conviction that nobody can shake. Nobody can make you feel less than when you've done. and the really hard work. And so I'm excited for you to feel a whole new kind of level of who you are and what you're made of.
00:57:08 - Chona Sweet
Right. Thank you.
00:57:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. The eyebrows mark.

Hi, Tina.
00:00:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm sorry. I'm late. No problem. I wasn't sure because I changed the meeting and I didn't see if you accepted.
00:00:08 - Laura L
So I was like, well, we'll see if she comes or not. Yeah, I forget to accept it. And I just noticed, I think yesterday and we got to accept the invitation.
00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, good. Well, I mean, you know what I mean, but I'm glad it worked out.
00:00:23 - Laura L
Thank you.
00:00:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. How are you doing?
00:00:28 - Laura L
Doing well.
00:00:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How about yourself? Good. So try to think really there. don't think there was much of an assignment other than just to keep figuring out is like refining the theme and the template. Oh, actually, let me go look in trouble. No, we didn't have something.
00:00:50 - Laura L
Yeah, I think I changed it back. mean, for the WordPress. Yeah, I'm sorry.
00:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my god, I didn't know what to have. Animation.
00:01:03 - Laura L
Yeah, animation. I changed it back.
00:01:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it looks good. It looks different than the first time, though. It's like, I think there was a different color in there before, also, or something.
00:01:18 - Laura L
Yeah, I think I have to maybe the width. I make it, like, where is that?
00:01:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like it, though. I like it, and it doesn't seem like it looks quite as much as James, which is what the point was.
00:01:32 - Laura L
Yeah, and on mobile, also, it doesn't look so wider.
00:01:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, good. Yeah, he has three colors in his. So, too, let me look at it on mobile.
00:01:53 - Laura L
You could actually put another color if you want, like, the orange, or. I mean the yellow one, or the Bruffet Triber's color, brand color.
00:02:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, um, hold on a second, I'm trying to get to this shot. I want to see it on mobile and my brain can't do. Ooh, that does look cool. That looks a lot better on mobile. Well, I mean, it almost looks like an ocean. Like ocean waves. Yeah, um, which now makes me want to see about it being two blues instead. Oh, we'll figure out the colors later. I just know we can do that. It's good. Okay, let me go. hold on. Can't, where's the workspaces? that's weird it says Laura and Tina but it also says Cindy and Laura oh yeah it's really what happened to me yeah I'm gonna sort this out I'm not sure what's happening it's maybe because if I'm on free workspace but I could yeah look at it and change like went to the wrong way yeah I just want to make sure like if you have another project that you're working on that your your stuff is I know it's even a lot you chose a domain oh okay so one thing I did do was change the name servers from profit drivers oh I might need you for this but hold on um profit drivers IO to what it needs to be for postidium, but I was having an issue with the subdomain, so hang on, let me log into the last pass.
00:04:15 - Laura L
So you could actually just add domain in the tnomerii.io, so we could have the domain for profit drivers, and would be needing to import the files?
00:04:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I don't want to use tnomerii for any of this. Okay, I don't really know that I want to do any kind of brand, any kind of work around my name yet, but I do want to do it around the brand name, so it'll be profit drivers. So, let's see. So the issue is, we have member dot, members dot, profit drivers. I was getting a sight can't be reached and let me just change, so we can be on the same thing, okay. So I don't remember how I set up this subdomain.
00:05:46 - Laura L
I think need to go to domain tab and then add domain or configure at the bottom.
00:05:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah, okay, configure just. Okay, let's just remove it. And then we'll create a new one. The other thing that I need to do is it's the SSL wasn't working redirects to members. Okay. All right. add domain members. It's being provisioned. so I don't know how long it'll take. Mm hmm. Um. Yeah, I saw. don't know. Let's see. shouldn't need to do that. So these are pointed at. Presidium, but names that I could see didn't allow me to create the subdomain there. I'll log in there in case, because I was the one who did it. So I figured it out at one point, but my brain was like, no, every time, man.
00:07:20 - Laura L
I think it is also annoying because when I can't see that you already disabled the two F8, but it still won't allow me to log in without the OTP.
00:07:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Do you know? Go. Let's see. I just changed his password. See when it was added. I don't know. Oh, okay, copy. Yep, that was the problem I had last time. So this is so annoying. Let's see. I can't see when it was last updated. I don't want to deal with resetting it again. It's really been annoying. Um, mm, Let's do learn dot. I'll put drivers dot IO. See, we can do that. And to your domain name. I'll put drivers dot. Wait, I need to do that. Okay. This up domain, right? I don't want to add additional options, okay, so those should already be there. Let's get it right to turn on the website, enable htts, yes, force redirect to htts, it's encrypt, okay, oop, all right, mh, I don't know if that's new. No CBN. No redirects come bigger. And then we'll see the end. And then we'll see the end. See if we've got to know. Yeah, that's because it's the, um, what do you call it? I can't get this stinking zoom window to move. But anyway, um, um, See, it says SSL is force reader. correct? So I don't know. Maybe you can reach out to their support because that's how I got SSL fixed last time. And if we can't figure out how, I really would like it to be, I don't know, don't know. anyway, use their support if you can to make sure that we figure out how to set up the name servers with namecheap. So, because I tried to figure it out, set up some
00:12:00 - Laura L
I think it wouldn't ask you to add like a name and C name for a subtle name. Yeah.
00:12:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. That might make sense. It used to be. You just do it in C panel. Look at this. You can even find that. Yeah. Any point of something that used to be created inside. As far as I'm put into the names first. About. New record, I think you're right. Parking dot name sheet and then. But it's. You have to point them. What you're saying to me. Well, that goes. Okay. English record. No. A record. Enter host. Oh, that's where you put it. Yeah. then how do I point it? Or will it just go to where the main domain is? Okay. Okay. Oh, because it already knows that that's the domain. Oh, right. Well, that makes sense because at NWWW, okay. The last time I created this domain, it was just like a CPanel thing or something else where you just, it was basically software done and not new. I mean, a few years ago, nobody touched these records except for certain types of hosting analysis. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. like everybody's got to have MX records and DKIM and everything else like yeah the controls have changed so much yeah all right let me I know my user name user names from my 1996 reset password um mmm cheap reset okay that's just generator copy boy boy change password okay and you didn't try to save it for me okay account I'm going to get to my authenticator. Let me see. Right. Okay. Um, um, um, don't me. Driver style image. That's DNS. Okay. I knew record a record. Um, dot. Uh, oh, wait. Okay. Not dot. So we need that. Automatic. And. record. I clicked too fast, um, one, type name, um, that's all I want to know. Okay.
00:16:15 - Laura L
Um, sometimes the propagate is really fast, so we'll see, well, yeah, what it meant me the C name record only the A record, no more C name. Um, what, and I mean, the C name or just only the A record, that's what we did.
00:16:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm still confused.
00:16:41 - Laura L
Try again. The, uh, usually it would have a, a record and then C name like, uh, so I need to add a C name, is that what you're telling me? Yeah, I'm just trying to confirm if, if that would be needed.
00:16:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, well, let's see, let's see, um, I don't know if it's. provisioned. Hey, that should be, oh, it redirected to profitdrivers.io. So, that shouldn't have happened though, because I don't have a redirect unless, yeah, not connected. You can figure any more issues for me to do that also. I don't know what that means. So, was there? Hey, record. I'll just go ahead and keep, we'll just play the rest of it. like one minute. Just a record blog, actually I think how is that, a name, see name, and URL records. Do you think it would hurt to create the CNAME record, like get in a way, like cause it to not work?
00:18:44 - Laura L
Yeah, I just thought maybe we could have to, but I think it won't mess up if there's anything there going on.
00:18:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Everything that I've looked up for CNAME servers has just been a record and a record at. host a record ww host, but there were no synoms records at all. So for the sub domain, I don't know though, but the sub domain has to be different anyways, so because the host is the sub domain. I don't know.
00:19:19 - Laura L
Maybe you can figure out that later and let's just have to, I mean, maybe need to research.
00:19:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, if you figured out and let me know, then I can do that. But name chief with a 2FA, I'll have to be the one to log into it anyway. So yeah, and it just takes a minute. So I can do that. But what I would like is to make sure that, oh, look, yeah, it's now connected. Oh, maybe it's not yet propagated when we did that. I'm going to try a Cockney and Cockney window, which is not being shared. Oops, that's not right. Mine's not perfect. It's still redirecting. Let me proceed. I don't know why it's redirecting, though, so that allowed rid of it. No, so this isn't set up to redirect, so I feel like either it's because it hasn't finished being provisioned. And so by default, it's redirecting, or we don't have the name server set, right? We have to have another record, maybe the C name record or the alias or something. No, it wouldn't be alias. Yeah, I don't know. I don't get any warnings on proper drivers, right? It should be okay. Yeah, so I just want to make sure that the SSL is configured properly. So if you could make a note to check that, okay, and then make sure that these are working and then you could install WordPress on this and this is where we would install Thinkific.
00:21:32 - Laura L
Okay. funnel?
00:21:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, um, Thinkific will be where we put the membership site is on learn.profitrivers.io. Uh, the sales page for funnel kit will be on proper drivers.io. Okay, gotcha. So the subdomain is only for member access and core stuff. and the sale step is on the home page and I think that's really it for right now. It's not a lot. It won't be a lot. I'm trying to. It's the end of the summer so there's so many things going on before the girls start school.
00:22:23 - Laura L
I see.
00:22:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so they don't start school for until the first week of September so we've got trips and activities and things planned and then I so I'm just working on my the course I've got an 82 page outline so it's it's there it's starting but I just have to sit down and get some some sort of finished level product and that I can't put a due date on I'm I keep trying but it's It's really hard because I prioritized girls and also the mission work that I'm doing, so. But yeah, anyway, but if we can get a simple site going and I know that there's a framework, then when Thinkific is there, I'll have a place to start putting some content and it's just kind of the way that my brain works. It's almost like, oh, there's a home, I can start filling it up, you know? Yeah, and that's what I'm looking forward to. That's what I've been telling myself, so we're going to see if it just lies to make myself a better, but I don't think so.
00:23:44 - Laura L
Yeah, I think if we can configure the domain, I could also start my group like import the funnel in there. Yeah, and press and then also for Thinkific, I was thinking if maybe worthy.
00:24:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tp issue if we can I mean for your email, maybe we could set up like a forward or for That like forward the OTP to my email if that would be okay So I want bothering bothering you if I would ask well It would be only so I checked into that and the only way I could do it is to forward all my email So okay, so there's no specific just only for the thing can be OTP right now Okay But when we get to the point of being able to sell it then I'll upgrade it to the higher level So we can have more access Yeah, but really it's not that big of a deal. I just need to be able to see the notifications and So like if you know you're gonna be online in like 15 minutes or in an hour or a few hours say Hey, will you be on at this time because I'm gonna need the password instead of because it's just been kind of hit or miss I'm around most of the time and if you send it through Slack and Upwork, sometimes I might miss one or they don't come through. Slack sometimes just doesn't come through. You have to do at Tina or I won't get notified. Yeah. if you send it through Upwork, because I get nothing through Upwork, otherwise, for the most part, it really stands out. But I need a little bit of time because sometimes I'm cleaning or doing one or like no longer than half an hour really. So if you know that you're going to work on that to say, hey, I'll be working in about half an hour and they just send a request. Okay. I'll do that. Okay. Because I don't check email very often. So the only time I even know that there's a request is if I saw it in my email unless you message first.
00:25:51 - Laura L
Okay. Yeah. Okay.
00:25:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there anything you want to do in that now?
00:25:56 - Laura L
you want me to do you need to code down? Yeah, I can do that now. Also, if one. Okay, let me like in 4D. Thank you. Oh, nice profit. Okay, but TP has been sent.
00:26:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. It's 579501.
00:26:42 - Laura L
All right, I'm in.
00:26:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Great. Okay. Um, well, we're just trying to close up. Oh, no, here it is.
00:26:57 - Laura L
I hope think you think we'd also have like the option. to remember the browser for 30 days.
00:27:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Um. Does it only think that does that? It's not your browser settings clearing cache.
00:27:18 - Laura L
Yeah. Really weird because you already disable the to F.A.
00:27:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But still working. Yeah, that's what's so weird about it. It's doing that to me too. So. Let me see.
00:28:16 - Laura L
I think I saw it in account and then profile. Oh, they are multi-factor authentication.
00:28:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Deactivated. These are roles. Just one thing. Oh, Okay. Okay. Thanks for watching! Okay, that's not working, so if you can save recovery codes, maybe if I turn it on and give you the recovery codes. What do you think? Yeah, okay. We can do that. In terms of like anything else that you want to work on, what do you think? What is it? Is there anything that you need for me in my brain as well?
00:30:48 - Laura L
Do you want me to like to research more like of the layout of the page, then I can just import or create or maybe import another one that we can choose from?
00:31:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that one looks really good.
00:31:04 - Laura L
Are you like it?
00:31:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. lot. much. Go back here. Yeah. I mean, we may not need all of the functions. Let's see. So one thing. That I wanted to see that I think I don't see is a price menu, like where there's options between three prices. I don't know that I would have options between three prices. It may just be two, but I would like to be able to see that.
00:31:50 - Laura L
You know what I'm talking about? Yeah. the three columns. Uh-huh.
00:31:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and this, okay, and that's the background, yes, this is for a single page. And then I like the way there. don't want to use it too much. And here, but it probably go away from most other places. We don't need to add every section. But what we do want, we do want some movement and every section. like that has movement that doesn't need to be there. That's the biggest thing. But the parallax also helps with that.
00:33:09 - Laura L
Maybe for the white white background.
00:33:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like it at the top because it immediately grabs attention and that's what needs to happen when a person first lands on a website is you need to grab their attention and everything that you can do to grab their attention is important. So I do want to have it at the top.
00:33:41 - Laura L
Maybe we can just alternate the wave movement from the white thing or background column.
00:33:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well like here this just is a problem.
00:33:51 - Laura L
Yeah it's an awful one. Maybe what I tried address that I didn't say.
00:34:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a good place to you, because it's above the testimonials, but they can also pop. don't know if that has animation options, so yeah, but it's a really good. It covers everything that I would want it to do. I don't need that. Stuff questions, you've got answers. So like a features block, like comparing packages, that kind of thing or prices, well, really both of them. So anything that you can find that helps, that maybe just really highlights the
00:35:00 - Laura L
the features of a particular offer.
00:35:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so you can compare like this is but most of it will probably be in a in one of those price three column prices because they go here's what you get with this and here's the price right? And then yeah so I think that that's really all that's missing.
00:35:22 - Laura L
Yeah the picture thing.
00:35:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then we need a good checkout page. That's good. Yeah that's good.
00:35:37 - Laura L
Like it's not too busy, they would easily see how what they will be getting from the purchase.
00:35:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah and actually split testing for the most part has shown that the more stuff that's on the page the the less conversions there are. really just want to get that through it.
00:35:56 - Laura L
Yeah it's too overwhelming right?
00:35:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you go to itch. I got in. There's so many things going on. Yep. Yep. Especially on mobile, like, you don't want them to have to scroll too far. You don't want them to read something to take them away from it. Just very clearly support what they already know and let them check out.
00:36:18 - Laura L
Yeah. They might think for a second and then would leave the cart.
00:36:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Exactly. Um, and I do want to get Google Analytics going on it.
00:36:32 - Laura L
Yeah.
00:36:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It didn't say. Okay, so. We've got to have. A different. that's the primary domain. It's not giving an error saying it's not pointing at the right thing, which it was doing before. Total number of veins three. I wonder if it has to be set up all by itself. So here, here, new website completely. Oh yeah, because I think it does. So let's do this. I don't know. I think you just asked our support and we'll find out. Yeah, whatever they need to do. So if that's what they say, then we need to figure out what the what the host records are that we need to put in there, the DNS records, and then if it needs to be We created it as a whole new website here. Then we can do that. This is out of a four. We get rid of this one, because I don't use it for anything. How are you? I don't know about the actual unique visits. Yeah, there's nothing that can be deleted, so. What do you call it? Why do not? I said, manage website. All right, well, ignore it unless you have to do something. Okay, so think if it you're logged in, I will go and get the codes. But if it doesn't work for anything, just if you have, if you can have a little bit of time to let me know, I will watch for it. It just has to be send the message first so that I'm like, okay, I'm ready when you're ready.
00:39:00 - Laura L
Okay, sure.
00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll do that. Okay. All right. Are there other questions?
00:39:05 - Laura L
I think I'm all good. And, um, for the analytics, maybe we could figure that out when we already configured the domain, right?
00:39:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm hmm. Did I invite you to my analytics account?
00:39:19 - Laura L
Oh, not yet.
00:39:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Huh?
00:39:23 - Laura L
I think not yet.
00:39:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, I don't know if I need to create a new one or.
00:39:40 - Laura L
Yeah, for the profit tripers.
00:39:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
want to create a property or an account. I want a property, right? It's not industrial, okay. Web stream. Oh, okay. You I don't want to do all this. I want to be able to add you so that you can do this. let me go back. I don't want to go home and then you can't access management. Oh yeah, I did add you.
00:41:18 - Laura L
Yeah, I think that's for the profit drivers.
00:41:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, this is for it should give you access to everything.
00:41:28 - Laura L
Property access. I'm invited in the account level.
00:41:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I've been a straight up.
00:41:35 - Laura L
Okay.
00:41:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So maybe you take a peek at that and see if it works for you.
00:41:46 - Laura L
Yeah.
00:41:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because this is under all accounts.
00:42:44 - Laura L
Yeah, I'm in, I can also access profit drivers I own.
00:42:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, good. So you should be able to even create properties though. With the access level. Yep. Okay so that's good and then yeah because those are my main goals is to be able to have a good theme and template for sales pages and checkouts and then a good theme and system membership stuff which we have and chose the domain and then get analytics on everything so that we can see what's happening and I want the goal always to be measuring engagement not conversions because Google games the system and they if they know you're measuring for conversion they'll just keep making it more and more expensive yeah is there anything for conversion yeah I've been one of my clients just has been doing this for so long and he's like if I change what the goal is If the goal is not a sale, then his costs drop and it's crazy. But once they know it's the goal, then it's like, oh, well, we're going to change this and you're going to have to work harder and, yeah, so I want the goal to be engagement or specific types of things, but we won't call it sales, even though technically that's what it'll be. We'll just find a different way around it. Yeah, the first step is just getting it on there and checking out what happens, okay, any other questions? I'm good so far, oh, good, yeah, okay, well, same time next week.
00:44:44 - Laura L
All right, yeah, we'll see you next week.
00:44:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and of course, if you have any questions in the meantime, I'm around.
00:44:51 - Laura L
Okay, thank you very much, Tina.
00:44:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're welcome.
00:44:54 - Laura L
I'll talk to you soon. All right, have a great day.
00:44:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good night.
00:44:59 - Laura L
Thank you.

> 00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You muted, homie.
00:00:15 - mark sweet
Okay. here we go. I did the okay to this being recorded.
00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You what?
00:00:21 - mark sweet
I had the okay to being. Oh, which makes sense because you're not going to agree to it. Yeah, you shouldn't be talking.
00:00:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One hundred percent, but did you not have to do that before?
00:00:31 - mark sweet
No. Or not that I noticed anyone.
00:00:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You should have been having to have to do that before every time. Okay. Well, because I don't have the same experience as, you know, people that attend. so I like to know, because at one point. It was, and then maybe it still does is it, but I removed this feature. So it's not supposed to do this. It was emailing. people. I had a time making sure that they were approving of the upcoming call being recorded, but the biggest problem about that was it would take any event I had on my calendar and do that if I invite someone to do it. So like, you know, my schedule with the girls and their dad when they're gone, I shared that with my fiancé. And so he was like, why am I getting asked if this can be recorded? Like, what?
00:01:31 - mark sweet
Anyway, it looks like this quantify is working.
00:01:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That? Okay, so can we get the details, like, defining what's working?
00:01:44 - mark sweet
Yeah, so part of the issue is issue and take student signup on it.
00:01:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so putting it as, sorry, doing take is doing the signup with quantify.
00:01:53 - mark sweet
Signup, okay. Because my side is used to putting it as valiant.
00:02:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:02:02 - mark sweet
Creating a little bit of an issue in that regard. So we're just going back and fixing it, but they've signed at least. At least three cases. And maybe less than a week. Yeah, on 10 grand. So the price works.
00:02:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How, how good are the cases?
00:02:22 - mark sweet
Yeah. mean, they're regular cases or nothing. That's like. Right. There's one more trying to get where it's a broken head, but it's just kind of a race to the bottom in terms of pricing.
00:02:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There were any of them just like terrible and maybe we shouldn't have signed them like any.
00:02:41 - mark sweet
One was where we initially kind of referred it out, but they ended up signing it. It through two different sources, but they got information that we maybe didn't get or wasn't told to me about a preexisting injury.
00:02:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Interesting. Well, but I'm seeing at least at least three, if not for the very least, we have a game to watch for a little while. You know what I mean, even if it's only three three at 10 grand still worse. Yeah, but yes. Yes. The way that I look at things is that there's there's always potentially anomalies. It's not, you know, the thing until it's being done consistently. Oh, right. So, but yeah, for sure it looks like something we've we've there's worth looking at continually until until it's not. That's just the optimistic.
00:03:54 - mark sweet
Right. It's a lot better than the other one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. . Yeah, no, we get it. But you know, the 2022 should be a very small percentage of your cases. It was like 40 something percent.
00:04:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't understand why. I mean, I guess I do, right? They, they all have that on their lead form. Like, is it actually within within the last two years? Like, how many of your clients are actually converting cases like that that are any good?
00:04:27 - mark sweet
None. It technically is a lead, right?
00:04:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's technically exactly right. But it's like, yeah, no. mean, that's why they do it. Because they're we have to do it.
00:04:44 - mark sweet
Right. Because it's just a way for them to pad. And then I see like, it's just, it's the nature of the beast. Not happy about it, but yeah.
00:04:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, Let's see. One second.
00:05:04 - mark sweet
I'm seeing at least three. So that's good.
00:05:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There was numbers. Give me the end of the month. I know it was 85 and since. 83. bad.
00:05:25 - mark sweet
It's kind of a couple of the weekend. So it's like if it was longer, they would have hit 85, but it was already a long week.
00:05:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's a 65.28. So weird. I am searching and I should get the right thing, but I cannot get the right thing. You sent it over the weekend, so I didn't just pop it straight into notes. What day? Let's see. Six more. All right, I'll do it that later. Well, I wanted to look at it though, and then I wanted to see what we want to look at in the report. That's now that I, we have the reports so far that we've asked me to get in the habit of figuring out what do we need to look at each week. Some of those things don't need to be looked at weekly. So that we're taking, so like the price, so we were looking at conversion rate was the last thing that we requested in the report. For leads versus. Retainer signed the month reports. It's under reports or is it under dashboards? That's under dashboards. Management main, right? Okay, so it's not. Oh, it was a different report that we that already existed that we asked that one to be updated, I think. Do you remember Mark?
00:07:19 - mark sweet
I know you're talking about I'm trying remember what we asked to be updated though.
00:07:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just going if I can find the next report. Gather report percentage of cases. Yeah, I did that. Do you remember down because we were all talking about it together and then. Send the requests over through you.
00:07:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Did you. Yes. Would you send it to Stacy.
00:08:01 - mark sweet
I mean, either way, you were saying we had a widget that said, like, sign up great and then with each source.
00:08:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Sign up, great meaning that converting from leads to retainers.
00:08:21 - mark sweet
Correct.
00:08:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's, how so is a widget like the blocks. Okay. Okay.
00:08:41 - mark sweet
For like, instead of matters by zip code, which. Yeah.
00:08:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What did you want to call conversion rate, we can call it.
00:09:01 - mark sweet
I mean, that dude is definitely vulnerable.
00:09:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we need to find.
00:09:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Why would someone be marked as converted yet not have a matter?
00:09:50 - mark sweet
Potentially in a death case or if it's for some other name. Oh, but if you give an example, I can definitely probably. thing into a little deeper.
00:10:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So it's Jill Elizabeth Prophet, P-R-O-F-F-I-T. Yeah, so it's absurdly, and I'm putting the report together.
00:10:13 - mark sweet
like, I don't know what this means. Elizabeth Prophet is absurdly, okay. Because she is a matter.
00:10:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There's no matter. When I search for her by her name or her email, and I pull back the records, I have contacts and takes parties.
00:10:32 - mark sweet
But isn't- It's matter right now.
00:10:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Shouldn't be listed on this sort of synopsis result?
00:10:42 - mark sweet
It is.
00:10:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I have zero matters.
00:10:48 - mark sweet
I don't know what to tell you.
00:10:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, did you search by her name? Did you search by her name?
00:10:59 - mark sweet
I searched- I kept in Joe Elizabeth and there's only like one person in that name.
00:11:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's weird.
00:11:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I just search by just the name and now there is a matter. When I searched by email there was no matter. Okay. Whatever. I'm not going to get into the nuances.
00:11:32 - mark sweet
I don't know why but yeah it's there.
00:11:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I was like well I know converted I thought meant it's done which clearly it doesn't mean but whatever.
00:11:48 - mark sweet
That's that's the role it's just. Sorry, Roberta just means it's no matter.
00:11:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it. So what's the status of the beta-litify functions?
00:12:01 - mark sweet
We're working through it right now. It's Isaac's working on it. Like we had a meeting with it where you signed up for the beta program. So it's in the works, but I think it's like mid June. So I'm like that. It's not ready, but yet. We also Westlaw has their own. So we're playing around with that where it automatically summarizes medical records that you upload. And creates timelines. So we're seeing you that saves a lot of time or is a good use, but it's only 750 bucks per month for six seats, which it's not bad compared to litify who wanted $5 a file. It was doesn't work and they're just suggesting more like that doesn't even make sense.
00:12:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. I just every day I marvel at the greeniness of everything and just.
00:13:00 - mark sweet
want like 1250 for 200 250 files. It's like, it's cheaper for me to outsource it to India. Like, I don't know what to tell you.
00:13:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. To AI and India.
00:13:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's insane. So just absolutely bonkers. Yeah. It's going to be so interesting to see what happens because it's like almost impossible to predict the best investors and market analyzers couldn't predict the things that happened during COVID because it was such a unique time. like, we are still and will be for a while and such a unique time because of the pace of technology. But there are so many companies that are gouging left and right that it's just interesting how long those models will be able to maintained, but also what the potential repercussions are because that's the type of thing that inspires innovation and other people to come and solve problems, but we're in a time period where more people can innovate because they have access to tools and functions that are affordable. Anyway, it's just the it's fascinating. Anyway, all the more reason to be as leveraged as possible in as many places as possible and to be which is the same thing really just a different way is optimized as possible. I don't think you can be as leveraged as possible without being as optimized as possible. anyway, um, yeah, just all the things making sure what we have never have it and what would be really great for the flow of our meetings is to figure out because because we've had to go through a process of figuring out where we could get this data but figuring out what and I did say it before but it's just we got to keep doing it and my brain isn't going to go by itself it's definitely going to be a group effort. What data do we need to look at every single week and then there will so there will always be the portion of the reporting right looking at that and then the the portion of the meeting which is okay now that we see this kind of trending what could we do to improve any of it really like sometimes it's a you know intake obviously we need a script we need to figure out this that or the other thing talking about how and we need to get to this mark how do we improve the incentive program to make sure that we're hitting max retainer max oh you know the work word. Policy limits. Policy limits. And, you know, that we're not going two months without making contact with somebody in an active case, that type of thing. But with the speaking of being leveraged and optimized, these meetings can begin to be, I think that they've always been helpful and productive. But I think that with good reports, they can be, we can use them even more powerfully if we come up with a set of things that we want to look at every week. We always look at the incident by source, by state, which is really good. We're going to start looking at retainer roughly. mean, we didn't break it down fully, but $259,000 for for 29 or 27 walker versus you said about 200,000 for a 25 monkey. That's something and at the very least that needs to be a monthly thing. But what I would love to do is if we could maybe just spend a little time thinking about what are the things that we need to look at every week, what are the things maybe every couple weeks or every month or every quarter that, especially based off of the conversations we've had, that if we look at it with that kind of frequency, we'll be asking ourselves the best questions and therefore taking the best actions for optimizing things. Anybody up for that today or you want to work on that next week?
00:17:48 - mark sweet
Whatever you want to do with it, I'm going to do it in a way, the scripts, Marco, hold from his old firm, Jose is funny from his old firm, so we're getting some more other scripts. try to cobble something together that makes sense for all of us. We're still a little ways away from that, but we definitely get in that.
00:18:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have a target of I want it completed by huh?
00:18:16 - mark sweet
Well June 14. I said June 15, but that's Saturday.
00:18:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm hmm. Okay, good. Um, well off the top of your head. So, um, we see what the heck just happened. I hate when I hit the hotkey that brings up the the source for the webpage. Um, I do it all the time. Okay, so we report. know, obviously it's retainers, stores, I stay. Or has been pulling that data. You should be able to get it and let it. So actually let's just go to let it. So where would I go. To get that the way you've been getting into x by source by state. I have three. I'll go this month.
00:19:27 - mark sweet
You're trying to get what the data that I give you. Yeah. I just had the cases sign this month. In this case I just changed the data last month.
00:19:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that should be something that if you can you look at. What if I or I can change. Okay. Okay. Okay. we want to make sure that everything that we need is in this report.
00:20:00 - mark sweet
Okay, um, any report we could just add it to it on the bottom. It just makes it easy for me to look at it. It's called cases sign this month.
00:20:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so let me go back to. Okay, um, I do want to see it. So, well, whatever, it looks a little bit different in the widget. Where did I go? Why am I there? Oh, yeah, excellent this. All right, touch forward. That is what we mean. Dan, I don't know if you're looking at the screen but so any quick thoughts about what we should be looking at every week. Obviously it takes resource by state. For you, Dan, any thoughts to optimize what we're working on?
00:21:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The other thing that I, in this scenario, would want to, I don't know how we can see if, like, on track, off track, right? So I actually really do this. But so, right, in my business, the meeting that we had like seven through this morning, it's like we look at how many 30, right? So we know, hey, do we average 30 a day last week? Looking backwards probably isn't the best thing here because week too much time. So it's like what should be the average leads per day here? And then what should it be like per vendor, right? So rather than, and this could be a thing, well, there's Josh, but it's like, rather than go, it's sort of like, I don't know if you remember this, but like, we created that early warning system in for us, where we could put it on a site and go, hey, this, we know that this site gets three leave today. When it falls below this threshold, I want you to tell me that because there's potentially something wrong. So here it'd be like, hey, monkey averages 10 leave today, which is pretty much accurate. So it would be, hey, any time that that number is below 10, a you want to be able to pull up a dashboard at any time and look at it and go on track, off track, especially for like an ongoing vendor, like monkey or walker. And That comparative thing where you mark could know on any you know went next Wednesday It's like H FYI. There's looks like monkeys dropped off and Then you can stay on top of it rather than always going backwards always having to go after the fact to go Hey, leave slow down this past month Something like that. I just don't know if it's possible You know what we could totally do that in Lee Pully Yeah Yeah We could actually do that we could probably do that in Lee Floyd Does we Eric and I then they now there's now like this custom code function And we used it to do that we're using it to do the rotator. So we're defining But what gets rotated it 100 to whatever we pick So if we if we counted monkey leads and then reset that every month I bet we could do like well the daily average would be set we would just set that in a field and then we can manipulate that at any time so it only would be checking against something like that that's probably doable great work everyone I ask the questions you get the answers like
00:25:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. That's great. I like that. Anything else that we should be looking at weekly or monthly or quarterly. Off the top of your head.
00:25:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So probably. Like trending average settlement. Right. So how does that look? So that could be that could probably be. In this dashboard, right? you're saying the current. or for the month, right? Whether it's year to date or month to whatever whatever the filter is to date, something like that, maybe, so that you can see. So that's sort of the primary metric, right? If you throw out your ginormous settlements, Mark, I heard you got one. It's a rumor. There's a rumor if you throw those out, right? Yeah, exactly, totally. But even that number gets factored into the average, right? the outliers don't really toss it. The outliers would toss it for the mom.
00:26:38 - mark sweet
don't put that number in let it by because it would just Okay, good.
00:26:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Then we up up the number. All right, perfect. Yeah, so you just want, that's like the another, I'm just trying to think of like, what are these sort of heartbeat issues, right? Or heartbeat metrics. So there's the leads, there's the-
00:27:00 - mark sweet
the revenue then there'd be like versions there's average settlements per month yeah so let's go into that a little bit so how much is almost like a separate dashboard by the way it does the average settlement is one how many matters settle that month yep how many matters close that month because those are not the same things yep how many each team settles because you know hopefully it gets to the point where every case they settle they're going to get new case so they can get a new clause how many drops and how many sub-outs yes and then first-engine policy limit there's no We're tracking that.
00:28:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm hmm. And you're tracking it in live.
00:28:09 - mark sweet
Right. Yes.
00:28:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. It's Josh, right?
00:28:35 - mark sweet
Oh, Steve had mentioned off the cuff. So to get it for whatever it's worth that they've been working with Einstein AI. Which is built into cells. of letify or whatever else and like what if I wants $5 a file to rename it like that's not going to work. But I'm saying AI may be able to do the same thing.
00:28:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Same thing as what.
00:28:58 - mark sweet
Anything I don't know.
00:29:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I. literally don't. It's a team. It can do anything. We all know this.
00:29:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's how that works.
00:29:08 - mark sweet
It's built into Salesforce. Other than that, I don't know.
00:29:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so if the data is there, then it should be able to analyze a computer, give us what we want, the way that we want to look at it, depending on how well it's been programmed.
00:29:29 - mark sweet
Yes.
00:29:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I guess it depends on what this can do here.
00:29:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And what the interface is, because if it's just as clunky, you know, like, if it's a good interface where you basically have a chatbot and you tell it what you want to know, and it can then just go go through the data, find it, and present it to you in the way that you want it, then that's great. If not, you're probably better off sticking with your dashboards.
00:29:59 - mark sweet
Right. I mean, a big thing, too, is it's private problem with open AI as it's open, and obviously what we're dealing with, we can't really have it open.
00:30:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's the open source and Dan can correct me if I'm wrong, is the foundational code that people have access to, but not everything like the API keys and the API integrations, which would be what's this would be using. All of that data is private, I think, Dan.
00:30:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it is. Yeah. You're basically creating your own container.
00:30:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's the repository of code that everything is built on that is open source. That's the that's what's open is the code for the programming, but not what's connected to it through APIs. Guys, does that make sense, Mark does just the worry of forces words. Yeah, I don't, it should be fine, but the more we can keep it in the closed ecosystem, happier I am. Yeah, and I think the privacy rules and everything are going to be more clear and improved.
00:31:15 - mark sweet
How the legal world are 20 plus years behind on anything and everything.
00:31:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I mean for yes, but for the companies that want to work with you. The owners will be on them to create those, those things. So, but regardless, we don't. I love AI. love technology. All the things, right, but that's not the only way optimization. We've already laid when we started Lidify was just everything was a nightmare and it's taken two years to get to anything kind of. Just dependable and clear data, but two years in how many people are still using Lidify and have no idea how to use it well and get good data and optimize and whatever. So, you know, we're making. very good use of what we have. We, in the process, we didn't just, you know, suddenly get our data. We figured out how what we need to be measuring, how we can measure it. It's been a whole long process. We do want to leverage things and see what we can do, but for you, especially with it being all the laws that are involved in privacy and whatnot, better to let somebody else play with it, figure it out, break it, know, you jump in, reverse and revision two or three, something like that. And in the meantime, we'd be optimizing at the foundational level right here, like this, the dashboards and just getting into the little fire reports, making sure that we're segmenting the data, all the managing the team, all these things, like we're doing, we're doing good.
00:32:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay, so, it looks like there's a whole, full trust layer built into this for that. So that like sensitive data is not exposed to the outside world.
00:33:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Instein AI.
00:33:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it looks, it looks, I mean, whether or not this, I mean, I guess it's available since it's salesforce, like, and electrified salesforce. I'll run it by Josh. I mean, it looks interesting. It's got, you build your own prompts in here and. Oh, do I mean, it's definitely saving you the whole idea of coding out to chat GPT, right? It's doing all that for you. And then you have this layer, they call it co-pilot. So the first thing I looked at, I was like, no, but this is a better breakdown. It might be something. Yeah, it's funny. I talked your boy Salco about the AI. And he. He shockingly, he might come as a shock to you, Mark. But he's all over it. The minute I brought it up, and then I explained what it is, and he goes, oh my god, you serious? He's like, it can do that? I go, yes. And he goes, oh, oh, okay. Yeah, that might be interesting and too funny. He's I was wondering what good AI was for. I'm like, well, you might find out.
00:34:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What am I missing?
00:34:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What was the idea? The AI demand writer. So it, in essence, right? It was that I didn't really have any right demands. But he, so I explained it to him because he was like, oh, it could never blah, blah, It would never, he gave it, of course, a very specific example. So he was saying how like, there was a case, I don't know who it was, it was Sam or somebody. And he did a file review for them, and they had like, any of So across those two companies, some weird, you know, medical thing and they missed it and he knew what it was. And so he's like, they missed, they would have missed it. Like, AI would have never caught that. I'm like, AI would have caught that. he's like, what do you mean? I go, if you give it, stop words for lack of better term or alert words, it will lead the whole file and tell you that word's in there. He's like, are you serious? I go, yeah, totally serious. Can you keep updating it? I go, yeah, you would just cause I'm like, you'd give it a first set of words. Like, hey, here are all these words that matter. Make sure that these words are in there. I'm like, and you could get it. And he's like, Oh, well, then the lawyer is going to have to, you know, review the whole file. I don't know. It could, it could spit out. A demand preview for the lawyer that hits all the highlights. they don't have to read the, are you serious? I'm completely serious. But you just, I'm, I'm. You and mark right you guys would have to teach it like it's it's like you're literally teaching it And once it's giving you output that you like it will just continue to do so He was like, oh, okay. That's not how I thought it worked. No, it doesn't just do for you. It does Once you teach it what to do, right? So he was he was like, oh wow, okay, that's a different story. Yeah So now can you use this Einstein thing to do that.
00:36:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's find out All right um Okay, so We've got The information that we want to be looking at each week. So leads conversions Settlements per month. How many manners settled that month? How many matters closed that month? How many each seems settled? Drops and about percentage of policy limits. So I've got a note to Stacy for all these different things that we looked at. So she can talk with you, you guys can work with Josh or she can, whatever. Monthly, let's see, well that already that covers that. Okay, so that's a good start. Isaac is working on that, a little fly, and Tic is working on the script. Ranking leads in clients. So maybe on if we had the Einstein AI, wonder how much better, how much progress we could get on that thing.
00:37:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So we have turned out. You could give it parameters and then it goes and looks at everything you're in Salesforce.
00:37:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That'd be crazy.
00:37:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right? Because then you wouldn't have to. go back update data. Oh man, I wonder if it could do that too. Or if it could spit out list of like, hey, me all the records that are missing this. Oh, interesting. All the records that are, um, whatever, like if you're just like, hey, show me all the records that are missing the state name, all the all the intakes there. And then, but more importantly, like, show me all the show me all the, I mean, basically you could just add prompt reports and but you could probably and then go further into it. Like, just keep giving it prompts and parrying down data that is sitting there running report after report after report. Or it won't do that at all. Right. We'll find out.
00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That would be amazing. mean, there's so much data in there. And if it's connected to Salesforce, Salesforce is already we consider it to be safe. they're integrating through API, you can guarantee Salesforce is protecting their data as much as possible to make sure that what they have is not leaking out through those API access keys. That they're going to spend a ton of money because that's their whole business and livelihood. So if they have the integration, I don't know what else you would want to feel as safe as you can operating in this world, knowing that there's risk at all time that data leads happen. know what I mean?
00:39:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:39:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Freedom of Information Act. All these, it's just a crazy, crazy, the stupid ways people think that they can circumvent living in a digital age. like, if you don't want to be caught as a bad person, don't be a bad person. Anyway, okay, let's see. So we were looking at Cordogiwock. How many new doctors? Now, where are we at in the course? that was Q2. It said, which just ended, right? No.
00:40:25 - mark sweet
And the gene.
00:40:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And the gene. Okay.
00:40:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And the gene. How many doctor referrals? are the top doctors? Profile them? Goal by end of Q2 is 100 incident per month. Attorneys? Okay, those are some of the goals. So we'll just touch on these real quick because these we have a month left. The goal is for attorneys, 1 million and attorney fees, 3 million and settlement fees, total per month, triple per quarter. wants that to be. Oh, I see this settlement. triple of the attorney fees. I'm not sure. I didn't write that clearly enough. Wants this to be 1.2 in attorney fees and 3.5 settlements, 3.5 million in settlements by Q4. How are we doing on that? how would we look at that in a bit? Is that possible?
00:41:23 - mark sweet
No.
00:41:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So that's something that you have inside, and you can just tell us. Is that something that we should be talking about just monthly since it's a quarterly goal? yeah, I don't think weekly would make a question.
00:41:45 - mark sweet
Right now I'm trying to fix a walker issue to keep on our cell phones. And now I'm finding out some of our numbers on our website aren't important, right? So I need to go at Isaac because this is not a problem.
00:42:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like right now or since we get off the call?
00:42:03 - mark sweet
Um, we got 15 minutes, but I'm potentially missing you.
00:42:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So right now pissed off. Okay.
00:42:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ooh. All right. Well, I don't know where that little is, so I need to figure it out. You should go do that.
00:42:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes.
00:42:23 - mark sweet
I'll organize the notes and real quick though before I forget Dan, I saw your email. No, I don't think we have a U.S. and news top law firms, I don't think we can buy that.
00:42:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But if they've found it- No, I just need something that we can put there.
00:42:39 - mark sweet
Okay. American Student Professional is just, they mean as lower of the year or whatever that is.
00:42:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I need some graphics for this to sign up for it.
00:42:51 - mark sweet
Let me know if this looks good and then I'll get on their money.
00:42:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just put them in the hat and send them a picture.
00:43:00 - mark sweet
But yeah, look, lower the year sounds better than U.S. News or whatever.
00:43:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Very nice job. Very nice. Okay. You know, Isaac, I'll organize these notes. Dan will go get some interesting data and see what we can do to.
00:43:19 - mark sweet
Is there a number that can give the walker that technically goes through lead flow, but would connect directly to our intake?
00:43:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like you want a dedicated number for that?
00:43:30 - mark sweet
We can create one. Yeah. Because for whatever reason, I'm calling our 800 number. It's not working.
00:43:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know why.
00:43:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So we can create. Yeah, we can create. And it's just for that.
00:43:43 - mark sweet
So it doesn't need to be an 800 number. Yeah, we can create that.
00:43:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Well, I am then that's another point of like, Hey, this. A way of tracking Walker. Yeah.
00:43:55 - mark sweet
It only takes a couple minutes. Okay. Can you email us me? Because then I can give that to Walker. So then. I can stop this and some calls.
00:44:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:44:07 - mark sweet
Cool. Otherwise, the other thing, Missouri is ready to go. We've got retainer done. We think it comes set up. So I think when the doctor is sending over his first case today.
00:44:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thanks. We have a first case today.
00:44:22 - mark sweet
We should.
00:44:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice. Okay. I mean, I have questions if you're not going or.
00:44:37 - mark sweet
I'm going to wait for Dan to make that phone number while we're doing this, because at least then that solves my problem short term. Okay. Figure out what's going on. Isaac sees not responding to me. So you might be at lunch or something. Yeah. So, okay.
00:44:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's try to figure your questions real quick. Um, just an update on new hires.
00:44:54 - mark sweet
We have Hank, we have Elizabeth. We've got an interview on Wednesday with another intake person potentially.
00:45:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That'll do it. Who's outside. You want, but you want to forward this to six, seven, four, seven, eight, five, four.
00:45:14 - mark sweet
Yep. Okay.
00:45:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, can Liz so far doing okay.
00:45:24 - mark sweet
Yeah, I mean, it's still really, really early.
00:45:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:45:32 - mark sweet
So we started some working through like other cases. So I don't have a lot of updates. Okay. And he's been a little more time with him, but I wanted him to just start getting used to the systems and he's basically just helping more rounds at this point. Right. And working on some of the files.
00:45:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And then the other question. Yeah. We were talking about improving the incentive program to be able to make sure that we're hitting policy limits. Have you made any progress with that?
00:46:14 - mark sweet
No, because I want to see what they're just first before I throw out a number because of my self basically, which is not good.
00:46:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Do you want this number to announce that it's from Walker?
00:46:27 - mark sweet
It's short, we can turn it on too. No, no, because they call and say I'm calling from Walker, so, you know, okay.
00:46:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So when will you have figured that out so that we can get at least 60 days of data and preferably 90 days of data, okay.
00:46:50 - mark sweet
Because again, otherwise, I'm like, okay, they're hitting, let's say, just 80%. And I'm like, okay, if you guys say 90%, you get this extra whatever, but the real number was 87%. And I just looked at a very small sample size, then I end up paying out a bunch more.
00:47:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So when did you start tracking the data?
00:47:09 - mark sweet
This last month.
00:47:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have a date? Thank you.
00:47:35 - mark sweet
May 14.
00:47:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, it's my birthday.
00:47:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do I know that?
00:47:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, it'll just work. I mean, you can call it good work. I'm just setting it up, Mark.
00:47:56 - mark sweet
I don't test yet.
00:47:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, that's a problem. Hey, now. Here I'll call it right now. I mean, it'll be actually would be surprising. Worked that fast. Great. What am I doing? Did you call it? Who's calling?
00:48:11 - mark sweet
What's happening? Two on both music. Sweet lawyer. Thank you. Thanks, Patsy. just want to make sure this works. Okay.
00:48:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)

00:48:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thanks.
00:48:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Thanks. Mail. What was it? Twilio.
00:48:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So August 14th will be 90 days. Then you can look at the data that you can have. August to figure out how you want to plan that September. We execute. Yeah. Yep. Okay. Well, that touches Troni once everything that we're working on if I've gone through my notes, right? Although I'm skimming it pretty quickly. But I think we covered most of the things and got some good traction on what we're working on. So I'm satisfied with the call. Anybody else? Anything else we need to talk about? Add to the list.
00:49:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Did you get Valley and to open the kimono?
00:49:36 - mark sweet
No, but I can.
00:49:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Do it.
00:49:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's what's her name's husband, right?
00:49:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. That's it.
00:50:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Any other questions?
00:50:10 - mark sweet
No.
00:50:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Any song.
00:50:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No.
00:50:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Alrighty. Also, if you guys have any like travel plans that are coming up that would interfere with calls. If we can just because sometimes a little ball of style plan ahead.
00:50:29 - mark sweet
Yeah, I'll touch you guys some stuff.
00:50:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, cool. Okay. Sure that we're making traction and progress every week. Sometimes we could probably do a decent job like this last week with emails and whatnot. But if we know ahead of time, maybe we can plan better. Okay. Go yell at somebody. Have a good day, you guys. Wonderful.

Good to see you Hello.
00:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think I was. How are you?
00:00:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, how are you?
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am. I'm good. So much going on. I'm going to need to see if we can move this call, though, because we're getting into school time, and this is when the kids get in school right now. She's in theater camp, but it's the same thing.
00:00:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
She's getting around the same time. Yeah.
00:00:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there a time on Tuesdays that would work for you?
00:00:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Tuesdays. Yeah, we can do either Tuesday. Uh, or we can do it around like four here.
00:01:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, that it's the four PM ish, like the late afternoon. uh, can really move this thing around. I can probably do it too. Two. Um, well, this was the first one that you said one one. Yeah, I can make that work.
00:01:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:01:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, let me see. Let me just email Patrick real quick. This is you. I just don't want to forget to do this. So I need to take up our time with it, but, um, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, You Okay, let me get that off there. All right, so How's things been going since we spoke last week?
00:02:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Pretty good. I What started out, you know, was a pretty bad month Finished off as a pretty decent month You tree above $100,000 settlements. That was good. was, it felt good. The team was definitely a little bit down by, you know, two weeks ago. Everyone was a little bit exhausted trying to chase down some more settlements. Everyone was kind of stressed out and then the hard work paid off. So everyone felt pretty good about them.
00:03:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Job. How did they feel about the new incentive program?
00:03:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You mean the bonus structure? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think they like it. It's just, you know, we have to get the money in to make it money.
00:03:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
To qualify? Let me go open. And then if I see the report I want, I guess we'll do, oh yeah, Patrick said yes, all right, thank you guys, you guys are awesome. Well, that's going to be, I'm definitely going to need my brain on that one though, because I have to move multiple, and that's really easy for me to mess up, and I don't want you guys to get a billion emails up, oops, from one, sorry, oops. Oh, what am I going, oh yeah, let's apply. Me and browser taps, Lorenz. Alright, we're reaching to the choir. Equals, last month, because we are in August, refresh. Is that the one I want, I might want a different report. If you were going to go check your numbers, what would you do in Linify?
00:05:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I have no idea. I keep track of my own numbers on that spreadsheet. I don't particularly like Lidify. I find it pretty clunky. I can use it for what I needed to do. Anything that I want extra I just do for my own with Excel.
00:05:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, my god is a favorite. It's a case of science. That's not what I want. Probably do you want my dashboard?
00:05:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It means reports.
00:05:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out which one I want. So edit this one real quick. It's not going to be what I Let's see if this one grows last month. Because the reports, I don't want to have to go to multiple reports, so I want to go to one of my dashboards. So, cases, attorney fees, actually, so, your, that's my state, don't want to buy a state, don't want buy team. Cases close my team, I want to add, okay, gross fee by team, that can't be right.
00:06:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I also don't know how often I guess those reports get updated.
00:06:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One other good update as soon as I run it, if I hit refresh, which I did. You didn't just get 92,000 and then attorney fees last month, right?
00:07:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, yeah, it was the attorney fees was pretty bad.
00:07:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I think that can't be right either. So drop out subouts. What's other? I have dropped outside the data is two and then other is 30. Oh, 30 of 32 for two minutes. Hmm. Now we choose to. Let me go back to Mark's notes. So $1 million in and settlements $3 million, okay. So I just look at team brands, well I'm just going to click on you that should do it. Let me show my screen so I'll be looking at the same thing. Sure. Okay, okay. I'm to zoom out of my way here. I'll probably shrink this up a little bit so I can see. Oh, what am I looking at? Time period. It's probably for a month filter last month. I want to look at. Last time through. No. I'm not going to. I'm Save and run. Where's there an error? Filter, the friends. Get rid of that. I already have that. Save and run. That won't give it to me, that's not going to do it. I'll do it for this year. It equals this year. Refresh. It doesn't matter if it's my It's gross to turn me face by team. Okay, now we have just you. Which is not, oh, I think I messed up the report. That's okay, I think I fix it. Ummm. It must just be this, nope, I already clicked on a map to get one of them. I'm just going to discard that and go to a different report, see if this will work. I want to see your stats month over month this year. That's what I'm looking for. Let me do that. me go to, let's see, I don't know what matters. I don't want to turn a fees. Turn a fees this month. a fee by attorney. Oh, it's a mark reports. probably can't see it. Oh, that's everybody. I just overlook you completely. I'll see you. Tyler, Samantha, Patrick, Hank. What's this? That's a time of program. All right. What do you, how do you track your numbers?
00:12:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Uh, with an Excel spreadsheet. Can I see what you've got? Sure. So this is how I track my settlements, my money in, I use, basically use Michelle's reports that are in Google Sheets, this is my settlements, I keep track of how many I get, keep track of the other settlements and I have not every month since last August, so I don't the name.
00:14:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't understand why they're, like, do each of those attorneys, attorneys, have they worked on that case?
00:14:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, no, The name is just for me. I don't keep track of the name of cases that the other attorneys settle. I just keep track of their numbers so that, you know, I can see where I stand.
00:14:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what are, what are the line items then for everyone?
00:14:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So this is right here. This is my own box.
00:14:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:14:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's like the cases I settled last month. This is right here.
00:14:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so then these are these are these numbers represent cases and settlement amounts. Also for them, just not named.
00:14:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I don't, I don't keep track of names for them.
00:14:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, that makes sense. was just. Okay. No labels, okay. So then the totals. And this is settlements, not attorney fees.
00:15:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
This is July settlements and attorney fees. I have the records.
00:15:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So before we get into that, can we just go ahead slowly go through June, go through each month real quick.
00:15:26 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Let me just take a peek at what you've got. So this was June. A lot of cases settled, but not a lot of big ones.
00:15:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And your target for settlements is three million a month, right?
00:15:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
For settlements. Three million, that's the firm goal.
00:15:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Brown goal. Okay. What is your, what is the pod goal?
00:15:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, I've been setting it up 600,000.
00:16:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
not have one for you guys like on a pod level?
00:16:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No. Well, he's never expressed a specific pod goal. When I first started, he said my your break even number is you need to make $110,000 in fees every month. But since then we've hired new people. So I'm sure it's higher than that.
00:16:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and if it's not, it's going to be. Okay, so July, can you share on me July one more time, please? Okay, and May. And April. Can I see Megan? Oh, wow. Okay, April and March. Okay, December. Do you know how to tabulate across worksheets?
00:17:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I've tried playing around with it and I can figure it out.
00:17:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Would you mind sharing this with me? We can work on it and do a tabulation real quick? I know I do that. So share it, Tina at ProfitDrivers Inc.com.
00:17:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
See you now.
00:17:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
At ProfitDrivers Inc. Okay. Send that and then I will open it in ScreenShare and then I'll create a completely new tab so it doesn't mess with anything. We just get that. Wait for it to come. wait where are you asking me to log in a Microsoft?
00:18:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Is that a Microsoft thing?
00:18:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay see if then should be able to do that because that is my Microsoft account. All right cool. It's in there, I'm going to you Windows on my way zoom. Okay, so we're going to create a new one here and we need this to So do we want tools? No, we don't want tools. want that. We just want average name So then we'll just do the same. We'll take these. I'm just actually going to do this for a minute Okay, so we're that big enough to see. Okay, and we're going to uh we actually don't need any of this oh my gosh can i pick the right thing please all right delete these rows and okay i don't want to delete them yet so i actually want this to be really rent and i want it to here i want it to be average and it's going to be of you that um i think you have to do comma oh let's see you Yeah, that should work, right? And then this comma, that comma, that. So you would just change this formula by adding the next sheet every month. And then that should work. So that's your average. And then we're going to drag these, drag this over seriously. So that's your average. Now we can. Oh, sorry. Hopefully I can delete that without messing with the formula. Let me check the numbers though first.
00:22:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
How does Hank's average $900,000?
00:22:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. now that's when you go double check everything. Did Hank even exist back here?
00:22:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No.
00:22:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was marks that used to be marked. That's fine. Yeah. So we got it. That's the other things. We got to make sure it followed the same formula. So A, B, C, D, E, F would have to be the same across the board. Otherwise we just go and do them regularly. And so this is not correct because you will actually, it might be because I might have done it right. Hold on. So this is A, is B, B, B, B, B. Okay, so, so we can't drag this across. We just have to go do it manually. So you should be, yeah, we can't because of Mark, Nick, and Hank. They moved, and Robert even.
00:23:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, Robert.
00:23:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so you could do this, or if you want to spend time real quick, we could go do this manually. took like a whole minute, I think, for each row, then we'll have that data.
00:23:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Are you okay with that? Yeah, that's fine.
00:23:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'd like to see how I stack up. Yep. Okay, so we got to average, and then you go to the cell that you want. And so this is Tyler's. You want to make sure that we're getting that correct, and then we put a comma.
00:23:47 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, they make you the same format every time.
00:23:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So that would be the way to simplify this. If you wanted to create a new one next year or whatever, but this really doesn't take that long. to go through it. You just want to make sure that you're in the correct cell for the correct person to get the right thing. And then after you've chosen the cell, you enter a comma. Oops, there's a space. Don't mess up that syntax. And then put that word belongs and then go to the next one. And we're in Tyler. So Tyler and Samantha are that way.
00:24:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And then now they switch.
00:24:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Yeah. So now we're October and I need Tyler. And then November. Tyler is D. Comma December. Tyler is still D.V. Comma January. He's probably that way all the way through it. We're going to make sure Tyler. make sure I missed February here somehow.
00:24:52 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I don't have anywhere. You missed February.
00:24:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What am I doing? Okay. So April, Tyler, there, comma, May, Tyler, June, and July, May, June, July, and turn, and that should be Tyler. So, now we'll go to Samantha, and okay, so maybe it took two minutes, but still it's good.
00:25:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And that's because we're noticing some issues at the same time.
00:25:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
August is Samantha, I just want to make sure, because this looks a little bit, I guess it's just because it's so full on her line, oops, comma, Samantha, to go over to Samantha's Bee, November, I'm to go Samantha's Bee. Let's see, should I get my comp, okay, December, Sam, September, January, my ADD, and I really have to focus the comma, March, Sam. And there's no February, wait, yet January, March, Thank you, bye. I'm on a call. April, Samantha, we have April, so we're now going to May, comma, June, July. You ready for this? That's our average. Yep. And Patrick's and maybe do you want to get these guys yet?
00:27:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No.
00:27:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're concerned about Sam and Yeah. So now, now let's do a little bit of a difference. So let's get rid of this. And we're going to. Difference between. And. And. And then we'll do Tyler. Tyler. So it's going to be. I'm going to do this. I got to make it the same thing. So it's going to be. Equals. This minus this. And then equals this minus this. So that should be a negative number. This is how much more you are above Tyler on average and Tyler's been around longer than you hasn't he? Yeah. Yeah, Tyler's.
00:28:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, he's been around forever.
00:28:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He was minding her mouth for a minute. I don't do that very often, but I remembered I should. So, I mean, so I want to look at that as a percentage. What percentage of that? So, going to do this equals this. That can't be right. No, so it's it would be this divided by that. And I would just formulate it as a formula, no, not formula, uh, format, format, cool away, whoa, percentage. Yeah, we'll do that. Okay, and this equals that divided by that, and I'm gonna copy and paste special formula normally. So you're 132.6% out of the entire average over since August, so that's that's not quite as bad. She is, she is, she, she doesn't. Now kids, um, she's a workhorse and she is. Yeah. Yeah. Um, it's not a derogatory thing, but, but she's built differently. And that has to be taken to account.
00:30:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Uh, I mean, no, I, and, you know, I'm, I I'm, I'm supposed to be the nice guy, the, you know, the dad with kids, but I'm pretty competitive too. And I, I have been chasing her for the better part of the last year.
00:30:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to, let's, let's, sorry. I did not mean to cut you off. This is my brain.
00:30:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Please continue. Sometimes I get close, but, you know, it seems like she gets, uh, you know, well, you know, sometimes it feels like, you know, she settled, you know, one month, she settled like 30 cases. I'm like, you know, I was pretty happy with settling 23 cases that month. It's, it's just no matter what I do, it seems she's always like a step ahead, you know.
00:31:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, there's other things that we have to look at, but she, she just, I mean, she just, she's exceptional and, uh, but there are other values that get, oh, that's one time I'm on second. Hi. Amazon, her way to get to you. And she's, she's in cosplay, so, um, fun with that. And I'm going to call. That's why she can't to you. Oh, sorry. I just, I can't get it.

But I know he gets Mark's cases so Yeah Yeah, this is definitely not apples to apples June but it's still in the number so and pretty soon it's going to be more apples to apples June july okay so we do that wait minute what went wrong august september comma comma what did i do wrong here it looks correct oh it is correct okay we're not going to worry about nick is litigation right yeah i don't i don't compare that because that's just out of interest it's not how long this hink even had cases like it's a month and a half all right let's just go I didn't get him in there, so there's the formula. We're just going to not do these guys and they don't even need to be in there because of that. Hank, we're going to drive. Oh, here's my little. Hey, I dragged you. Oh, you're just slow. Okay. Average. And let's see. Hank was June and then comma and July. Okay, so we'll just go ahead and put him in here too. And that way we'll just watch that trajectory because you know you don't want them getting in front of you, right?
00:34:53 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, yeah. I've been watching him. I've been keeping track of him. I've been keeping track of the cases that. He's getting to, why is he getting the broken arm one?
00:35:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I mean, that's intake, really, isn't it?
00:35:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I think some of it is intake. I think some of it is also like, it's like a slam dunk. It doesn't make much business sense for Mark to like give it to me, and then I don't miss on it where I can give it to Hank, or who doesn't bonus, and then the fee can go straight to the firm instead of part of it going to my balance.
00:35:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But does Mark, I mean, he doesn't have that much to do with intake, does he? Unless they specifically ask him?
00:35:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, I think he does. I've talked to, a of it event, but who gets the cases as far as thought.
00:36:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was that before, so I want to ask and understand it again. I'm here to say, I'm here to say something. Yes, but that is something I've already been trying to dig into. So it's not necessarily motivated by the call. It's just this call. It's just like reiterated. I really want to understand that. Okay. So then. I love though that you've been tracking your number. July, July, July was above your average.
00:36:36 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, but not money in. So yeah, it was a good month.
00:36:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm going to get a good August as far as fees. Yeah. So let's do that now. What's, let's, I'll stop sharing and you could share your attorney fees with me.
00:36:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, attorney fees, I don't, so I keep track of it through Michelle's reports. So that'll be.
00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But are those not just monthly or something?
00:37:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, it's my. Commission reports. Share this with you. Are you. Share. You see that? Yeah. So this is, it's all dated down here. I don't know. All the fees for this year.
00:37:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, oh, that's going to be a lot of numbers to look at, balanced, cover based balance, do balance, do a sweet lot. Can you break this down for me a little bit?
00:38:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, so really what you're looking at is firm fees right here. That's the money I bring in. This is my commission's right here. And then, so really this is the number that matters as far as like what I think we're talking about.
00:38:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's just for a two week period?
00:38:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, this is, yeah, two week period at the time.
00:38:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. do you have, do So, attorney fees target is what, and is it by Sweet Law or POD?
00:39:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's by Sweet Law.
00:39:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and what is that across the board monthly?
00:39:13 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
1 million, I believe.
00:39:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, that's the 1 million, and then the settlements are 3 million, right, across the firm?
00:39:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:39:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, do you only see your report?
00:39:26 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I can only see my report. I mean, Mark posts them on the week before the end of the month, but he hasn't done it on the last day of the month in a long time, so we don't really know who wins.
00:39:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I don't know if this is correct. So, let me go look at something really quick, dashboards. That's average, I want to total gross attorney fee by team. Let see manners, manners by owner and status active manners by, I don't miss that we want active principal attorneys to kind of figure out which report. Or look at me attorney fees. Let see if that will turn the fees this month. I should be able to customize that by... So, Mark does show you everybody's stuff is just not at the end of the month, right? Yeah, so it's not up to date. Okay, so then I'm going to take that as the sign that it's okay to look at everybody's fees.
00:41:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:41:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you see it, you just don't see. It's just the timing thing. Yeah. So it's not a privacy thing. Okay, so, oops, I almost ended the meeting. Share. I'm going to take over sharing.
00:41:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I'll stop sharing.
00:42:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's okay. I'll share... Get these out of my way again. Oh my gosh. Grab the window. That's not the right thing. Okay. So this is for... This says... yeah, I don't want to change this for... It should be last month. This hot-time custom. Last month. Oh, run. Yeah, save it. That's good. Okay, so the runs... that's not right. Wait, so that's not right. That's right. That's what I'm looking for, that's empty. So that's not right. All right.
00:43:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
that's what I don't like about that if I never does what you think it you want it to do. Yeah.
00:43:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so that's what I need a note to solve. Okay. Let me go back to my notes here. All right, so we talked about scheduling recurring one-on-one meetings for your people.
00:44:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, they're coming up again.
00:44:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And they're monthly, right? So did you just tell them, hey, this is going to be monthly.
00:44:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
This is going to happen every single month now? Yeah, so then it's going to happen every single month. If we need to reschedule, we're it right away kind of thing. It's not like push it out to the next month. And I think we, yeah, that's what we had discussed regarding those. And then also set goals with them. And then set goals with them, follow up with each goal. I take notes of their goals and try to follow up with these goals.
00:44:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So did you create like a call agenda for those things so that you have something just to go through line item by one?
00:45:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I have this. I don't know if that's but it's the same format for everybody. It's not like kind of taking notes as they you know ramble on this. It's a bunch about the same format but I I need to digitize it maybe set it to them in advance too so that they can prepare for the meeting so they're not just like uh uh uh.
00:45:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah I think that that would be best because it helps mentally for that exact reason right? It helps kind of anchor them to what the purpose of the meeting is and you'll probably have a more effective meeting if everybody has the agenda even the agenda is the same thing every time, know, out of sight, out of mind kind of thing. Once you get there, now it's on your mind. But you really want them to be thinking about it ahead of time. So they're not searching for the answers. They've been thinking about it, formulating it, putting into the most articulate way so that you can really comprehend what they're trying to express. And maybe just even so they are able to find the words because sometimes you can have a thought and it's kind of ambiguous in your head. know, not really clear, a little fuzzy. So in just a reminder, and maybe it could be something that you automatically schedule. So let's say it's a calendar invite on Outlook and you have a specific invite that goes out to Viri and inside of the invite, here's the notes, here's the agenda because it's the same every time. And just a reminder in the calendar invite. I think in Outlook you can probably as well, how the reminders go out like in Google, can say day before, hour before, whatever, and have multiple ones. So the reminder would show up and it would show the agenda and just reminder, please review the agenda, be thinking about these questions in advance, and then when you get to the call, ask them, did you review the agenda, did you think about these questions in advance? Yeah, because you want them to be doing their part to make sure that the call is and their meeting is as effective as possible. And that is not a second thought, but it is the priority or an afterthought, that's the word I meant. Okay. So, can you read me your agenda?
00:48:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. I write down everything and so I end up with like no books.
00:48:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which is another reason to digitize it with a really clear title so you can find it. Yeah. Because I'm the same way and I've learned that the more those grow, the less helpful they are.
00:48:41 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yep. Yep. And I don't throw them away either. So, I just, yeah. So, first we start with, you know, basically, how are you doing? Well being kind of questions like how you do feel overwhelmed. Do you have any major issues, any stress points right now that we can address? And then we go through the basically stress points from the client's end and then stress points from the firm end to see if there's anything there that we can help relieve. So, for example, Jessica had from the client end, she said, like, forty percent of her time is being spent resolving PD issues for her Spanish speaking clients. And so we talked about maybe at the intake level, we can take a few extra minutes to kind of reset expectations with clients, explain to them where personal injury attorneys were, of course, going to You know, point in the right directions when it comes to PD stuff, but really our principal concern is their injuries and kind of reset expectations so that on Jessica's end she's not constantly resolving PD issues and On the firm and She says it's PD property damage property damage.
00:50:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry. Yeah, okay.
00:50:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Just make it sir Now the firm end Yeah, she had you know, we talked a little bit about how she's she gets really triggered and upset whenever Mark or Mary are stressed out about the numbers and stuff like that Does it feel sometimes like they're disappointed in us a lot, so She's Just gotta try to reassure her that you know mark is kind of like me We we kind of focus on what needs to be improved and Sometimes we forget to say good job, you know, we forget to Be encouraging that doesn't mean you think any less of first. Okay, I kind of reassured her there and then we moved on to the next The next section which is goals what go I asked her to give me goals for the next 30 days that she wants to accomplish and And, you know, Jessica's very like she's like, I want to do better at this and I want to do better at that Okay, but how are we gonna quantify that? How are you gonna measure that? She's like, well You know, I think overall just and I'm like, no, no, no, you need some numbers that can help you keep track of That and another question that you can ask is what does better look like? Yeah, yeah, and I did And I haven't done right here.
00:51:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What does better look like?
00:51:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So we said some goals about you know, collecting net, you know, cases that are stuck in collecting meds. And then we want to improve policy limit cases. So one of the big issues we have on our team is that Spanish speaking clients, they just want to get done right away. They don't, they don't care about case value, they don't care about treatment, they just want to be done right away. so we're having a hard time getting policy limits on them. And so we set a goal to get, you know, try to push for 10 policy limit cases in the next 30 days. And then one of the things we wanted was more face to face meetings with Mike or her co team member, feels like sometimes they can't redo the same work. So she wants to have, she wants to touch base with them.
00:52:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then at the end,
00:53:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Did you create a plan for that to happen or yeah, I spoke with Mike And then I spoke to the both of them setting that expectation My the issues I did not follow up like a week a week later to make sure it was happening.
00:53:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's my family so But we Did you set a timeline for? Okay, so they scheduled it to make sure it's happening. So you'll follow up on the next call and and that will be your follow up So at the very least it's gonna happen within a month. I think it's reasonable because you gave two adults a You're not micromanaging, right? You gave them an assignment They're accountable for it. So, you know, I think that that's I Don't think you dropped any kind of ball by not checking to me that would be micromanaging Did you grown people do what you said you were going to do? I'm following up, yes, following up a week later, whatever, no, you've already built this. That's the whole point of being very consistent about having these monthly meetings is, you know, unless it's urgent, if there's something urgent and it needs to be addressed because it's a major morale issue or a major financial issue, integrity, that type of thing, then you need to really step in because it's not getting handled and the cost is huge, right? The liability of not addressing it is a big deal. But if it's just overall day-to-day operations, the system following up with it monthly and then two things, one, empowering your team and two, setting very clear accountability. So, okay, you guys said you were going to get this started by next week at the late. It is. That needs to be what happens. And, you know, I'll be following up when we meet next to make sure that it happens. But when you do follow up, you know, you can, there's a couple ways to handle it. If it didn't get done. Um, neither one of them have an excuse. So Jessica asked for it. If Mike doesn't show up, but she doesn't say anything. That's on her. If Mike, um, up and it's not working well, whatever, then then that's just a talk about it, but if they showed up, then then it's good. So, and if Jessica didn't show up and Mike did, then he could say something, know what I mean? So there's no, there's really no reason to be more involved in it other than to say, okay, I hear you. Here's the plan. We're going to make it happen. Let me start the conversation between the two of you so that. that you know, as your reader, that I'm not asking you, I'm telling you, this needs to happen, make it happen, that kind of thing, but from here, your job is to make it happen, not, not mind. I'm not going to call you, did you talk to her, did you do this, did you have your meeting, this is the job, you said that you need this to do your job well, make it happen. If you have issues, report the issues. Otherwise, I assume it's getting done.
00:56:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:56:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, what else did she say?
00:56:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So then we moved to the third section, which I call coaching, any things that I have noticed that you can use a little bit of coaching on. And last month, one of the things I noticed is that well, number one, there's a lot of time spent on non bodily injury issues, like property damage, or just like, you know, listening to your client complain. about her life and things like that so she's you know maybe spending a little bit too too much time on empathy and there's a balance right because you don't want to get subbed out every month because you're too uh too short but at the same time you know I noticed that she was missing a lot of calls because the call that she had taken 45 minutes ago was still happening uh and so kind of thing yeah same thing as John you know uh you know we talking about last time so we talked a little bit about some uh being able to set down Teresa's client even if she has to say hey I'm so sorry I have to go into a meeting right now uh you know I can check in with you in a week to see if we can um if we can get this this thing resolved and then uh the other thing is case value we discussed case value and how we can better communicate with providers to make sure that even if the client doesn't want to do pain management, well maybe we can do a consultation and get an estimate, at least I guess it's more valuable on the case than just the chiropractor and MRI. If we have an estimate for a pain management dog, then there's future that needs to be considered. Even though state farm will likely not consider them, at least they have to, at least that gives us more of an argument. And then we set a date for the next meeting and that's it. That was my first monthly meeting, my first structured monthly meeting with them, so I kept it pretty simple, but if you have any suggestion of things that we can add to that.
00:58:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think it starts small, be consistent, measure the results of the start, and then you make improvements based off of what you've observed. It's entirely too, you can't think of the word, but so that is not the right word, but it's to want to go big and try to over plan and strategize and make the perfect thing, but the simplest solution is often the best solution. So trying to over plan and strategize how that should go, it is not good. Generally, it's going to stay very simple, very small, and the fine tuning comes from the content on the call with the person. What issues get revealed, what things tend to show up fairly consistently for a single person or across the board, and now what they because now we've got a pattern established, good or bad, so whatever the strengths are, you want to turn that up, right? And whatever the issues are, you want to turn that down. So it's more about creating a system for revelation of what do I not know, but what do my assets, my team know, and that's it. having our conversations, reviewing you go for calls with them and just kind of riffing off of what you learned, combine your experience with my experience, know, none of us are perfect at any of this, but, you know, two has better than one kind of thing, as long as it's a good head. mean, some people are just kind of, yeah, think Mark does a good job hiring people. for next. And it's interesting, too, because there's a variety of personalities and skills and ability, and that's one of my favorite things about it, though, is seeing the shifting across teams and how people show up differently on different teams.
01:01:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You know. I think that's why I learned a lot from you last year, is to kind of play to each team members' strength and not try to force them to a square pet into just a round hole.
01:01:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and not playing to their weaknesses per se, but figuring out what you can do sometimes to mitigate the weakness or, I mean, sometimes it's training, but sometimes the issue is personality and brain function, like some people's brains just don't work analytically or in the same kind of systematic way, and some cannot. deal with chaos like Cynthia, like it has to be structured or she's overwhelmed. And that's not a fault. She literally cannot choose to be a different way. So trying to compel her to be a different way, not only is it can't it's not going to be successful, but eventually that would just that could break a person. That's real depression. That's real anxiety.
01:02:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's real health. That's I couldn't see that. When she was on my team, I kind of could see that a little bit. She was just, you know, really getting frustrated with our style and our kind of, you know, like get it done as quickly as possible whenever you can and fit it in between function, like.
01:03:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the way people procedurally do things, those things are innate and they can't be trained. You can corral a little bit, but a small percentage, whereas if you can determine what their strengths are and amplify their strengths, it's pretty easy to amplify strengths when you realize what they are with somebody and give them the resources to do that and that also will increase autonomy. Then you now have an expert who can train some things to other people. There's a whole another way about being able to take advantage of that and not everybody can. There's also a threshold for emotional pain and stress that people can handle. Like Samantha, there's no comparison, I would imagine that Cynthia and Samantha probably could not get along well at all. That could break Samantha or Cynthia. I don't know, I'm guessing, but based off of what I know about certain personality types and performances, that looks like a disaster. Samantha is not wrong for being Samantha and the way that she runs. She's not bad for it. It's just how she, then there are people who can work really, really well in that environment. But Cynthia is not wrong for how she is. She's just Cynthia. So, but we've got people who are willing to show up every day, who are willing to tell the truth and be honest, be an integrity, who care about their jobs. Those things you can't train either. They are either there or they're not. And as large as this world is, there is a shortage of those type of people who will just rather than feel entitled to a paycheck simply because they were given a job. that is a really small percentage of people and that's decreasing. So when we've got people who are willing to work, who are teachable, at least willing to be taught, there's always the mental capacity of how much somebody can be taught. Interestingly, the only person, I've only ever fired two people in my life out of hundreds for being completely unteachable on a mental, intellectual level. One of them's name was Cynthia. She was so sweet and I hated firing her, but I had to fire her because there was nothing I could do to get through to her within the capacity that I was allowed to within the corporation. But that is almost always not ever the thing. What I usually end up having to terminate somebody for is bad attitude, unwillingness to follow procedures, unwind. willingness, not inability, but unwillingness to follow procedures, the way that they treat the customers, not showing up on time, not being reliable. It was almost never a training issue, because if I could figure out what their strengths were, I could figure out how to use them well. And some everybody's got strengths. But if they don't have the foundations of showing up being an integrity, being truthful, being dependable, playing as nicely as they can with others, at least being respectful. Samantha, I think, is super aggressive, but I don't think she's disrespectful. So some people just can't handle aggressive. I'm aggressive. I've learned to tone it down, because I don't want to narrow my pool of people that I can work with. And I've been offensive unintentionally, many, many, many times, sometimes intentionally. Yes, it's the Portuguese in me, but, um, but there's also African and Filipino and all kinds of other angry people. So, wait, I'm not saying that I agree with you. Uh, yeah. Anyway, so, okay, so having these consistent meetings, having a consistent, um, what you call it? Agenda and feedback. Let me go back to your notes. I like, um, hopefully you like that we went through and got the averages so now that you can. Yeah, I think averages is much better because it allows you to compete with yourself. Um, on a more realistic level. So there's two things that you can do. First of all, month to month, did you beat your average and also are you increasing your average because that's really what you want to see. Month to month is difficult because there's just a lot of play in the cases that you get. Yeah. And I like that you're keeping an eye on everybody else. And when you look at the averages, That's the great thing about averages is they it doesn't matter how long somebody has been there. It does because they're not given full case loads. And so you're still not doing apples and until they get full loads, right? But you're able to watch their trajectory and see how they're doing. And if you see somebody new pulling out ahead of you, maybe go like, all right, what are you doing that I'm not doing? What can I learn from you? And tapping into that knowledge base. But also you should be looking for what are you doing good? What's good about you? What are you improving on? Like really, you have to run your own race. Lorenz, because you're too, we are all too unique. We want to be inspired by our teammates, but it shouldn't be about self-deprecating.
01:08:55 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, you know, and I struggle with that because, you know, of my thoughts and school graduated, you know, with Honors in college and, you know, got, you know, always was like at the very top. And I've been sitting in second place to Sam for a year right now. You that's bugging me.
01:09:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, you can look at some things and we can try to break it down what you think it is, but a lot of it is probably going to be how she talks and how she communicates. And so you have to ask yourself what you value most. Do you value most being the top performer in the firm financially? Or do you value being an excellent performer in the firm and being a nice guy that makes people feel good? I'm not saying she doesn't because I don't know that makes your team feel safe. all of these values matter. So you need to decide what your most important values are and you need to rank them. When you evaluate yourself, you need to ask yourself, how did I show up on this value? How did I show up on this one? How did I show up on this one? And then month over month, did I improve on this value? Or did I at least hold steady? And then do that with all the things that matter most to you as a financial success in the company, but also in the way that you show up to your team as a leader, the way that you show up to clients. You need to measure all of the things because you're at the end of the day. First of all, we all have, we slow down, we get older, we slow down a little bit, cognitive function. There's a whole lot of things that go into play there. Having kids is a lot. It's a very difficult job. It is the best job in the world, but you can't always check that stuff at the door. Sometimes you can lose sleep over it. Sometimes what your kids are going through is popping up in your head. You're also married so whatever is going on with your wife You know and the older we get the more health issues come up and even though they're minor But all of these things like there's an accumulation That happens the older we get we care about more people We are involved with more people they take up mental space All of these things have to get taken into account and almost nobody does they're not Does not know that No, nobody does really I I'm just wondering because it seems sometimes like You know, I I want to have those values those non quantifiable values these talk about sometimes it feels like The only values that really matter at the end are the quantifiable the The You need to go have a great conversation then Lorenz and you need to say, I want to know these things. I want to know what matters. First of all, do I need to worry about losing my job and at what point would I need to worry about losing my job? And then you need to ask them what do you value and can you rank what those values are for me so that I understand it and how do you feel I show up in those values and ask them. I would like to know about the financial one. I know what those values are but I want to know are you happy with me? Are you happy with my pace? Like I know you think I can do better because I hear that all the time but what I want to know is what do you value about me and do you feel that my value is enough that if I keep going the way that I am and I'm trying to do the best I can do I need to worry about my job. If that's a concern that you have which seems that you do. Enough comes up. that I come from there's some like professional trauma that comes into it to where I know I've worked in places that you know if you have kids you're always kind of on the shopping block at then you're you're on the and no one says it but I can promise you that that's not what you have with Mark okay I promise you that I would not make a statement I wasn't confident in and it's the opposite he is very tender hearted towards families and kids and has a huge responsibility in taking care of his people as much as possible sweet lot is about the people to him I understand yeah I think that's why I'm very cautious in you know doubting him because honestly he
01:14:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
has given me no reason to to doubt him if I'm very if I'm being objective. And all of myself down actually come from my past experiences at other firms.
01:14:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good to know. But you know what it markers the kind of person I think you can have that conversation with and you can blame it on me. I'm just like I'm just talking to Tina and these things are coming out and I'm realizing I've got these fears and I think they're holding me back and like like you can tell them you want to do the best that you can you can tell them what you think your weaknesses are and what you're working on you can tell them that you think your teammates some call control training which I just googled and I think that we could probably find some training even if it's through video courses. My first life was in the corporate world and a call center and tech support and when you get old people who don't know how to use a computer now this was 28 years ago so computers back then nobody plenty of friends. Everybody would be like, they thought that CD holder was a coffee cup holder. I'm not kidding you. They would say their computer doesn't work. It's not even plugged in. I'm not kidding you. That was a regular thing. So, and they were lonely and they're like, there's somebody I can talk to. No, you can't because I've got, I've got metrics I have to meet or we don't get paid. So, but if I treat you badly, then I get docked and then we lose our business because they're also measuring that. So, I had to figure out where the safe place was where I could get them out the door, they're happy about it even though they didn't get the socializing they wanted and they didn't like being told what to do, especially by a little girl, especially the men. Didn't all like that at all. It was just, you know, almost 30 years ago. So, a lot has changed since then, but that was a whole different world. Anyway, your team call control for sure could learn that. I think everybody at Sweet Law intake, especially, needs call control skills. I've been talking about this with Mark. I really just need to go find the solution for him and get people on there and training, because I think that I haven't even listened to the calls. But from what I've heard, it's got to be there's way too much allowed to happen. And there is a way to finesse a conversation so that it's handled efficiently without hurting feelings. And it still feels like care. that is a skill, and it is trainable. Everybody won't learn it as well. Anyway, so, Pondre, think about it. But if you're not sure who you're working for, I would recommend that you figure that out.
01:16:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I think I'm getting an idea. Honestly, I share those, I share this with you kind of in confidence, but also because that's You know, that's some of the feedback I'm getting from the CMs that have been here a little longer kind of, you know, they kind of get the same feeling like that, you know, they like Mark and they feel like, you know, the firms are whole values then but they It's so inscrutable sometimes, it's hard to say, it's hard to see if he thinks he's doing good job or not. And you know, I think, you know, I will have that conversation with them probably later this month.
01:17:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll give you one more perspective. He pays me $1,000 an hour to have these conversations with you and I have no oversight whatsoever.
01:17:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, wow. Do you know anybody else that would be up for you? What's that? We should probably end this call soon we're over.
01:17:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I, it's not hourly. It's monthly. This is, this is my time. So it's me.
01:17:59 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Honestly, that that did. a lot of my confidence when we set up these calls because I know how much he values you and so if I was I know that if I was on the shopping block he wouldn't bother.
01:18:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No 100% would not because there are other people that not really on the shopping block but he would not invest in. So that's also between us. Um but do you know anybody else have you ever worked with anybody else that would give you that kind of training and that kind of time?
01:18:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No.
01:18:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I understand that it's what you hear is get this stuff done. But um I don't know if you were listening.
01:18:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
By the way sorry for interrupting but I don't kind of the same one of the issues that I'm kind of the same as Mark is I also think about what's next. I never take the time to smell the roses.
01:19:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you really care about your people, don't you? Yeah. And you're not looking for ways to fire than you're looking for, how do I help them, right?
01:19:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Exactly, yeah.
01:19:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. I think that you two are, you have some similarities. There's a scripture though that says, shall know them by their fruits. How many people do you see getting fired at Sweet Law?
01:19:25 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I think I've seen in two years, I've seen one. And I've seen people leave, but getting straight up fired in one thing, because she never showed up, essentially.
01:19:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's probably pretty unique, isn't it? Yeah. How many people do you see getting suspended, terminated, like, fully berated in front of everybody? I've never seen her. And how many times have you heard somebody like complain is just about getting. two down getting threatened with our job and just high levels of stress over it. Let me just give you one more example. Cynthia is still there. I know Mark has a hard time with her too, but he still keeps her and she's easier to replace than than an attorney. So I don't tell you a lot right now. When I say you shall know them by their fruits, you can say all that you want to do and you can look like a prickly pear, but if you're soft on the inside, you know, that's what kind of fruit that we have is that at the end of the day, the people are really what matter most. The business has to be profitable for the sake of the people. What good is it to you? Sweet Law isn't profitable. You don't have a job anymore. So he has to push that. But but also tell you one more thing and then I do need to wrap up is that when we start reported this. It was supposed to be every other week. And it was mostly about marketing business building. And it was with, it was my client that Mark also works with. They were working together and he says, I need Tina in here because she does something I don't want to do, I don't do, but I need you to have her helping you. And so we got on a call and then the second week, Mark said, how do I get this weekly and how do I focus on leadership? I've never had anybody before that say, I need to work on my leadership. Now we did that, but nobody just asked and they didn't ask right out of the gate because I had asked him some questions and he and his self reflection was like, I need to be a better leader. And so he's been working on it. So I will tell you, you have a very unique person that you're working with. And if you do better because you just want to do better and make them happy but not because they're scared. That energy is different. How we operate from fear is very different than how we operate from confidence, even if we have the same exact goal. So ponder that a little bit and maybe get to know what we work for.
01:22:13 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's funny because I just said that's my 11 year old last night. It was just that conversation.
01:22:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And this is why we all need people that we can talk to you because we know the things but sometimes we feel to recognize where we're not employing.
01:22:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's me.
01:22:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's me. It's all of us, really. It's all of us. We have to have those people. So but when you're at the top in your area and there's really not a lot of oversight from Mark. So really you're top dog and there's not a lot of people to counsel with but also you know don't necessarily want to tell your boss everything that you're worried about, especially with previous trauma. In the standard corporate world, that's just not that's just not good for business. It's not a safe thing to do. But what I'm expressing to you is that you do have a very different situation. situation here, and I would suggest that you explore it, and then ask for advice, use mark, but I think if we keep having these conversations, just inspecting how you're doing things and making these little changes, the amazing compounding effect over time you look back and you go, wow, we're all different. And it's just because we're inspecting it honestly and bull normally every week and then making some decisions based off of that and it's pretty powerful.
01:23:35 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I appreciate you showing up and, you know, not being like, oh, Lorenz, you know, you're just too nice of a guy or he's not getting it or, you know, I appreciate you. I know I take some repetition, you know, I know I can be a little stubborn in my ways because I'm probably a lot better than you think you are.
01:23:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I promise you, it does mean no good to tell people things like that and to lie. I get nothing. out of it except for more work. If I were to compliment you falsely, I'd just mean my job harder. You're better than you think you are. Whatever that past trauma is, whether it's in the workplace or anywhere else, I know. But generally the best people are the ones that are the hardest on themselves and it's usually the jerks that think that they're the most amazing people in the world. It's so weird, but that's the truth. So the reason you can see your flaws so much is because you're looking for them and because you're trying to improve them, whereas an egomaniac and an narcissist is not looking for their flaws, they're looking for how awesome they are and they're working on nothing. So take that into account too. There's a balance for everything, but what I want you to make sure that you're doing every day is, what did I do good today? What was good? What did I move forward or what did I do even though it was hard? What did I do to Help somebody else be better. What did I hold myself back from when I just really want to You know take into account all the things that you did good if it was it was You know spouse related if it was parenting related if it was health related because we can't do all things all the time So you have to take all the things into account Because what you might do is go. Yeah, I dropped a ball at work hard for today But if you had a super dad day, I don't really care what you did at work that day I really don't because it all comes out in the wash But Lorenz is the one at the center of it. You're the nucleus of that world and so you have to count all the winds and You can't just go. I did all these things wrong. I'm not saying don't take stock of the things that should have been better I'm just saying count all the good things every day You'll start to feel better about yourself and not in an egotistical way You'll just recognize your power and you'll be able to let your weakness says have less power over you recognize that they're just human and tomorrow will be a little bit less weak and a little bit more strong.
01:26:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, I think that's good advice. think that's what I've been working on this year is trying to be lose my confidence less easily when something bad happens when trying to.
01:26:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so this is, I know you're saying it's the last thing, but this is where your tracking is going to help you. Okay, so looking at all of your stats and having them in a spreadsheet where you can look at your monthly's, but then your average is, and you're just looking for incremental improvements. So when you go have a bad month, you go back and look at your average and go, but it only knocks my average down a little bit. So maybe the disparity between the two months are super huge. The average is going to come out and so you're going to go, you know what, bad month, shake it off, month we're on fire because we're due for it.
01:26:55 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's how it's going to work. I see. Now that's good. I'm glad you. but the formula's in there. going keep them going for the, you know, every month now.
01:27:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so and that we want to track attorney fees too. So I'm going to see if there's an easy way to do that through the reporting and if not, we're going to create a spreadsheet and take Michelle's stuff and just start tracking that and whatever reports Mark gives you and we'll make our own spreadsheet and tracker because that is actually going to help you too because you'll keep it in a track of that anyways and that's good. All right, well you have a great amazing week and I will talk to you

Okay.
00:00:10 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
I just literally just finished. Just now.
00:00:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh. Can you get some water?
00:00:22 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)

All right. Hold on. me fix my zoom.
00:00:35 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
I was like, I'm pretty sure it's too 30. I was like, look at my, like did I missed it?
00:00:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. No, I just was on a call and I had to jump over.
00:00:45 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
It was an early day for me.
00:00:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What time did you start?
00:00:52 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Um, I, I start, I was there at six, 15. I was early today, 6-15, and because I have an 8 o'clock to 12, it's like new in the hospital like new doctors and these orientations, even though I'm not an employee, I have to attend. So I rounded first, and then so I can go home and finish my telemedicine. So I'm calling them while I'm driving, and it worked out, so that's good. I finish all the time.
00:01:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how long have you been, have you kept up on it? It's been at least a week, right?
00:01:46 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, I think I'm kind of, because the hospital is at 21, so right now I have, I think I have I just want to tell you. exactly the number of patients I have. I have about 24, 26 telemedicine. So I kind of gauge between charting and calling it. It's the same. It's pretty much the same. The hospital calls it's about two to three hours for 20 patients with phone calls. mean with conversation and charting. So it's about that I can like, you know, because I'm like trying to gauge how fast, how, you know, the how fast I'm like, I know I'm getting faster. So that's kind of like how I look at it. But I pre chart meaning like the hospital is easy because it's follow-ups. So I kind of pre-chart, kind of populate the chart and I just have like two, three liners I have to update and obviously the orders I have to update if need be but majority are quick follow-ups so I it kind of even out new patients are always takes a longer time but it kind of evens down so because I was quick I was I started at 6 15 then I finished by 7 it's actually just an hour and then I finished my charting like 750 so it's like about yeah it's about two hours on 20 patients so which is a good yeah yeah so I but I don't know if I heard the answer when I was asking was how many days consecutively since class is it like over to we
00:04:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's thinking around two weeks.
00:04:03 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Yeah Yeah, I just you know like yesterday. I was actually kind of I'm feeling tired because dr. E. have a like I texted you I have a I'm training someone So, you know, I'm trying my best to make sure that that person is Learning something but so I'm just letting her do on her own and at the same time The teaching is just takes a little bit more time But I'm conscious is that the one that I'm seeing I chart I finish the charting So the one that she saw she just saw three people which takes her, you know, she's new so it takes her for three people about an hour or so So I finish that When I got home because I wanted to just see, you know, what she's writing because she's writing on mine And so I need to give her feedback and stuff, so, and Dr. E was like, he had to run to the OR so he had me cease some of these patients, so, but I feel tired and he's like, you don't need to go to the hospital, you can just call. said, well, my patients will miss me. It's like this is the owner show the patient see me every day and I'm seeing them during the hospital. I just want to make sure that, you know, they can there's like face to face. I could have said no, but, but I guess what I'm trying to say is I could have just gone home. It just doesn't feel right.
00:05:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, after the fact, do you feel like you should have gone home or do you feel like you did the thing that you wanted to do?
00:05:51 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
I think, I think I was a, it's, you know, it's the routine that I did. Again, I was a little bit hungover with this man. occasion right here Which I didn't take that much last night.
00:06:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's why cuz I said I have to wake up early I said codeine.
00:06:08 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, I need to I need to wake up early. So I I woke up I left around five. It's like 20 minutes. It's like five forty five So again, if I really really want to I will be able to do it, but it feels good on just finishing The tasks last night and I wanted to finish the charting in the hospital But I'm feeling the tiredness. I thought I would rather drive drive 30 minutes and then chart at home So I finished So It's kind of like adjusting. I'm so adjusting. I'm trying not to be so hard on myself Like I need to like finish to like but at the same time just the time management and yeah but i think it's overall good because after you i have facial but i'm trying to you know the carousel yeah so i'm talking about facial and then tomorrow i need to start early again because my mom's have a appointment i need to help her and what else i'm doing i have eyelash appointment tomorrow so i guess what i'm trying to do is like if i really start early like what i'm doing right today i have a lot of time in the afternoon good i i think that that's great um there will be times when you end up sleeping in late or get a little bit um you know off-track but as long as you remember what things that you do give you the most energy and give you ultimately the most freedom so it doesn't feel like
00:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
lot of freedom when you get up early in the morning and you're doing that work. But when you have the whole rest of the day free without stress, without anything like on top of your shoulders going like I've got to do this, that's pretty liberating. And to also know that you showed up really well for your patients, you showed up really well for Dr. E for the clinic for the hospital to know that didn't just show up, but you completed the task and well. you took great care of the patients and you made the rest of the work that has to be done. Those charts are important for everybody else's take care of them.
00:08:37 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
like that's got to feel so good that you not just did the job, but you how do I say this? Like I judge myself harshly at times like it's very hard for me to really say oh good job. So I even though I feel like oh, I did a good job. I will kind of rate myself mid like I'm not It's very hard for me to come like myself although, you know again, you know The validation from patients it's good the validation from other providers like I will read their charts like pain With good pain control, you know, that's what they were and appreciate, you know pain management So, you know things like that. It validates, but I Need to have it more from myself. I think that's the That's the key and I was telling mark. Yes, and he's traveling I was telling him that I need to really have This bread and butter under control. So I have more energy to do things because I feel like month I think Monday Tuesday on the clinic. That's all I have Wednesday Thursday Friday I don't have any because initially we talked we talked about removing the true state clinic to give more time, but also actually having that clinic patients is where I get patients as well for the KIKI. So like for example, I see a patient of ours that got into an accident, and then actually I can refer the attorneys I'm working with. Or Dr. E doesn't, he's okay with whatever I do with this patient. So that's actually good thing. I don't know if I told you this, but I got two patients referred out because of the clinic patients I saw, the regular patients. So because they're from insurance, for example, they're up them, we don't necessarily gain a lot because it's confusing for the patients to receive treatment through lean. T.I. versus the insurance. So even though I don't make good money from it, but it's kind of solidifying the relationship with the other lawyers. So that's what I'm trying to get out of them.
00:11:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I heard something really, really interesting today and that is the tactic of the number one sales person, car salesman in the world. And the thing was that he didn't work so normally going to car sales live and sales person asked themselves, what can I do to make sure that they walk away with a car today? His goal was, what do I do to make sure that when they're looking for a car, they come to me and they think of me and they think, okay, I know I'm going to buy a car so you establishing these relationships with the with the attorneys, but also with your patients. To me, that kind of seems similar to that strategy is, you know, you just got great relationships with them. So when the time comes that they need something that you offer, PI help, then you're the one that they want to go to, does that make sense?
00:12:17 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Right. And I have to get over like, feeling shy, like, oh, I'm taking up their time. I'm getting over that hump because it's, I'm not a, you know, the kind of person, it's just not who I am. I'm not two sales person, but I can definitely develop that. Like I message Tyler, the, the case manager who I'm waiting for the approval for a procedure. And that was last week before the Thanksgiving or two weeks ago. And then I greeted her with half a Thanksgiving and then she responded back Monday, but I didn't mention about the procedure because I tell Mark, I know she's just coming back to vacationing. I'm trying to not be too pushy. That was Monday. And she didn't respond in. It's about, it's about holiday. She said, thank you. Hope your family have a happy holiday. And then I said, yours, yours as well. And then I said, I eat a lot. And then that's it. She didn't respond. And then I didn't ask about the case. So that's two days now. So now I messaged her. I said, let me know when I can call to just get an update. That's it. Because we're leaving next week. And I wanted to make sure that that patient is taken care of. I know that it's holidays, everyone is kind of getting, you know, busy. There's also one thing that I wanted to share with and it's the same number. right?
00:14:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, same phone number.
00:14:02 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Tina, um, like I can't find you.
00:14:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know. Let me see.
00:14:11 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
I just wanted to share you what, well, I was on the orientation. My mind is, is about, you know, making, doing it for my business. I was paying attention. Okay. Okay, it's a non-request accept. Okay. I wanted to share with you that this is what Mark shared with me. How do I? And then while I was doing the, um, while I was on the orientation, I did this and I wanted to share with you, um, sorry. Okay. He sent me this one. think he was in, um, I forgot which event he was on. So I guess this is the pain management or the pedic. I don't know where he found this if this isn't a card or in a paper, but it's like an ad. It's like an ad, right? So I was looking at that, I this is actually very good. So I try to kind of copy it for us, what, how I can do it. And this is just my handwriting. This is like rough jobs because I was not bored, but I was like, my mind is in this. Well, on the orientation, I'm trying to see my handwriting.
00:15:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's not worse than mine, I promise.
00:15:39 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
So I'm trying to kind of get inspiration from that. I don't know how I can do this, but I have a lot of ideas. I'm going to start reaching out and have to do the lunch and learn.
00:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's first of all, to grab attention, second of all, to keep attention and then to be memorable. So, those things make an impact on how effective any kind of marketing campaign is, like even this, right? but all of these things, one of my favorite words is compounding. And every experience that you have, everything that you do, has a compounding effect on your confidence, has a compounding effect on your network, like the relationships that you have, they grow, they expand. You know, like, I'm sure you've seen the visual of what it's like when we make a new neural connection, which I love that. Every time we learn something new, like, we've got these little synapses and these dendrites reaching out to another one and like, linking up. I'm like, that's what happens when we, when you take care of a patient, or maybe the patient's there and their husband's there. And, you know, like we're making this network and it's powerful, but it doesn't really degrade if we continue to nurture it and maintain it. And then the more that you get comfortable in performing these things and the more people that you talk to about PI specifically. So you've been doing pain management for a long time, but PI and there's a lot of nuance to that and there's a lot of things that you had to learn. So first wrapping your head around learning it and then your ability to communicate it and teach people, this is what happens, this is what you're going to experience, this is what you need to do. And then, you know, there's the conversation that you have with the attorneys, there's a conversation about Dr. E, there's a conversation that you have with your patients. So every type of thing that you're doing, you'll get better at it. And when you realize, because you are very smart, Chona, I don't play Kate, I don't, I don't paint her eyes. I wouldn't tell you something, be like, she's my client.
00:19:12 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
I'm gonna make her feel good. it wouldn't be useful to you.
00:19:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you, you are very smart. And you, to me, you have an innovator's mind. If you see that something should be improved and could be improved, you're looking for a way to do that, and then you're doing it. And so what that also tells me is that you're above average anywhere that you show up. So you're going to be above average, even among attorneys, among doctors, among nurse practitioners, because most brains don't work like that. Most brains are not so problem-solving and action-oriented. You know that, you probably don't give yourself the credit for it. But if you ask yourself, do most people operate that way? What would you say? Yes, right? Most people are box tickers like, what do I need to get done by? And you're like, wait, wait, wait, this could be better. Let's just make it better. So you have a lot of value to bring anywhere you go in life. Okay. Because of that, being able to be comfortable talking about these things and talking about it with people would be good for you, but it's also a good service to them. Because of the way that your brain works. So it makes you a good leader because you're a doer, but also because you comprehend it, and then you comprehend the way to improve it. So keep those things in mind. And if you're going to keep doubting yourself, don't worry because I'm just going to keep telling you how awesome you are.
00:20:51 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, I think it's really interesting how I'm still like this, even though, like you said, I... did. I held leadership positions. I, you know, I don't know why I'm still like this. It's like, um, like, um, what's that syndrome? Yeah, imposter syndrome.
00:21:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:21:17 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
I, I, you know, I've talked like with doing my doctors and I talked whatever on seminars, like, I still don't comfortable, but, but when I become comfortable and it comes the way time, like you said, like the more compounding, the more I do it, the more I get comfortable. I'm sure I will, I will get there. It's just out of time.
00:21:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I think that God also gives us humility. And sometimes we think of that as imposter syndrome, but maybe it's just a little bit of humility, knowing, um, staying teachable and remembering that there's already somebody better and smarter than us, but that doesn't negate our about you. And that's the thing to keep in mind. If you're smarter than average, if you have something to contribute that the average person doesn't know, it doesn't matter if you're not the best or the most polished or the best grammatically or in written word or anything like that. The question is, do you have something of value to contribute? So, rather than try to quantify or qualify what that value is or compare to other people who you might think is more polished or whatever, just ask yourself, do I have value to bring? And focus on the fact that's why I like celebrating wins, what the feedback have been from you from not just your patients, but also from Docs or E that you've helped them so much. I think maybe even from Cheryl feeling like a little bit lighter since you're around and pay attention to that and Unless something holds true, like unless somebody tells you something and you look at that and go, yeah, I need to work on that, then let any other negative voices go because they rob you of energy and we need energy to accomplish every single thing that we have to do. So if something is a thief of your energy, it's a parasite and you need to treat it like that. We inoculate ourselves against parasites. We treat ourselves against parasites, right? We don't just let them live and ignore them because we know what happened and what they take from us if we let them stay, right? So you need to think about those negative thoughts in that way that they are parasites that will rob you of vitality, vital energy, vital confidence, you know, and that keeps you from actually doing the thing that you're doing well.
00:23:59 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Right now. I think my schedule is pretty. I had a good grasp on my schedule and I really need a routine and keep on going. Mondays and Tuesdays are the busiest because I have clinic, telemedicine, and then hospital.
00:24:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:24:17 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Wednesday, Thursday, I just have hospitals and telemedicine. So those three days I can do a lot on meeting people or that's something I need to work on is the Washington thing. Once I've started, those three days would be the ones. Monday, Thursday, Friday, would be the one that I can incorporate the telemedicine in Washington. I think we were talking on the phone the other day and he's like, I think he kind of and he said, I thought that the the referrals to you would be more so you know you know obviously Mark is very positive finger like he he may have over tell this to me so um but he did tell me that you I can just open a door you just have to follow up with them you know like for example that's the thing I want to say about where we're at right now is that you're just on the precipice so again we're only 90 days in we're 90 days in yeah big big big deal right there okay the first 90 days is just head wrapping it really is all it is you already got into flow which would be normally the next 90 days you hit that before we even got to the 90 day mark so flow is you've got a good rhythm and a schedule and you understand things and now now
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
how you're making the space for actually being able to receive new stuff. you're not only on schedule, you're kind of ahead of schedule. So, and this is something I constantly have to remind Mark of is like, slow down, everything's actually on track. Don't stress, don't get negative, don't, don't anything. Like it's all the way it's supposed to be. So for sure, he would have mentally held back until you had a flow that he could observe, not just for the sake of the reputation of the business, but also just not to cross you with pressure and overwhelm, but the reputation of the business, 100% matters. So if you weren't ready for it, it would have been sabotaging and poor business to try to get things going quickly. So your preparation and you're getting in flow coincided with you being very sick and the holidays.
00:26:55 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Right.
00:26:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you have to take that into account.
00:27:00 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
It it feel and I'm on antibiotics again, but I do feel I feel that I'm there's something brewing in there my x-rays negative, but like I think after the COVID after the first COVID I had in 2020 where I don't know if I told this where I who I got it from pass away, which is the mom of my best friend.
00:27:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tell me that part.
00:27:24 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
That is before the vaccine.
00:27:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I got it. I got the first one.
00:27:30 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
After that, I've been I get sick very easy.
00:27:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
me too. It wrecked me and if you want to, if you want to. So there's a company called Silver Fern Brand and I love them. I've learned so much from them, but what I ended up doing was basically first of all parasites, lots of parasites and I learned how to recognize what they look like. Yay for stool. Anyway, you're video. Um, but I recognize the symptoms and I, um, the impact also my hormones tanked at the same time, you know, I was paring on a puzzle and my first child moved out all of that coalesced at the same time as COVID. So that was rough. But, um, the hormone therapy has been a lot, but it didn't really work well until I fixed my gut health and I didn't know about the gut brain connection. So anyway, but they, it was, um, basically silver and immunoglobulins have done the biggest thing with a very specific type of probiotic that has high survivability and high diversity, so that I've got more diversity in my microbiome. And there is a guy on Instagram called Kieran Biome that I love to listen to. So he's a, don't know what kind of scientist I can't think of what is it called?
00:28:52 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
He H.
00:28:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm cheering. Kieran Biome, K-I-R-A and BIOME.
00:29:04 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Okay, so follow him.
00:29:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then like a biologist. Yes, but he's so good at explaining.
00:29:14 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Because you know, some people take forever to get to the point so that you know, he's so good at getting there so fast.
00:29:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then Silver Fern Brand and makes some amazing products. But the guy, I mean, they're also very good at teaching things very quickly about why certain things happen. Silver Fern. F-E-R-N.
00:29:40 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Friend.-E-R-N. I'll say the other thing, I found it now.
00:29:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah.
00:29:44 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Okay.
00:29:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
they're also very great at education and they make excellent products. it took several months. of course, when you're trying to change your digestive system that much,
00:30:00 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
It's uncomfortable.
00:30:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's sad. Yeah, it's very, very unpleasant, but it was worth it. But I'm also, I take a scientific approach to everything. I isolate my variables. literally eat the same food all the time. I introduce one new thing because I really want to feel great, energized all the time.
00:30:20 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
want to age well, and my genetics are not conducive to that.
00:30:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but after COVID, I have like a lump of my throat for a year and a half. I was in constant pain. I couldn't eat hardly anything. I'm like a diet. There were very few things that I could eat without just being in total pain. I don't have to tell. So, I didn't really have any other options. It was that or just like, I don't know, I, it was terrible. Like I don't, it was terrible. And the brain fog, I wasn't able to think well, the depression on top.
00:31:00 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
that and now I can eat almost anything.
00:31:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am allergic to dairy but I can still eat it and I just have mild inflammation. Now if I eat it and eat it and eat it and eat it, then I have, know, a lot of inflammation because it is a real, you know, allergic response. I wasn't able to eat garlic. I wasn't able to eat onions. I wasn't able to eat anything. Like I would just eat it. Everything was so bland. It was so terrible. I couldn't even, I couldn't even eat fruits and vegetables, Shona.
00:31:33 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Oh, that was bad. Yeah.
00:31:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, but it didn't happen until after first round of COVID, which I got in the winter of 2019 to 2020 because it was actually already in Oregon at the time, but we didn't know what it was yet. But I was sick. Almost died. Like it was, it was terrible. That was, yeah. So, so I get it.
00:31:55 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Anyway, I feel like after that, I got, it's what we call in medic, it's like COVID long. is what we get the term that they now use and I feel like I got that it's like it's like when you get TD that you get scaring in your lung and that's I think that's what the COVID does to me because I get I told you about the florona early this year oh yeah oh yeah and then I went to the urgent care this weekend finally this mark has been like you know drilling me on it he's like you're not gonna ruin Japan or anything. I was just like worried about me and I said it's fine cuff lingers for eight weeks even after any viral or whatever but anyway so I'm just taking the meds and but even with that I am conscientious that okay I need to make sure that I finish all my charts on the same day please I can addendum it for example like something happened that I need to change I can just add done later. But I just make it a habit. really is a habit. Because last night is one of those days, like I feel tired, but I was able to get passed through them.
00:33:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so that feels good. Yes, that's it. So worst case scenario, let's say you don't finish a charting at the hospital or at the clinic. But if you make the rule, I will not go to bed until I finished my charting.
00:33:27 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Then you never wake up with any kind of dread and you never allow the negative compounding to happen to you again.
00:33:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because that's when you start to feel the pressure really build and really mount.
00:33:38 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, that's the time I feel like I still do feel that I work more. But and maybe I kind of correlated to how much I was getting paid early. So it's hard to it's hard to correlate that. But I definitely have this is probably the first work. that I have that I have a lot of other than the autonomy, it's the flexibility with the staff. Because I mean, I don't have to go in a hospital, I can go whatever time I want, I can go tonight, if for example, or I can go very early. As long as I see the patients, I did it. They can they actually still call me throughout the day. Hey, know, this page, the paging system, Dr. E wants it to go to him, whatever, that's fine. But some of the nurses and doctors have my number, so they text me directly and they hit patient pains still like this. And I make changes throughout the day. And this is kind of like putting out fires throughout the day, not just in the hospital, but in the clinic. So it's, you know, or telemedicine, it's just what it is that I'm so used to it. I think the manager, I need to work on not responding to email. But it's so hard for me not to respond. the email because the Gmail it's connected to my phone. So like yesterday the manager messaged me a lot of patience.
00:35:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can just set up an auto reply that just you know if something is urgent.
00:35:13 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
This is what you need to do text me. But it's more of me. I wanted to respond. I wanted to it's kind of like charting my brain is like I need I want to respond to solve this problem right away. This is that and I told her she probably is thinking with my response. It's like midnight.
00:35:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So just create some rules for yourself and stick to them because that's the same way that you you did the charting. But first you have to decide that this is what it's going to be and then you have to buy in and commit to it. But as long as you leave the question mark open you're not going to make a consistent behavioral choice because you haven't decided I will always behave this way. If you leave it as a possibility. of these and you're going to keep defaulting to I probably should do it rather than I will do it between these hours and these hours and not else or I will do it via text and text only like whatever the rules are make them then keep them because it creates the most peace for you and it um imagine okay so imagine you have like a hundred million gallons of water if you just that's just spread on the earth it's just basically mist and paper if you had a hundred million gallons of water in a channel this big can you imagine the force of it so it's the same volume but when you channel things you change the force and you change the power so if you now think of that as energy instead right if your energy is spread out all hours of the day and allowed to go this way that way not where wherever you're get called from Gmail from text All hours a day. Your energy is not concentrated.-hmm. That means the force of your energy is diminished You're not going to be resting well. You're not going to be energized. You're not going to be rejuvenated And so your efficacy your potency is going to be diminished.
00:37:17 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Does that make sense?-hmm. Yes, so Was I I think that dr. E or mark, but I think mark is better in Managing that then dr. is just all over the place and I I kind of feel bad, but that's what he wants So Well in the end off like do they you know for some people it's almost like a defense mechanism like it keeps them from thinking about other things or feeling other things and And there's a lot of that especially in men. don't want to feel things and
00:38:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and we're just kind of forced to feel things so we can do it. And sometimes people simply don't consider potency. I consider potency. want to be powerful as I could be and that requires that I maintain everything in a particular way and organize it with intent. And some people consider that that dispersant as being potent because they're covering more mass right rather than having a larger impact on a smaller sphere. I'd rather have a larger impact on a smaller sphere and not everybody does. So that's why I'm asking you like you have to decide what you want and then you need to be okay with whatever you decide. So if you decide you want to be available at all times and just answer whatever comes in then decide that but then don't say I'm doing it wrong or I probably shouldn't do it because then you create this conflict in yourself and that's not good for you.
00:39:00 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
I, I agree. Also, I was, there's a couple of things that I, it comes to mind while we were talking. So, this might be, it's like all over. First, my question is, do you think, how do I ask this question? When I went to that lunch and learn with Dr. E and another doctor with the law firm. I dressed up, I put the white coat, but I'm in, I'm in a long dress. And I bought, I have two cars, Mark got me like two cars. I have a Prius that I love that I so easy and I'm in the carpool lane. So, I love that for my everyday dress. But I got that I have a pink Porsche.
00:39:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have seen a picture of the pink Porsche.
00:39:48 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
I love it. So, and, and I don't know in your opinion, are things, the pink Porsche is too much, the Prius is also underwhelming. So, he thinks, but He drives up his daily BMW. So he thinks that's like the perfect balance in between. But I mean, I don't use that. So does it matter? Like, I don't want the law firm to think that I don't know. guess, appearance, like, that's my question.
00:40:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Your energy will override everything. OK, so this is what you need to understand. So people are always going to inform opinions about you.
00:40:28 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Right.
00:40:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you can't satisfy any of them. There were those who will say, that Porsche is perfect for Tona. I love that. She's a whole package, right? truer that you are to yourself, the better. And that is a potency to you. So you will probably repel more people, the more authentic you are. But the people that you attract will be more powerfully attracted to you, more truly attracted to you. And they will end up being your most potent allies. So to me, potency, authenticity.
00:42:00 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
I love bags in general. So I remember I have a patient, a PI, a lean patient in Dr. E's office because he and then he saw my bag and then he's like, I'm in a different field. He made that comment. So again, like you said, casting a whiter, like, but this is who I am. But I love his and also that my portion.
00:42:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like, it's a tiny bit of who you are. You're also person that is like, I want you to not be in pain.
00:42:33 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
I want you and whether it's Dr.
00:42:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
E or Cheryl or your patients, like, I want to come here and make your life better.
00:42:40 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
I want to show up and do a great job. Like, Tony, you're all of these things.
00:42:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you are the pink force of a person. You're not the everyday person. You're shiny. You're beautiful. You're smart. inside out. so it's just a representation of your uniqueness and you're embracing a beautiful things, but those beautiful things are also like look at your love for your family and your loyalty to your family.
00:43:08 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
That's a beautiful thing.
00:43:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it's also kind of right like that's not how everybody feels about their family. So it's actually a good symbol how you present yourself, your humility like you don't to me don't come across as arrogant and judgmental. You probably have to like that.
00:43:31 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, I don't like those.
00:43:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So you have to trust that that's actually way more powerful. There's the saying that and I don't remember but I think it was my Angelo who said people won't remember what you said but they'll remember how you made them feel. Right. So you really just trust your energy, trust the way that you show up energetically and that that will override everything else. And then when they do that and they see the pink horse, they'll be like, yeah, that makes sense, because you know, she's done. Yes, it's fine.
00:44:09 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
But, um, yeah, that was, that was the first, I forgot my second question too, but that was, that was the first question is about appearance. I don't want to turn off people that, you know, I don't want to, again, I can't please everyone, but at the end of the day, it's just what I can offer. And, you know, some will work, some won't.
00:44:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you don't want to please everyone, but even more, you want to identify everyone. You want to know who you're doing business with. Are they people that can accept you? Are they people that you can show up as yourself? Are they people that you can trust? Are they people who can look beyond what you drive, whether it's flashy or Prius or whatever? So go ahead and give them the test by just showing up exactly as who you are and see what
00:45:00 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
They can handle what they tell you about themselves. Right. Right. That's real good. think I remember Mark kind of going through that face too.
00:45:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:45:09 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Because, you know, especially when you're thinking, yeah, I think in his field, like, the lawyers, just, it's different, but that is, that is a very, yeah, kind of like cutthroat competitive, but also stowie, like, very showy, so happening, it doesn't, it doesn't end up, if you get this from Mark, but he doesn't feel good after he, he, he came from a, like a lawyer's conflict. It doesn't make him feel good. It, it kind of like put him down a little bit and he, because he compares himself to the other lawyers that he, we have that conversation from time to time.
00:45:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I, I don't really think about it. It's good to pay attention though to when he goes to conferences, but he does sometimes compare himself. I'm like, Mark, do any of them take care of their clients the way that you do? Do they care about them?
00:46:12 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Do they work in integrity?
00:46:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do they like, so are you, you're not playing the same game? Do you understand that you're not playing the same game? So we do have this conversation. I'm like, so if you're going to judge yourself for something like not being the best basketball player when you're over here playing chess instead, like that doesn't make any sense. Like what? What doesn't matter if they're the best at their game. Your game is respect and integrity and honor and it isn't the bottom line. know, you want to make all the money. I said, but you can do it playing your own game in your way and it's going to look different.
00:46:49 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
So you've got to stop comparing with that conversation. Yeah. Oh my God. He's all he is the old AI. don't know if he talked to him already. like he's definitely telling me that you wanted this but that's why he was telling me and I was like you will be changed you know he's like telling me that oh the healthcare will change up like okay so you're telling me that someone will you know be able to have a license to prescribe all these medications like and he said yeah they will be smarter it's like okay did you guys look into the ethical but part of this thing because we're talking about human lives and it's not all perfect and AI can't take a Hippocratic oath like he's like yeah he's all he's definitely but and but he's he's so excited he's he's going home tonight hopefully I don't know what to do he's been really quiet I was like I almost checked on him this morning but I got an email reply to one of our business threads and I was like okay He's okay, but he came, he's in, um, I don't know anymore. I am. I know he went to Missouri today to meet the doctors. So it's a business, um, thing, because he finished a conference. So he went and meet doctors. And now he's on his way back here. So, but, um, yeah. But yeah, no, I, and there's a, um, Christian. I don't know if you, um, he mentioned that name, but he's the PT chiropractor he works with. And that's also another venue for me to get referrals. They wanted to have a dinner, but, you know, with the holiday and, and in busy. So it looks like it's gonna just happen next year. Um, so, and I don't want to, obviously I need Mark. I've met them, but I just feel like I know Mark would want to be there because he, he's, him and his wife are going to be there.
00:48:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, So, because we're getting close on time, want to make sure that we've got a plan for what we're doing. First of all, just keep doing what you're doing, that's amazing. So and keep the pacing in mind, okay, that if it goes super fast, it's not sustainable. So that's really, really important to notice. Now that you have Mondays and Tuesdays and clinic days, you're staying on top of charting and the rest of the week, you know that there's some time. Think about what day or days of the week and what maybe if there's a particular time block that you might want to set aside for making specific types of contacts. So and you could probably do this on a week by week basis. So maybe on a Saturday or Sunday, plan out your week, okay, on Thursday around two o'clock, I'm going to be reaching out to Washington people. These are the list of people I'm going to be contacting or maybe Wednesday, one o'clock, I'm going to be. a working on that document, right? The one that you showed me with like the ad that marks sent to you and like getting a version of that and typing it all up. if you type it up, then I can help you look at, you know. I don't know if that I need to do that in like a card calling card form or in a Google Doc at first and let's brainstorm it together, but if you read it out. So you're having running a little bit rough, but for me, it's mostly because there's going to be words I don't see every day.
00:50:28 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
So I'm not positive that they are.
00:50:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, OK, so if you do that, then we can work on it. So what you're going to want to do, first of all, every week you're working on continuing to optimize what you already do, what's existing on your plate, right? Just keep showing up, doing it well, not getting behind, but also just know if there's anything you can do to improve it. It's going to be, you know, micro improvement over time, not big huge whiz bang, like, whoo, that was amazing. Just studying improvement. And then. The other thing is, okay, now what do you introduce each week? What do you do to create the growth and to create some traction and momentum and that begins to build? So one of the things would be to take note of what are the different types of activities you can do.
00:51:16 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
So like, are there specific types of people, specific types of events, dinners with, you know, contacts you already have, following up with old contacts, trying to obtain new contacts, like what are the specific types of activities you can engage in and what a point The one that you will, but Mark said that there's actually an advantage to me that he cannot do is for female contacts, I don't know if it's appropriate, I don't know, you tell me, like you guys can set up like spa type of thing, like, you know, for female, for in the, you know, it's an expense obviously for me that it's something that I can do. I know those places. I love and obviously like I like my tea area so I know where to go. So that's, I don't know what do you think about it too?
00:52:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think you have to take it case by case and I probably wouldn't start a brand new relationship that way unless you somehow knew that they really just love that. And feel it out like is that something you go okay well maybe we just go for pedicures right as a icebreaker because it's side by side or you know that type of thing. But yeah trust your intuition that's not going to be for everybody. Some women are not comfortable with any of that.
00:52:40 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Right but too I do love my friends but I do tea time with my, I call them luck luck luck friends because you know not all people love luxury and yeah we have, I have a very specific friends that love luxury and they're very bougie.
00:52:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yes not everybody. So yeah, so it's, you know, it's, you know, it's a nice experience to have to, but yeah, anyway, go ahead. You just meet them, meet them where they're at, but yes, you can, you can, as a woman have kind of different interactions. And that's the whole thing, just be you, like how do you normally interact with somebody, but meet them where they're at, what they're comfortable with that also works for you.
00:53:25 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Right. Yeah. Yeah. I have a, and my, I actually am thinking Mark's like, he's putting all these ideas on me is, you know, he's amazing, you know, not just because he's my husband, but he is, um, he's saying that for your birthday next next year, like you, we can set up something big and you can invite them and that's a business thing. What it like to have like, actually that's not a bad idea, um, by that time we're talking about six months from now, I hope that I will be, I should very you know I should be confident and I know the flow of my routine and it would be a good actually time to do that.
00:54:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah as long as there people you know that you want to spend time with.
00:54:15 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Yeah but I think I'm excited now I'm thinking because I did I know you're going but it's like last year I have just a I did a Bridgerton type T with my with my friends and I invited an opera singer. Oh my gosh yeah so you know I know I don't know if you know this but Mark throws like Artie. We didn't do it this year but last year it's good so the same person who did that is where I got this person from so it's very rigid and I will send it to you but yes but it doesn't have to be like that I'm saying that I know how to connect to throw up parties when I'm saying yes which is going to be a good for my friends obviously my friends to be there but for business contact would be a good place to kind of look forward to I think well especially if you as a hostess know how to make somebody feel comfortable who's not maybe normally comfortable at events like that if you can make people feel special like they're really matter than being there even though it's full of tons of people that's an opportunity for you to show them you know that that you're someone that they can really enjoy and that they matter so that I was already excited like I didn't do one this year but I am excited for next year I hope you can come we And I'm pretty sure we have a Wednesday next week on the 11th at one o'clock p.m. Okay, I think because my Thursday I put you I'm gonna delete this because I have a alarm on my every Thursday. But anyways, I think this is perfect. Actually just weeks like I need to do every day in the morning and then I helped you and I feel good.
00:56:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's how she started laughing. I feel good anyway.
00:56:31 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
Okay, thank you.
00:56:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're welcome.
00:56:34 - Chona Sweet, DNP ( wspainclinic)
You're welcome. yes.
00:56:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Enjoy that. You're amazing. I just love hearing your stories and love watching you just grow and evolve. I'm very glad that Mark let us work together. I know. Thank you. It makes me happy. Okay, enjoy the night. Bye.

Hey, hey.
00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, What's going on? When did I need my name?
00:00:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because I'm sick. Sick has got the blood drawn yesterday morning and you're just having.
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, my daughter came home sick and she got. So I've got my inhaler and been taking my silver and I already feel better but I'm still like.
00:00:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Got it.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then this morning my daughter comes in and she's flashing light in the darkness in my eyeball. And I'm like and I never say Jesus Christ and I say Jesus Christ.
00:00:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry.
00:00:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, I thought she was talking about my daughter for a minute.
00:00:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It could be a dog.
00:00:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Dog. I walk out and I smell this god-awful smell. I'd never smelled before and The dog was filming at the mouth.
00:01:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like what's going on. I'm like it's got me a skunk But it didn't smell like a skunk, but it was filling up my whole house the smell Oh God.
00:01:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it smelled like chemically and Not like a skunk, but it had to have been just a weird skunk We've had these experiences before it did permeate through the whole house if my daughter Mm-hmm up just smelling her dog. Yeah, she got sprayed right in the mouth dog So that's how I woke up and it wasn't even seven o'clock yet in the morning Yeah, so that on top of being sick and we had like body aches in my just yeah But and I feel good enough I get the job done, so Walk up and did my missionary stuff and I snuck like a shower during one of the calls because we're not on video and I muted myself and I'm like I'm just gonna listen and get my shower and right after I got out they like had a question for me so I'm like nobody knows and it's okay so so what did you do with the dog then what's happening with the dog right now she's okay okay yeah she it just had happened so she hadn't processed it and body but she had some water and she was too a lot just making that face and she's okay and I couldn't believe how much this because we have medical grade at HEPA filters throughout the house since COVID but also we all have asthma and the pollen around here is insane yeah so it did a really good job of clearing out smell pretty well and I can't believe it. leave because I prayed. I'm pretty sure miracles are just happening because the oils in the skunk are just they're pervasive. They take a long time to dissipate and go away. She didn't get a bath or anything but it's yeah it's the worst and the best skunk experience we've ever had. Worst as in how bad it was but best isn't how quickly it's it's like we still smell it but anyway she's okay she's out barking her head off right now. Oh my gosh and you're on fire yeah your pad just being like breaking it down. I watched while I was on my training for a minute because there were some because there was the board so I was like that's awesome.
00:03:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah yeah no yeah yeah I'm excited and I had a really good call this guy yesterday that's potentially more like just for me on the off offer stuff because he had a funnel builder that was doing stuff for him and that funnel builder just changes business model to not have any customers anymore and he's just gonna focus on his own offers. So he was wondering if I could take over and run ads for him and all that jazz. So I'm like, okay, cool. Yeah, let's do it. So yeah, that's kind of what's happening now is is to later on today, I told him said I want him to think I was a what do you go? Desperate of this that so he asked if I could send him just a detailed either a contract or or send him a details of what's more out of scope. That's what he'd like to learn more about. Not what's in scope. was going and so 5,000 months didn't phase him at all. So let's do it for 90 days, but obviously if you don't like it or you're You don't like it, you know, whatever, like I'm not going to hold you to the 90s, but I feel we should have that at least, but you got legs like I looked at his funnel. He just needs to optimize it. And I think it'll rock for him. And I also believe I don't know if you're like this now to I don't believe high ticket sells so well in this economy. So he needs in the real estate niche. He's a realtor. He's very successful what he does. And he's got a great book.
00:05:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think he wants to become like the next brand new chart, which I think is really cool. I don't it's the economy.
00:05:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I want to talk after that. Okay, sure. Okay, yeah, yeah, we love to talk. This is that is a podcast episode or video for us to do. So, but yeah, so he's trying to send them into a $3,500 thing. And I said, you know, honestly, if I run your shoes, I really feel you should have more 500 or 900 or 300 thing to assemble too. And I think that's going to make you 50k months easily with this funnel because the real estate niche have been in it. I'm very experienced and I even how I was there when Chris Michore just started because I was with the ad agency So, you know, saw her when she was nobody and everybody knows who she is, but she started in real estate now She teaches all things business, but uh, so anyways, um, yeah He's certainly open to that because I really feel You're setting yourself up for fail failure because then you have a sales team then you gotta deal with this and he doesn't want that He makes good money in his real estate business.
00:06:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He doesn't want to deal with that or manage people.
00:06:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So anyways Um, he's Looked like he's a yes. Uh, yeah yesterday on the phone. He and he on zoom call We energetic are really aligned the Ford for his book was written by one of his friends who's Bob Berg of the go-giver So like he's very heart centered Um, person so um, anyways, I understand he just wants to know what's in scope. What's not in scope Is it okay? I'll just craft you I told him I'd do it tomorrow, is today So once I have that then that will alleviate a lot of pressure to have five thousand Coming in for that, plus he's a fun guy to work with.
00:07:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I thought as soon as you said the price point, and for 90 days I'm like, okay, that just created the space that you need it. But it's actually because, but what you also need is you need the boon of what's been, what you've been having to deal with is the energy of it. wouldn't say it started with Carina, but it definitely maybe was probably most noticeable and painful with Carina of not being respected. That is an emotional heart pain, and you had Rudy, and I'm coming from these kinds of experiences as well. I'm speaking because I know what they feel like to not be honored, especially when you show up and give everything.
00:07:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, yeah, let me turn my box around. And this is to have some
00:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
but nickel and dime you.
00:08:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, try to be miserly with you.
00:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But say, I see your expertise at that price makes sense to me, at least like it isn't a done deal yet. But yeah, once you start dealing with people who honor you, you are your energy is completely different. You're not coming from a defensive and making space and now your creativity flows.
00:08:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Also your generosity increases because your fear can diminish because you know that there are good people out there.
00:08:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's very cathartic and releasing and powerful. But when you're already a generous person, it actually increases your generosity because somebody kind of restored your faith and humanity a little bit, you know. But something to think about. So in terms of the economy, there is just as much money as there always has been. If not more, it has shifted. There's a greater priority, but the bigger issue. is the economy of trust. The trust economy has what's been most damaged. So there are too many people stealing and promising big things. And hey, I'm so and so, and you just get my time. You get access to me, you get access to my community.
00:09:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's worth $10,000, it's not.
00:09:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need results for $10,000. So and most of these things are just, here let me throw all of this information at you, but there are a lot of gaps. It's not actionable. There, there isn't a support system where you can ask a specific question where you need to get. So for most people, they have realized, so this is the trust part, it's part of the trust is that they need, if they're going to spend that much money, it needs to get them a certain level of results. They're really, like people didn't ask this question. and have this realization that they're giving to you this week, which is I need an implementer because they realize they're not the one. So people that used to throw money away and the whole just kind of energy that you could do this throw money away and you would get something out of it doesn't exist anymore. There's a whole new market, but the market is coming in more educated realizing I can't just give five or ten thousand dollars and my life is going to change. So that's the big issue. can't there will be people who will pay money just for access, right? that's one thing that's my guy who's always told people people will pay for access and that's true. They will pay a lot of money to get into somebody's world. But that's not everybody. That's a small person and that person already knows what the value and the benefit of being in
00:11:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
in that connection is, right?
00:11:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the results, they've already calculated, they've already done that. Everybody else, which is the majority of the people need to have a tactical result, which is this thing that I can't talk myself into building, or I can't even comprehend how to build front like backwards and forwards, where I can build, but I don't know how to mark it, where I can mark it, but I don't know how to build that kind of thing that there's always one of those gaps, right? Yep. They need to have that solved. So for the person selling something, the person selling has to decide what do I want to deal with, okay? So we already know what we want to give and what we can sell and what we can offer, but there's a burden involved in fulfillment. So if the thing is we want to help realtors be better realtors. I want to help realtors be better realtors, but I just want to share with them what I know. I don't want to deal with customers. support. I don't want to deal with one on one calls. I don't want to deal with live events, right? So then you get a lower ticket thing that just says, here's what you can learn, okay? I just created a material for you. I don't have a lot to deal with it, so I'm going to give it kind of inexpensive, but I can give it over and over and over again because I know how valuable it is. So that person, you know, your guy who doesn't want to do a lot might consider that. The other thing he can consider is bringing in so maybe you create community and then you're looking for the excited kind of go-getters or the experienced person and then you deputize them and go, hey, would you be interested in being a moderator? Would you be interested in being a junior coach or whatever? And so now they build into the model, you take somebody that you acquired through the funnel to begin with to be a leader and those leaders, they're different because they're also loyal now. not like you went out and hired somebody. They found you, they already been sold and converted and they drank the Kool-Aid. So they're ideal to support your community and now you can charge a higher tier because now you can offer support but you're not doing it. You're facilitating it, you're paying for it, you've created a system that brings the leaders in, you create a system that can train the leaders so you can train your trainers but you don't actually do it. So he could be working with some high level people on occasion which helps him keep his saw sharp and just you know keeps tucked into his business and so like if the market ever just crashes he's got this other thing over here. love the market crashes he's not going to be a selling that very well. But anyway something to consider about that but I don't think so the economy is definitely bad but it's really mostly bad for people who struggle to get jobs in the first place. who, so for entrepreneurs if they're targeting broke people That was already an issue, which is Karina.
00:14:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And that's why her business. So I had put the glasses on and I prevent ice cream. Yeah, I really feel that sort of Karina in a way happened to her with her list. And that's why. Yeah, because they just weren't responding anymore. Like it was hard to get sales from the compared to a year ago. Same emails, right? So, yeah.
00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so that target matters. the people, but everything flows uphill, right? So, food chain. So if these entrepreneurs were targeting the rogue people who barely had money to begin with, who were just thrown it out because they couldn't, they're not getting paid. So these people that used to pay these people, these people aren't getting as much money. some of these people are creative and pivoting. So some of these people are getting that money. But these up here, you know, they're like having different conversations and pivoting more. So the majority of the shortage is here. The next level is here. The next level is here and so on. So the money and the money is flowing up, the shortage, but it's still there, it's still being generated and it's still being spent, it is the difference of who's targeting whom. Are you targeting people that have money or are you adjusting your offer to make it more available to them? But in addition to that, are you shifting what you're offering and support so that if you reduce your revenue, you're also reducing your burden, right? So maybe I'm still helping you, but I'm not giving you the one-on-one hand holding, because this price point doesn't allow me to do that, but I still want to lift you up and help you. Yeah.
00:15:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that make sense?
00:15:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, that's my feeling about how it's going, because there's still a lot of people just throwing money just going, yeah, no problem.
00:15:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let's go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I've evidenced by the sudden guy reached out to me, he sold his
00:16:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
company after the harmoses and so he wants to start a new funnel in the fertility nation wondering if I can help with that and they said yeah sure uh so you know we're just uh I should need to get back to them too so after we finish this call I need to go back to these people that are hanging loops what do you call it unfinished loops I would be happy to help you create your really clear and don't don't create the potential for scope creep because I don't want to see you be stressed out for your own reasons but for my selfish reasons too because then if you're stressed out then I don't get to play against myself yeah yeah yeah how must you do you mind if we a you You
00:20:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You Back hey, oh my god. She's painting the like she bugs me for food I gave her her food and then she walks away from her nose turned up Yeah, yeah Cuz she wants I put sometimes put a little bit of sliced ham on it, but I'm not gonna do that every single meal for her So she didn't like that. Yeah, she didn't eat it at lunch at two hours ago So I picked up put it back in the fridge with those cuz the wet food and expensive. It's like $4.50 for a little can of this cat food and she goes through a can of day and plus her dry food and so she turns and knows about it and so I put in the fridge and then now she was bugging me bugging me for food and so I put it back down on her when I was making my coffee and she looks at me and walks away.
00:21:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's hilarious. Is it too much cheaper than that?
00:21:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um you know it some of it is special ones on sale um that is Canadian dollars so 450 is probably 350 US or excuse me um but um I have given her tuna sometimes too but I guess with the special product a more holistic brand it has kind of more in it but the problem is she likes chicken flavored and Merlin the burnadoodles are allergic to chicken so if he gets in the cat food that's why he lifted he then gets the runs like the night two nights ago I was up three times during the night because he kept pawing at me go outside so you know it's not nearly as much of the painting you had this morning food.
00:21:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah and then I had to change their dog food um It's always like throwing up or dragging their butts across the ground and there's a lot of stuff outside that they can get into so I don't really know what's what but I was reading how much corn is in all the dog food and how bad it is to digest for any any of us really but so I got some food from Chewy that doesn't have any corn in it and they've been a lot better but yeah I can't see no little fur babies got to take care of them I know I know they are beautiful like oh no she's eating her wet her dry food so she said no to the wet food that's really expensive and the dry food is expensive nowadays too but anyways now she's stomping at that oh my god anyway um yeah so did you see my video that I did on my facebook page today I saw part of it I didn't get to see all of it but I thought that was awesome yeah and who I'm calling out now 50,000 And I'm embedding the seed, right?
00:23:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
yeah, if I come over here, so, yeah, 50k months from different parts, I'm just kind of embedding the seed. So, so, yeah, yep. All right, so I got this going. Let's go. You cool to start on this now or is that.
00:23:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, let's do it. So, I think the fastest way to start would be what do you already know that he wants to do so that what is the existing goal? Actually, that would be that's what I do is I reverse engineer every single time. What is the outcome that is desired? And then I work backwards and think about what has to happen to make that. And then I figure out what is the simplest way to accomplish that and what are the guardrails to make sure that I'm not. called out of it. If there's potentially something that could scope creep, I build that in and say, okay, if this needs to happen, you will pay for this. Maybe I'll manage it. Maybe I'll lead it, whatever. But just to be clear, if this is needed, I'm not doing it.
00:24:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. So he's got a couple outcomes desired. I'll just write them all down and then we can succinctly make it better if you want. So so the first thing is that the overall big outcome is that his avatar of and obviously this isn't going to go in a minute like this of who he wants to become is like a Brooke Castillo.
00:24:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you know Brooke Castillo? No.
00:24:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. She is the owner of owner of the life. Basically he wants to become a high-performance coach like a Tony Robbins Brooke Castillo. Okay. Or Brandon Bouchard, right? owner of life. So he wants to use the real estate RE course as a springboard to other other missions. don't know what you want to call it, but EG, he has a productivity course course. I think he'd love to have a relationship course. This is down the road like he'd like to just help people, right? His offer is called, his name's Grant Mueller.
00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know ever heard of him. He sounds very all over the board.
00:25:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, no, no. This is for long term. No, I could just go into the short term. Why call me? just you know that it's good, but it does help to have the overall thing. Yeah. So, I mean, the initial scope is basically optimizing this funnel. Also, he'd like to get to let me find the actual URL top of that yeah top of heart offer and this is converting not bad it's at 7% conversion so it actually isn't bad um he showed me the conversions but uh top of hearts he booked Bob Berg's written the four that's his friend as well but um you know as far as uh you know if we were just to go down to the real outcomes that he wants to um make a profit with this uh little ticket funnel funnel and that's called top of heart offer make a problem that's um he also said that it'd be he says i can afford the 5k right now no problem but it's coming out of my real estate business but i'd like your 5k month to be funded from this event as well. But basically, I think you'd like to get to 20k profit per month. I need to say an exact number. He kind of just said he wants to make it profitable. So let's just get rid of this.
00:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it currently like, does it lose money?
00:27:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What is that? Yeah, so the history is he hired this other guy, Vinny, to create the funnel like two, three months ago and run ads. And so the deal he had with him is that he charged in 10,000 to build the funnel and doesn't include up so one or upsell two, which is kind of like my little ticket offer. But he also runs ad for it. And because he knew that he had a $3,500 high ticket, he said, when you make your $10,000 back in sales of your high ticket, then I'll charge you $5,000 a month for continuing run ads and optimize the funnel. So Vince, a few weeks ago, decided to stop doing being an agency, um, you stopped everything. And he still likes Vince. He says, a good guy, but I have no one now, right? So the goal is to make it profitable. So he didn't really have the greatest numbers right now. And he was embarrassed about it, but said, I kind of need to know your numbers. He shared screen yesterday into his go ahead level account. That's why I knew he was converting at two at 7%. But no, he's, I don't know if he's profitable. I say no, because his average order value is probably only between seven and $10 because he had zero conversions of his order bump and zero conversions of up cell one. So I said, okay, right there, I know I can help you tremendously. So I already know you're under water because you're probably paying at least $40 cost per purchase. But I didn't want he was going to give me access to account. But I said, no, until we have a working relationship, I don't want to work, like expand my brain energy on that. But I know I can help you.
00:28:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how where is his current lead to coming from?
00:28:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's a new funnel. So paid traffic, Facebook ads.
00:29:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And what's, what's he paying? What's he getting? How many eyeballs are seeing it?
00:29:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, I don't know.
00:29:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I mean. I didn't want to look at his eyes. Okay. Okay.
00:29:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You don't know about it. Yeah. Yeah. Um, basically in the last, like, I think Monty had like 29 buyers. oh, he said he was spending 15, uh, I guess Vinny's deal with he does with people. He was spending 15, uh, $50 a day. And he's been running it for about six weeks. He said, these are all like, what happened, which I thought was kind of . But I'm not going to go into detail, slam, anyone or anything. But, um, because there's always two stories to it. Um, there was a slack channel that Vinny had with his clients that had all these numbers on it. And, uh, Vinny closed the slack account down. So, all that was gone. But still, that's up to him as the entrepreneur that he should have had a Google Sheet that showed weekly ad spend weekly So he also didn't know what he doesn't know, but he really, ideally the outcome is make this profitable, use it as a once he kind of feels he has it dialed in and knows doing like maybe launch other low ticket offers. Right now it's, you know, $7 offer. And he's got a lot of bombs and all that that I'd have to totally redo because they're not working. To a $3,500. I take it. Take it with more coaching. So, so the outcome desired is simply. Yeah, make a profit with the little take a funnel right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that that includes paying for me but I'm not going to say that in the document here. Oh, yeah.
00:30:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
let's do some quick math. which I shouldn't, I mean, basically, 5,000, 100 hours, hold on, let me do that. I thought, no, that's right. So roughly, if we were going to keep your EHR at 500, we'll, we'll make it 250, because 250 is still better than you've been doing, right? if you worked 20 hours a month for roughly five hours a week, that's roughly an hour a day. So that's I'm not saying that that's what you should do. And I don't think that you're necessarily in a situation to do that. I think you can do much better. And I think that even if you spend two hours a day for him every day, which would be 10 hours a week, which would make your effective hourly rate about $50, hold on a second, that's 5 out of 40, $125 an hour. So if you worked two hours a day, every pre-day of the week, your EHR would be about $125 an hour, which is still not bad. And I think that this is a process that you should do on a regular basis, just to kind of have an idea before you say yes, no to anything, whatever.
00:32:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And also it helps create the kind of scope.
00:32:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
in the two hours a day, there's a lot that you could do. There's a lot of research, there's a lot of copywriting, there's reporting time, there's all kinds of things that would go into. One of the things I always do for my clients, which very few people do for them, is I set up something for them and then make them owners. So I used to use base camp. Now I'm using Trello because base camp is more expensive and it's more convoluted than it used to be. And Trello is still very simple. It's just camben boards and I can invite them and then I can make them owner, where you can't do that with base camp. You can't somebody to an admin owner whatever. But that way, because you want to teach them, and this is a gift that you're giving them. to own their reporting, own their data, own their stuff, no matter who they work for. So a lot of people, and this is again kind of my leadership style and what I give to them is I teach them, delegate, don't abdicate, but most people abdicate. They say, they think, I give you my money, this is your responsibility now, no, because they don't care about your business like you do, they don't, you know, all that, anyway. So, so keeping all of these in mind, one of the things I would do is, let's say, and I would write this down, and I can, I can take some bottom notes too, but I would start with one of the things I'm going to do for you is create a project management suite there. So it's going to be a Trello board where we're going to track all of the things that are going to get done, and I'm going to task by everything so that you will be able to see what I'm doing, when it's due, or whatever is doing, if we end up hiring somebody to do something, and you will be be able to see everything that happens as it happens and you'll have a record of it moving forward. So if you want to duplicate this across another one of your products, you'll have the project mapped out that you could find what's usable and duplicated to the next one. So this is an asset I'm creating for you that you'll be able to use again and again. Because now you're value-stacking, right? not like I'm just not just getting you the money that you want. I'm creating assets and value that are going to have compounding benefits for you. But the other part of that is now you've got something that shows your work and keeps people from breathing down your neck. Well yeah but Maria didn't get me the results, I didn't get the sales, I wanted whatever. Okay well you can see Maria strategically went down through the list and your offer still didn't convert. know that because you can't make everything convert well whatever. There's a lot that goes into that. Anyway, so the next thing I would do, but I would have done this before coming into it since your job is conversion, I would have looked at the ads. And I would have looked at the ad account because just even though you know the conversion rate, you don't know how bad or good the ads are. Like if they're really good ads and he's spending $50 a day and can only get that, that's a red flag, that's an issue, that means you're going to have an uphill battle.
00:35:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, because because he doesn't have his funnel done, it's only front end funnel at seven bucks.
00:35:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yes, so that's an additional part, but if you have a hard time getting even front end sales with $50 a day, then that would be a concern that I would have, but if it was a really good ad, I doubt that that's the case, but I would have wanted at least that much information before I said yes for sure, like, at least show me one of your ads, so I know and look at it and go, yeah. There's so much opportunity.
00:36:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, he was willing to put me on the ad account, but I just, and also I've worked with him before.
00:36:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He is good at ads. almost hired him a while ago for a client for ads.
00:36:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like he's, so no, I think the ads are performing because for him to get seven percent conversion on 50 bucks a day on the fact that the funnel doesn't have any conversions on the order and no conversion upsell one. Like to me, there's so much opportunity there and just optimizing the funnel.
00:36:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, if you did one of your calculators and put in two order bumps, like, um, just next level, right? Do you, so you'd have to know what does he have that he could give in between an offer, um, between the seven and the 3500?
00:36:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Is there anything that he sells? Yeah, that's my job to figure out because he does have stuff and he gave me access to his whole drive to look at it. I said, look, we just need to create for you like a 297 product or a thousand dollar product.
00:36:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much did that, would you, have to do.
00:37:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, I don't have to create it, but what I'll do is probably will take me only hour to look at all of his existing assets, because he even said, honestly, Maria, Vinny had me create three bonuses for this similar product. And one of these bonuses, I think, could be the $297 if I just flush it out more. Nice. So yeah, it's kind of like what I did with Crena. Like, Crena had that $20 funnel, $50 average order value working with me. I increased to like $105 or more average order value. And instead of sending people to her $4,800 thing, I said, we just need to create a $1000 product. Oh, you're, she already had it. She already had it. So I said, we just need to create a decent enough sales page for it. Here's your VSL script for it. I outsourced the power graphics for it. And we also created the payment plan or 12 for 99, 12 months, and people stay in several months, and she's going to get 15%.
00:37:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, your most of your work is getting to done in the beginning. One thing I would require is a 90 day contract because you're going to spend most of your time in the beginning and not in that end. And so you kind of get cheated. And that's the thing that I would say is, okay, 5000 a month, this is a target, but it has to be a 90 day. And I would tell him because I'm going to work extra hard in the beginning. And so if you cut me out of because you're going to have to do the research, do the strategy, write the copy, create the ads, do the targeting, manage the ads, tweak the copy and the ads, according to whatever happens, create the nurturing sequence or the ascension or any of any of the follow up sequence. is in order to get people from opt-in to buying and then buying to upsell and so on until they've exhausted all of that. You know you're going to look at his email deliverability because you're not going to want him using email and then you're not touching it. I imagine you would anyway, I can't imagine you're not taking a peek at that and making a suggestion, right? So your mental energy is going there. there's probably going to be some graphics that need to be created in order to support the ad campaign, the landing pages, things like that. And the sequences, now we're talking about automations to an extent. It may be minor and it may be just people consider that part of the job, but it's still your knowledge and expertise.
00:39:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is a lot that's happening.
00:39:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So technically you're doing like three people's jobs. So well, four. So the media buyer, the copywriter, the graphic designer, and the automation expert, those are for roles that if you have a decent team, you're going to have those four roles are going to be different people, and you're doing all of it. So the other thing that you might build in is say, okay, if I get you to X point, then I get a performance bonus. And I will have earned it.
00:40:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Right. I know my friend Kira, and she's this is how she dealt with student McLaren and another gal that she's now running huge ads for the dinner clients for three years. She started out at 2500 a month plus 10% of ads. And now she's at, I think, 3000 month, the 10% of ads, but she makes 30,000 month for me client. because she grew, she's so good at what she does. Actually, I trained her that, um, you know, she, she got them to be able to profitably scale ads.
00:41:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you need to include that in your pedigree. Yeah, I'm in the notes.
00:41:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What's her name? Cara. Sure.
00:41:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She probably wouldn't want she. No, no, you don't have to tell her name. Yeah, I was gonna say her name. No, I don't like telling people's names. I, I'm not going to do that in myself. I'll describe the company because it just feels not good. You know, I don't want people talking about my business. My business is my business and I don't do other people. Um, but, but I want you to tell that story. So Cara, I'm going to put this in a highlight as a task that add that to your thing that you train somebody that does this. Like that's part of your pedigree.
00:41:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, there's a few, Kimmy is the same. She's making a killing and she was my practice for a few years.
00:41:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. but does she do all of these things that you would be doing or does she?
00:41:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, she, she, she, She just does the ads because these people have a team, Stu McClellan has a copywriter, he has a copywriter, but what I could do, I could tell them the graphics design cost is out of scope. I could say I know what I want from the graphic design, but I could say that's out of scope, that the cost of outsourcing graphic design elements. And it's not going to be much, but still, know, it could be 100 to 200, don't you think I figure, right?
00:42:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. It depends on what you need. if you're creating, if you're creating a pretty PDF, that takes a lot more time and energy, even for one of my Filipinos, like I might pay $100 just for that, just for the PDF. But then to get the 3D images and what might be $25. So those parts are not that expensive. But when you, when you are creating a new e-book, the PDF itself targets, it's expensive. So the graphics, not so bad. content that needs to be beautified. That's a little bit more expensive.
00:43:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Beautiful. Yeah, because the book's not really beautified.
00:43:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, but in the presentation matters. Like if I give you a piece of chocolate cake, have I told you this example before? No, tell me.
00:43:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If I give you a brand new company, Tina, I'll talk to you girl.
00:43:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I actually learned this in terms about presenting the gospel.
00:43:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It was funny, but it has universal applications.
00:43:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Presentation matters. So if you see me go cut a slice of a beautiful bakery cake, and I put it on a lovely elegant plate and hand it to you with a fork and a napkin, you know, that's one presentation. Now if I throw it on a paper plate, give it to you with a plastic fork. That's another level, but it feels a little bit different. It feels more elegant when you give it to me with all of that, you know, and it feels special. And but then if you give it to me on a paper plate with a fork, I'm just like, it's delicious, dig in, you know, I'm still here. Now, if you scoop it out with your hand and you put it in my hand, I'm like, I don't think I want it. And if you take tape cake and you throw it on the floor and then you pick it up and give it to me, I'm like, you crazy, go away. Right. it's the same. If you eat it other than the dirty part, it's the same, but how you present it matters. So our content, especially when you're talking about like ADHD, executive dysfunction, and also just depression and anxiety, based on color psychology, we know that colors have energy and they evoke emotion. So if you've just got a plain ugly thing, the emotion, you're not, you're not optimizing the emotion. But if you can create it in colors that create warmth and trust, so like blues and yellows and greens and oranges, that's why. If you look at the biggest brands, almost all of them use blue. Look everywhere. Any kind of thing. There is blue. Google uses it. You go look in your bathroom, go look at the biggest brand names that you buy. There is blue all over them. Because blue is trust. So green is travel, oranges, action, black is luxury, red is luxury also. But anyway, all these kinds of things, yellow is calming, but also trust. blue and yellow are used a lot. Anyway, but then if you like, if you have large chunks of text and it's small text versus the parallax type of design, right, and images. broken up through here so that the eye flows left to right and it's not glorious because or let's say they want to go back to a piece of content and they lost their place for a second and now they got to go through this chunk of text but but that chunk of text they wanted was right next to this particular image and they can find it easy. Most people aren't thinking about this the mental effort that people have to go through to consume their content. Yeah this makes a big impact because how can they be raving fans if they never consumed your stuff. So anyway this is something that again you you can just bring to the mix and you make beautiful images and you do this naturally but most people don't.
00:46:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know it's true whenever I've hired someone to help with graphic design Tina I'm just like oh you really suck at colors.
00:46:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can do this better.
00:46:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah like like like that's what I'd say to people like Sally lover and she's been a client of mine for for 15 years in customer mind. Cara, by the way, too, she was one of my first testimonials 10, 12 years ago. you know, now she's doing rocking, rocking it. yeah, when they put stuff together, I'm just like, oh, that's like, come on, girl, let's fix this up.
00:47:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have so much to bring to the table.
00:47:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry. I know, I know I'm excited about that. So, so, yeah, okay. So, so, so I've got a lot in here. This is a lot of stuff in here. Um, do you want to just want to lock it down?
00:47:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am here for whatever and you can tap me down. I get excited about everything. I'm the same way in Sunday school.
00:47:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So you can just be like, Tino can wait.
00:47:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, should I include the longterm outcome or no, that you said, I do. So, but I break things up and stages. So I'll give the full vision because I want them to see that I can see this and I want to get excited about it. And if I like working with them, I want to stay with them. So I'm going to draw the whole picture out. But I won't scare them with a commitment of, you know, you don't have to we don't have to do all that together. I can start with just this, but I want you to see that this is what I see that we could be working on.
00:48:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, so, so how do I quantify or say the full vision? just said, you know, Brooke is there. So yeah, actually I'm like coach certified by her lover. And I think she scaled too fast, though. And I know she's having some issues. But he said that that's I just love her thought model. I love what she does for people, helping them be better you and stuff. And that's what I eventually want to be in. He has, I noticed in some of this stuff in his book that I started reading, he has talked about high performance like himself. This is his first email that sucks, by the way, but this is the book. And you're right, the, the, the, this is not bad top of heart. I got my attention, I saw that. But he definitely is kind of talking about himself as more of a peak performance person, how to approach your business, save my life. I think I save yours too. We talked about how he almost died because he was a mathematics and a dealer. So I've only read the first quarter of it last night and it was interesting. It did hook me. But yeah, I think he could make this better. This is because I think it was on Amazon. think it's kind of like this because it was a written book as well.
00:49:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, what I would do too and what I want to do with everybody that I work with where I'm any kind of operator is I need to know what the values are but I need to know the overarching value. What is the most important thing? So why does he want to be like Tony Robbins? Does he want to be hero worshiped or does he want to help as many people as he can? Now, he's not going to tell you he wants to be hero worship. Your job is to pay attention then to figure out if he's congruent or not. And here's what you need to understand also if he was a meth addict, he has an addictive personality. Addicted personality means he needs that dopamine hit and he can get that from hero worship. So those are red flags that you have to watch out for is that they need a drug and that can get in the way and that can cause them to sabotage business. So you don't have to fix all that you just need to be aware of it and so but but what you can start with so look at that and you know there's love that he is feeding off the energy that is his drug and it's okay because we all have our stuff but you just you just want to know that you understand why he's all over the but board is because he's chasing dopamine he's chasing his hit. So if you can in managing the business provide the hits. right? Then then he's going to be happy. Whether he can speak it or not, what he needs is to feel feel that that energy coming back to him. So if we could go back to your document?
00:51:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yep. I just lay that down chasing dopamine.
00:51:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:51:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All right. There it is.
00:51:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. So, um, there is like, what did Tony Robbins do before he became Tony Robbins? then the Tony Robbins we know now is not the Tony Robbins we knew 10 years ago, 20 years ago, whatever. Now he's doing stuff with his wife and leading women. And so one of the things you want to do is put things in perspective as to where he has now, where he was five years ago, where he wants to be. And to know that there is a pace that you can influence.
00:51:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
if you try to force it, you're going to break things.
00:51:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So this is why I talk about sustain up growth. And people that are that have addictive personalities, which I would say that I do, but I've worked on that a long time and didn't very conscious of it. So I didn't make me get a crowding it.
00:52:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Was that me too probably as well?
00:52:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:52:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that me?
00:52:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
kind of lost my train of thought. But anyway, it was that they'll sabotage things by if they're not filling what they need to do. So you kind of need to help crowd them. And so chunking things out so full vision is just kind of building out what the process is. So we could say, okay, you're here. Here's where you want to be, you know, Tony Robbins level. So one of the things that I would ask him, which is way beyond the scope of support, but it will help you knock this out of the park. If you want to. Um, would be, what is it about Tony Robbins and Brooke that you specifically want to have? Is there anything about them that you're not interested in having in their business? And I would describe, I would have them describe, you know, what does that day look like? does that, that year look like the year in the life of, um, grants?
00:53:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, Tony, do me ask him that messenger right now?
00:53:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not yet. I'll send you these notes so you can go do that later. Um, so then you could say, all right. Well, we know that we can't get there by the end of this year, but maybe we could get there in the end of five years. But in the meantime, you need this to be profitable. And then you want to build out the next offer and the next offer, right? So, we would say the first, you know, six to nine months, our job is to build out, um, is to optimize. This particular offer and do it so well that when you get to creating the next offer that we've got the system down and we can basically replicate it for your next offer. So you're priming him to and that's in a sum to close. We're going to be working together nine months from now. If you want it, right? And that's not manipulation. It's just what I've noticed after the fact. I always operated like that. And then somebody told me, I like your sons of clothes. I'm like, what? What is that? I didn't know. It wasn't a technique. It was just me being me.
00:54:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was just like, well, of course, like, why would I not think about it that way?
00:54:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So basically six, nine months build out this offer to profits and do it so well, we'll replicate it for other niches you mentioned productivity relationships. Yes, but immediately after you say that, you're going go now, don't think that I mean it's going to take nine months to profit. I mean that we've matured it to the point that we can now replicate it to the next product. So now you break out the timeline for making this profitable. So me knowing you, I think within the next 30 days, you will have mapped out two order bumps, created the sales pages, landing pages, and ads, whatever necessary for those order bumps.
00:55:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
One order bump and then optimize, just because I don't know if go high level has the ability to order bumps.
00:55:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't want to get into technology. Okay. So, yeah, that's a technical language as to how it works, but you know what I mean? think is really what we call it differently. order bump, cell one, there we go, which I always think is not about just dropping the price. Hey, if you didn't like it, that price, here's another one, because that sounds out of integrity. But if you didn't like that, here's a smaller version of it at a lower price. Anyway, so in 30 days, all of that should be mapped out and live. Now, they might balk and think that that's not fast enough. But there's a lot that goes into getting that done correctly. And he's going to have to create more ourselves. So we want to make sure that that happens. 30 to 60 days, then, from day 30 to day 60, is we're observing and potentially, by the way, at the end of 30 days, also having a split test mapped out for headlines or call to action or price, but not all of the above for each of the things that we have going on. So one split test. for every landing page mapped out an on deck for live by the end of 30 days. That's a total agency because everything you're telling me now if I had you five years ago we'd be 50 million a year. I did actually and incredibly fast. It's Arthur Tubman and yeah and and then he ruined it by overselling and pissed me off and I quit and then he got a divorce and yeah and he was also a drug addict. Got it. Recovering. Yeah I do know what I'm doing actually. Yeah I'm scaling agencies but but I also know they're the biggest reason I have most of the guardrails I have is because this is a very difficult model and the clients that you take are make or break because most of them are high pressure and if you get these people who have these arbitrary goals and they're They throw a ton of money at an agency and the agency says yes when they shouldn't have because the client was out of integrity Trying to 10x and it just destroys everybody along the way And yeah, okay, so can we scroll back down when you're when you're ready? Okay, so matter of fact, I have phases mapped out I don't even remember what they are, but I know what I would make and I have all these phases for growing the agency But day 30 to 60 is just monitoring optimization and it's more split testing Split testing the abs again headlines call to action and images Sometimes price point kind of just depends on what's happening but Um The thing about split tests, which I know you know is that you have to have a certain amount of conversions before you can declare a winner, so that requires the amount of volume to be happening. And so people will be like, well, okay, did it win or did it not win? You can't force the declaration of a winning split test until you have volume period, because you want to be confident that you know, and it takes roughly 100 conversions to have some certainty. And that depends on how big the gap is anyway, on the split test. Today 30 to day 60 is optimizing and seeing how it's doing. And it's also getting some customer feedback. And it's filling the holes. So something probably got missed, maybe on an automation level, maybe a pixels not firing, maybe the data is not reporting correctly. But it's fixing anything that got broken during the first phase of 30 days, while we were building something always goes wrong, it needs to be fixed and handled and that takes time.

One thing is that if Karina, that's working really well, mean put this as a post and nothing held back as just value add. The VA, I told her to hire from online jobs.ph, I told her to look at hiring someone with higher IQ because we're service and so this person is not a setter that calls to like, what could call the person was just simply texting and messaging the buyers to, hey, did you get your purchase? I gave you simple process of that, because of that good will or good karma, then those people are more likely to buy other stuff from that map. Then what she also did, because we've been running ads for so long, went back to all the old ads, the actual posts, like within the Facebook ads ID, the actual posts, because she messaged the VA, messaged every single person commenting, hey, just wondering if you're still looking for this did you get value from this did you and then from that that increased like she's making about 10k now a month in sales organically for that for an $800 person and but the reason why we had that asset she's running ads for two years right and so you should put that in 60 in the 60 to 90 days slot so coffee shop millionaire how to click bank penalizes you when you have too high of household and so they got penalized big time and all that I implemented was zendesque and an FAQ section and we dropped it down to less than 2%.
01:01:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
38 reduction in refunds by having good customer support so yours is actually proactive support rather than reactive right and in that went to there's a saying in sports that the best off best defense is a good offense you don't even need a defense, if your offense is so good that you're always on their side of the field and not on yours, right? So what you did was you had a great offense, right? You're going out so hard that you're actually converting them to the next level of sales. There doesn't even come up an issue of customer support.
01:02:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This just happens probably in the same conversation. You don't think we can add an FAQ section like in between day 30 to 60?
01:02:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think you should. I think the whole point of creating this scope is not overdoing it. This is a lot of mental work. They, oh, yeah, they zero to 30. Sorry, 30 to 60. You could be starting to do this. Yes. But you, maybe you have the VA do it. So if you do out of scope of support is outsourced VA, then you delegate the VA to start capturing frequently asked questions. As long as you're not doing it, that's okay.
01:03:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, here, start capturing.
01:03:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, 60 to 90, not 0 to 30, or I mean 30 to 60, 30 to 60 is okay, but not before that. I'd probably have that more at 60 to 90 because we don't want to overwork your brain. There's a lot of data to process in 0 to 30 and 30 to 60. Less than 30 to 60, but now 60 to 90, to me, that's optimization, which FAQs and customer support to me is in the optimization realm, but it could be considered fulfillment. So 60 to 90, I mean 30 to 60, it could be in there. It depends on what you want to do and how zealous you feel about it.
01:03:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was thinking it was my funnel. I would want to start maybe in a section.
01:03:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And I. I like the golden rule methodology of things.
01:04:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If I were doing it, if it was my business, this is what I would do. How about refine?
01:04:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So that is an ongoing process. It should always continue to be refined. And also, what I would be doing in that portion is looking at how do we use AI to improve it?
01:04:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Cool.
01:04:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And as far as you going, any services that you offer, knowing what is AI tools and staying on top of that technology to know what can be used to scrape and automate those questions, and because it has the ability to say, somebody asked this question, and this verbiage is different, but it's pretty much the same question. So I'm going to count that as a number. That didn't exist a few years ago, and it does now, so we could create. Additionally, building in here a chatbot for sales and support, 60 to 90 days, or you know now we're getting into phase two of just kind of optimizing and growing scale.
01:05:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Any eye chatbot?
01:05:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:05:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But that's out of scope of the 5000 month, isn't it?
01:05:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, so that could be the next 90 days. And you could say, now this is above and beyond creating and optimization, but this is optimized in scale. first 90 days is create, establish and grow. And second 90 days could be like grow and optimize, optimize, grow, whatever. And then I don't even know you want to put grip, but the third phase is just maintenance and scale. scaling, which seems like they're not the same thing, but when people neglect maintenance and they focus on scaling, then there's problems.
01:06:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, so we try to, day zero 30 is phase one, optimize and grow?
01:06:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nope, day, phase one is 90 days. So that's why the whole point of the long term view, like we have six to nine months. Six to nine months allows for the three phases. the first phase is just really creation. The second phase is optimization and the third phase is scaling. And the third phase is the third 90 days.
01:06:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, day 90 to like next 90 days. Yeah. Phase two.
01:07:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
01:07:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Is it you just call it optimization or scale?
01:07:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Optimizing and preparation for scale. Prepare for So the first thing that you do is look at, you know, maintaining anything from phase one, anything created in phase one. And then now you're going to look for what are...
01:07:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hold on. Let me just hit pause for second. a comment here, but it's one.
01:07:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll hear you.
01:07:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I got about 20 more minutes. But this is for them.
01:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like what you're we could so many days we'll average I'm excited because I have so much stuff in my brain that I would love to teach and love to get well to use but I won't do it by myself Maria so yeah you're capturing a lot of stuff yeah sorry yeah we can sell this as a consulting kit because everyone wants to start an agency make a current revenue can go high level like this we could totally certified people in this and sell it and we've got the notes from every call okay so phase two is we're maintaining everything that was created in in phase one including the split test process right in the customer support process but most of what phase two is it's continuing to optimize right so understanding our split test results and improving them but the other thing is before we get to scale is where have we left money on the table is there a compliment Mentory or supplementary offer we didn't put out there that we should have that we're getting the feedback from our customers Right so if somebody through the FAQ is in the customer support I said, you know what I have this knowledge this gap this gap in knowledge And it's not being addressed here. How do I get this addressed or? I want more hand-holding. How do I get more hand-holding? or Okay, well you taught me how to do all of these things, but I don't know how to outsource it You're not teaching me how to outsource it. Can you teach me how to outsource? now we create an outsourcing product. So the next 90 days is learning from our customers what we could do better and How do we increase the lifetime value of the customer and but also the average order value? You So, that's it, that's it, that's it, it's just massage everything and make it as good as we can. Phase three is scale and it's, you need to look at the pace of scale and the cost of scale. Is that your mama?
01:10:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Amanda.
01:10:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I should just cut back. Okay. Tell me about Amanda. Yes, bye. Yeah. Anyway, so I saw you smiling in the earbuds or so. Anyway. Um, so scale is first, you have to create the strategy for scale. Right. So that's a long discussion. That's not a one off conversation. That's not a one off meeting. That's a whole process. And here's why you doing everything in Trello for them is so important, is because you will have kind of an inventory of what it took to get to where you're doing and what it's taking to manage the current business, right? So you know how many people it takes to fulfill, and hopefully by phase two we've learned how to fulfill well what we're currently fulfilling. So if we were to two X thoughts or three or four X that, what would it take in fulfillment and who's running it and who's leaning it and who's managing it? So how much high-level mental power and energy and leadership is that taking? And can we do that with the existing people? Can we two X with our existing team? Can we four X with our existing team if we can, then we just go through that process. Keeping in mind and making sure that our content. I understand that you can't just go, especially with Facebook and I don't know about other platforms, but especially with Facebook, you can't just go double your ad spend and they double you get a lot of the times that backfires you immediately your ad spend and all of a sudden you're losing the leads that you get it makes zero sense, but I've seen it happen repeatedly.
01:12:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I think this one is more look at other profit sources as well.
01:12:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, but that's really to me that was happening in phase two.
01:12:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Phase two, oh, okay, but no, yeah, I mean, maybe, no, no, no, okay, so phase two, we need to profit sources.
01:12:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was thinking about this right complimentary products that were missing, but you're talking about channels.
01:12:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no hidden money. Yeah, I was thinking about complimentary products, but scale here is like expand other marketing channels.
01:12:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, add channels. Okay, got it.
01:12:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I totally agree with that.
01:12:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay. So how can we replicate our marketing across channels? You know what, if we map this out really well, and then we go get Maui or somebody to make this into a beautiful PDF or slideshows, and then you're presenting this to your clients. Oh my gosh, like a pitch deck. Girl, kind of like just close it.
01:13:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah, like, because, you know, ages ago, when I worked as a strategy, chief strategy person for the, we see what's her name, Emily Hirsch. I actually created for her because she just had a document like that. I said, you know, if you want to close more clients, because I learned that from work for the big consulting firms, we need graphics, right? So we would, I'm just showing you, we would make of these kind of sales projection graphics. See that within sense, they send conversions. And then we would make, let's see.
01:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know what I want now. What do you want? I want to work in companies like you with you. All the things that I've been doing. I want you to be the CMO. I want to be the COO. But I just want to have the teams. only want to have one or two meetings a week.
01:14:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Everybody do their stuff.
01:14:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I love using my brain.
01:14:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So I created this on paper and then I hired someone on fiber to put it in digital format. But like, so we could mimic this because it's so beautiful. Mimic this with what you just talked about. Yes. Three phases.
01:14:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, we are magic together.
01:14:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We are. thing is, he's expecting the proposal today, though. So I think I need to give it to him word format, just so he has it because I told him I'd give it to him. And he really wants to know what's out of scope. But I think I have enough from you right now, but I agree.
01:15:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think eventually we make a pitch deck like this That's what this is right.
01:15:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, this is actually the guy that does the guy her Lee So let's use the guy that on the MacGyver show. He's the writer for MacGyver. That's amazing. This guy.
01:15:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah Here's what I think I know you have to go in a few minutes if you close this guy Yes, then and I'm happy to spend any of our time during the week just helping you Mm-hmm. you don't need help But if we can speed it up so that we can get to some of this stuff together then then again I'm always looking out for me. I'll be honest But what I would love then to do is is take what's happening there because so You know how to go make all the money But what you can see is a light outline the operation and it immediately comes out of my brain like it doesn't take any time Next step, next step, next step, I can go hire the people, I can bring them in, train, insert, whatever. But anyway, if we take all of this stuff in our, in whatever free time is available, and now you've got enough money and you'll be okay, then let's go pitch a client or two max. But they got to be doing 50,000, I would rather see them doing 100,000 a month with roughly 40% profit margins, and they want a COO and a CMO who work together, who will take everything top to bottom and execute it. And we put out killer, like we just put out a few skills that show what we do, and we just wait until somebody takes us up on it, because your money's coming in enough, mine's coming in enough, and we'll wait until the perfect match comes in, and then we get to play together and build this, and then get testimonials from that. So it's a slow pace, but it means we're not For you mean or replicate to other nope, so I call it face so face three and beyond The face three and you're kind of always in face three every product or Like I don't know what you would call it offer every Product offer type Once you get to phase three, is no additional phase. That's it's to infinity because that's scale Unless base four would be selling mean exit the business.
01:18:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
mean yes, God, got Well, did you say before like what was initially face three and Replicate based on it's just scaling and until you can't scale anymore or you want to sell and exit So for for this, that's it For one product market offer type whatever that's this is it It's just continuing
01:19:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
no optimization, sell the offer, sell the business, it both they're there, they can be separate because sometimes, you know, you, you can sell something off piece by piece. So, but then, so what I would do beyond this is go, um, uh, so that's step one of getting towards the Brooke business, right? After phase three, step two, so this is not a phase, but this is, this is a step on the mission, right? Um, um, is launch the next product. And I don't know how that fits into her model, because I don't know anything about her.
01:19:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Does she have all these different types of products? Does have now and she has lot of coaches underneath her and stuff, so she has a 25 case certification, but she stopped it all that. I won't go into detail now because I think I'm ready to send this to him because I know he's expecting it. Um, I have to go for massage and
01:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like 20 minutes.
01:20:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
terrible. I know, yeah. So, so, but, um, so in scope, I can just keep us assets. creating for you assets.
01:20:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I really like bullets too.
01:20:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think bullets just help the eyes. My problem is that I don't know Google sheets that well, so you want to do bullets to ads?
01:20:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so it's just line breaks and then highlighting it. What do you mean? Let's do this under assets. Yeah, essentially. I was gonna say, if you could share it, I'll just do it for you real quick. But, um, okay.
01:20:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm happy to help. It is. Copy link.
01:20:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, um, can you do T net profit drivers? That's my main. That's what I'm always in.
01:20:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Either one without profit drivers.
01:20:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll leave them. Actually, I'll leave them both of them, but, okay.
01:21:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then I could also put the link in the chat.
01:21:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's probably fast. Then I'll go do it super quick. Okay. That way it helps with this eyeballs and, um, okay. So where are we at?
01:21:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Uh, right. Then I can see what you're doing too.
01:21:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I. Should be able to work. Okay. if that doesn't work, here's what we do. We just go up here. There.
01:21:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I am. I'm seeing what you're doing. I was just like, screw it. either take it into Canva or hire someone to fix it.
01:21:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. But so that just, and sometimes I will do things like, um, uh, like, I'm not telling you to do this for this one. But anyway, just the little bit of color pop. On things that are really important. Oh, so actually what I would do is do it right here. Oh, shoot.
01:21:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That is not a good color. Sorry.
01:21:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Amazon color. Yeah. It's just, it's. Just a little bit of yeah. Anyway.
01:22:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
01:22:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anything I can do to help energize them immediately and help them focus. And when I'm talking to them, keep them, because everybody's distracted by the phones where you're talking to them, they're looking at all these alerts and notifications or whatever. So if I want them to pay attention to the value I'm bringing and I'm trying to make a sale, or I'm trying to persuade them to say yes and do the thing they need to do, everything I can do to keep their attention focused is for their benefit, but also my clients. I won't drag people. little things to psychologically help them stay focused means that we get there going faster. because I know most entrepreneurs have ADD of some sort or another have focus attention. I'm always trying to be like focus on what I'm having to focus focus. Anyway, I know you got to go.
01:22:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I hope this is helpful. This is really helpful. So, so. the rest of document, though, we didn't finish what's out of scope, though, right?
01:23:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, anything beyond this is out of scope. So, um, like, if you want to write a brand new sales letter, are you doing it? Or are you hiring our copywriter?
01:23:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, well, in the existing funnel of specific upsell one, upsell two, yes, that's in scope.
01:23:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. that's the type of thing I'm thinking. So like you already put graphics out there, a VA is out of scope. So for like following up with customers, that's out of scope. Customer support is out of scope.
01:23:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Hiring and paying a VA. I want to customer support.
01:23:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. would include help desk, FAQs, et cetera. Chatbot, is that in scope of support or out of scope of support?
01:23:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think I can help strategize to chatbot.
01:24:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But actually creating it, I think that someone else should. So chatbot creation and then in parentheses, I will create the strategy. Somebody else must implement or execute, or that's an additional fee. So like, if you want to do it and manage it, even if you outsource it, you need to be paid for that. Yeah, most contracts are not this detailed.
01:24:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know, yeah.
01:24:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then something you might put in parentheses is to improve the beautifying, improve customer content consumption, and execution. Maybe parentheses at the end of it.
01:24:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, or should I just take that out for now? Just graphic design? Yeah, maybe he's really proud of the playbook when I
01:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's awesome.
01:25:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, that's smart.
01:25:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, I'll end up later.
01:25:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oops.
01:25:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like one idea.
01:25:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anything else on a screen?
01:25:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Well, I mean, um, weekends? Yes.
01:25:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, so like I'm not available via text.
01:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not available after this hours unless there's a fire. I always put a fire. So the only thing that, um, a fire is orders are broken and they don't work. But I would still say, um, if you want somebody to fix that type of thing, we have a developer on call.
01:25:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm not your developer. Yeah. Oh, the list is a fire.
01:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In which case you're only available for consulting, not operating or something, whatever.
01:25:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You just say unless there's a fire and then elaborate on a call what that is. Yeah, how about you say weekends? I'm not an electrified balance. So there's fire. That's fine. I think that's, um, I was going to say one more thing that I just thought of. It's important. Oh, cost of the ads.
01:26:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
01:26:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, it's the actual. That's been spent is in your account. On the credit card. I know that's very detailed, but.
01:26:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I should put my half these pink migraine glasses. I should put them over here because they really do help with I string to.
01:26:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would scope would be a brand new low ticket offer. How about that? A brand new low ticket. Well, as that would be an additional.
01:26:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I would say anything outside of what is on this document is out of scope of support.
01:27:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, that's kind of what is on, I would say, what is on this document is out of scope. Oh, sorry.
01:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You like what? What is on this document? What is on the scope of this document? Because then it's kind of like redundant.
01:27:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you think I'm sorry what is on this document? Okay.
01:27:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would make these bullets. And highlight the required 90 day contract. And I would use the brighter yellow for that one, bold bullet. Okay. Thank
01:28:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was going to take out, if you look at the biggest brands, the moans use blue because he uses blue and his branding, but I think we'll just leave it as optimizing the emotions.
01:28:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. going to do this really. What the heck?
01:28:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. I know. don't.
01:28:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's what I hate Google Docs for. Did you copy and paste anything into here?
01:28:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No.
01:28:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's weird. It's not that bad. Okay. Cool. Um, out of scope and then we'll do, you know, there we go up on do, okay.
01:28:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I say contract, but really it's not really contract to say required 90 day commitment.
01:28:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What about? Yeah. There we go. Out of scope. And I would actually make this like, well, that's harsh. Hold on. That's what I'll do. This is. That's. That's. That's. And that.
01:29:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Graphics Designer, as far as telling them what to do, because graphics designer, I'm saying the outsourcing graphic designer.
01:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Graphics creation. Because you'll direct what graphics are needed to be creative and not create them yourself.
01:29:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Director, how's that?
01:29:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.

Can you hear me?
00:00:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Shona's not here yet though.
00:00:06 - mark sweet
Yeah.
00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Everything okay?
00:00:17 - mark sweet
Yeah, in Vegas right now.
00:00:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will text her real quick and see. Oh, well I said it was little don't I see it.
00:00:34 - mark sweet
For easy like how important it is to go and meet the doctors face to face. It does take a lot of time, but especially in other states.
00:00:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:00:46 - mark sweet
Yeah, it makes a big difference because there's more and more of these California firms just like going through or doing what they're doing and just trying to separate ourselves little bit and put a case to a name and whatever. I think it spends some time with them because the people generally like me a lot once they meet me.
00:01:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've noticed.
00:01:09 - mark sweet
Yay.
00:01:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's our trauma. I admit.
00:01:20 - Chona Sweet
What? Hi.
00:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi.
00:01:23 - Chona Sweet
I was in Google. don't know what happened.
00:01:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's um Um, sometimes the the events just have it there by default. Um, if I and if I'm not careful and don't delete it.
00:01:39 - Chona Sweet
So oh, uh, yeah.
00:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've had zoom issues all day. I literally just got it installed and marking it like 601 and had to uninstall it after fighting with it. So I'm audio only today. um, yeah. Okay. Let me go to my notes real quick. Oh, it was good. I've been exhausted all week after just getting back late and then taking my daughter to seminary. then this morning, she wakes me up at 4.53 a.m.
00:02:18 - Chona Sweet (3)
she's like, mom, I'm late for seminary. And I get up and I'm like, my heart's racing and everything because I'm like, oh, I slept through my alarm. And then I look at the clock and I'm like, you don't go for an hour.
00:02:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
there was no catching up on sleep.
00:02:33 - Chona Sweet (3)
I tried to with their like little tiny windows here and there.
00:02:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm just like, yes, that's been fun. But she's doing good. So anyway, how's your charting been going?
00:02:46 - Chona Sweet (3)
It's, you know, it's still a challenge, but I feel like I'm getting better. I feel like it's really yeah. It's still a challenge.
00:02:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's a work in progress. Whoa.
00:03:00 - Chona Sweet (3)
show me explain to me what's getting better um i don't wait maybe more than two days to chart so i guess that's a like an improvement i thought you told me you were gonna do your charting at the same day yeah it was getting difficult um how many people are you seeing each day so like um yesterday it's just telemedicine but two days before it's um i have almost almost 35 and 90 i would say 80 percent of that is like new patients because of the new contract we have like influx of new patients and yeah did you just tell me you saw a 95 patients on one day no no no no I said 90, 80%, 30 plus patients, actually I feel like it's more than that I have to count because it's like 18 in the morning and I think I have almost 20 in afternoon and like 80 plus or 90% of that are new patients. So when it's like new patients I was just a lot more charting because they're new.
00:04:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what's the average length of time to chart for a new patient?
00:04:40 - Chona Sweet (3)
I honestly do not.
00:04:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like I don't really time it but that's the first thing that we need to do. And so here's what I'm to tell you, Chana. I said it in the beginning but now you're getting to the point where like we can really kind of feel it. This is tedious.
00:05:00 - Chona Sweet (3)
in the beginning, right?
00:05:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is tedious in the beginning. But if you will do the things that I ask you to do, we will get through the tedious faster than any other way. So timing yourself and observing the things I'm going to ask you to observe is adding tedious on top of tedious. But the fastest way for me to help you systemize and simplify what you're doing and to speed it up. Is to be able to understand what the baseline is first. Yeah, and I can send you notes at the end of this too.
00:05:40 - Chona Sweet (3)
Let me go make sure my note taker is working because I feel like it's definitely more work for new patients. I definitely find myself. So, you know, getting, you know, I'm trying not to, because I'm trying to, I know it's going to be all hard work. It's just that I feel, I know early on that when I get busy with the PI stuff, I know which one to cut. And I don't, and I know, when I say I have to cut means, I know what to tell Dr. E, which one I don't like.
00:06:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you mean, like between what you're doing in PI stuff?
00:06:42 - Chona Sweet (3)
No, because the PI stuff, because it's like, remember the one, two, three, I'm on number one, which is the main word. And out of the number one, there's three categories, I guess, if it says that, first it's the hottest. Hospital rounding and I haven't even get to that because I have yet to get the privilege from the hospitals So there's one the second one is the clinic work, which I Don't know I guess from the beginning. I already know that I don't like clinic Mm-hmm, but the clinic setting are like the bread and butter of a Pain clinic basically, so that's where the bulk of our patient population is and that's where the Remember if you if you remember the the contract that I was saying that he the doctor He recently acquired that's where the majority of patient will be and then the third category is the telemedicine Which is you know, just how it tells tell them medicine phone call, but it's best basically medication refill or ordering other treatments for the patients. And yeah, so the number one cat, a number two category of seeing patients in the clinic is my least favorite because I feel like it's just more work in terms of charting. Seeing patients in the clinic, it's not my favorite thing ever since I become a nurse, I don't like clinic work, maybe because of the charting and I mentioned before to you, I really don't like writing a lot, but the hospital setting is very much focused charting. I think that makes sense, oh, the patient have pain here, it should be the same, but for some reason that clinic charting has more charting and it's just annoying. However, I know that the PI or the pain or the personal injury cases are considered clinic patients, but obviously I feel that I'm putting a lot more effort on the PI clinic patients if that makes sense. Yeah. And I'm trying not to in a way because I don't want to be that person that I have to take care of the patient more because I'm getting paid more on it, you know, but I talked to Mark about this the other day and I don't know, it doesn't sit well with me, but I know it's the reality of the situation and not just me. I'm sure everyone that gets paid more on PI patients, you know, day. It kind of like I have to give a little bit more I Just work on it.
00:10:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just find myself catering to them more and Kind of don't like it in a way, but at the same time I do I the reason why I said I don't like it I want to treat everyone the same I guess that's why I'm trying to say okay so Let me ask a few questions and figuring this out will It'll take a while it'll it'll take multiple conversations, which is gonna take multiple weeks But what do you like about your job?
00:10:43 - Chona Sweet (3)
I like when Ever since I become nurse it's been typically A management, which was 11 years ago. I like that I Work as an NP, which is a different level of autonomy As compared to being an RN, a bedside nurse, I like that I can give what I think would help with the patient. I can order it right away and I can see the results right away, of like ABC type. I like that. And then lastly, I like it when a patient with, you know, the instantaneous gratification of saying thank you because it helps them. Eventually, the most difficult one is in the pain population, they're one of the most difficult ones because there's a lot of, I feel like, negotiation skills that I'm doing, you know, like, I can't give you more narcotics, but trying to convince them that narcotics is not the only treatment, there are other treatments. It's difficult, but it's fulfilling once they've Realize it themselves.
00:12:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so like what, what kind of treatment do you suggest? I'm like sure you have all kinds of different types of pain and levels and options. But what are some of the non narcotic options that you suggest?
00:12:21 - Chona Sweet (3)
So like, um, I guess I'll talk to it based on my experience. I can do things like my experience in the hospital, which is the bulk of my experience. Because I work in a hospital, you know, as a pain and P is in the instantaneous result of I can order IV tylenol and some people don't even know that exists or IV magnesium or IV vitamin C for pain. And some people would not even think that even helpful. Yeah. Um, or even can. I mean, ketamine is anesthetic, it's not narcotic. So that's why I like hospital setting a lot. It's very instantaneous that there's more access. I just realized that just now, maybe that's the reason why I like hospital setting more. But now doing the clinic setting, while I'm awaiting to work in a hospital, like doing the clinic setting, I feel like I'm limited in a way and it's geared towards more intervention type procedure, which I was not, that's a new thing for me. Anything like if the patient has back pain and they will look at the MRI and see, oh, you have stenosis, you have narrowing on the disc and that's why the PT medication doesn't work for you. So we may recommend you to have an epidural which is done by the anesthesiologist. So notice that that thought process is very much common in the clinic setting, and that also correlates with PI patients.
00:14:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and so do you imagine that there's a path where you can understand the nuance of the clinical setting and so I understand that the limitations that you have access to options in the hospital that you don't have access to in the pain clinic and when you know that something could be really helpful and it doesn't require an invasive procedure and it doesn't require a narcotic which comes with all kinds of other side effects and issues, dependencies and whatnot, that that can be frustrating. But do you feel like you can and work with the options that are there and just and feel any kind of like personal satisfaction, knowing that you're giving the options that maybe aren't the same as the hospital, but that you're giving the best that's available to them in the place that they went to.
00:15:17 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah, yeah, I do. And I know that it's temporary until I have the privilege in the hospital. And I think it's designed that way to not make us feel that, you know, like just set stationary, like, oh, we're just doing clinics every day of the week, day to day. So how it's, so I in my head, it's temporary, so I understand. And I know that I need to understand the clinic culture and setting anyways, because that's how I can succeed with my PI cases, which is this, Number two, out of the three source of income. But also, there's one thing that is new, that I haven't fully utilized by myself because I'm not an experienced on it, is I can do injections on my own too. That is intervention, but that is something that I can do, and it's exciting to explore because I've done it multiple times without the E, but I haven't done it by myself. So I almost did it by myself the other day, but Dr. E is available, so I'd rather him do it with me. Yeah, well, that's in and of itself, it's a procedure, but it's not as, I guess, it's excessive like an epidural interest, yeah.
00:16:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so what we'll do every week is try to figure out what are the, Because even in the beginning while you're still wrapping your head around everything and waiting for access and whatnot, there should be something that we can do. And even if it's just a perspective shift, like earlier in the week, we talked about writing your own story, know, that what you feel like your limitations are culturally, language, that's not permanent, you know. You, there are different things that you can do, and we talked about just the practice using, using translate tools, using chat dbt, whatever to help you overcome the language barrier. And then over time, because there's, there's only so many things you're going to have to write over time. Obviously, there's a wide variety, right? But eventually the repetition is going to kick in and you're going to know the same phrasing and you're going to know it in proper grammar and you're not going to feel embarrassed anymore, and you're not going to feel like you're less than for any reason. We know that the only way that's going to happen is over time. So we can't shortcut that per se, but we can kind of expedite it with the tools that you use. And then the other thing we can do is just you just remind yourself that your story today isn't your story next year. So and kind of looking forward to that. And a year is one of my favorite perspective tools. So it's really difficult to to map out significant change when you're evolving as a person, even more so than professionally. Sometimes professionally you can do it, but the the wow effect really doesn't happen in a month. It doesn't happen generally in a quarter in the six months, but the wow effect is almost always happening. Like I've never not had that happen with anybody I'm working with in the course of a year. You look back over a year, like, that was significant, even when it's just kind of. still subtle, you can clearly see some measuring points where this was, you know, significantly different or that was significantly different and then you can kind of add in the compounding. So one of the things I just want you to do every day is remind yourself that, first of all, define and I think I asked you in text but I'm going to ask you now as kind of write down what you want this to look like a year from now. How do you want to feel about charting? How do you want to feel about the way that you write? You know, I don't love writing. I hate it. I'm 48 years old. I'm never going to love writing it and now typing but if I could just automatically download everything I wanted to say, then I'd be happy but that's not going to happen. So anyway, you know, it doesn't mean that you're going to love it or feel like you're great at it but what we do want to do. Um, is at least not feel so much resentment or frustration about it and, um, if it's one of those things we just have to bear down, then you bear down, but there are dictation softwares.
00:20:14 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:20:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. so are you using anything to help you with that?
00:20:18 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah. So, um, Dr. E actually just called me today and say that, um, he bought a, the, the dragon for healthcare. They, that's what they like.
00:20:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:20:30 - Chona Sweet (3)
but I can't use it on the apples. So, but he, he said he got me a lots of which I'll, I'll get it tomorrow. So, I'm excited for that. I'm sure I still have to be vigilant on editing it because of my accent until it, until it adopts, I guess, to my accent, but, um, I, I, you know, I, I think what I feel to do today. I feel okay. I, I don't feel like. It just waxes and wanes how I feel on, you know, feeling quote, unquote, less than, but I'm happy with what I've been doing. I mean, it's not perfect. It's a work in progress, but I, I feel like each part of the three, the streams of income, I'm working towards like the, like, I told you the Washington, I submitted that already. So I contacted my university to submit my transcripts to Washington State, and I'm happy about that.
00:21:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
okay, that's an accomplishment. Yeah. Um, so I just did a quick Google search on how do I do new patient charting faster and I put pain clinics.
00:21:44 - Chona Sweet (3)
So the first thing I came up with is use dictation software like dragon.
00:21:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The other one it said was electronic health record can help you chart faster by automating tasks and allowing you to chart from anywhere.
00:21:58 - Chona Sweet (3)
And yeah, we can. Yeah, which is what I do that I feel like being having the capacity to chart at home It's a blessing and occurs in in a way to me because I feel like I Have this sense of okay. I finished seeing the patient boom boom boom. Maybe do a quick You know jot down a few notes on each basin and just tend the note and then chart at home So that means I'm finishing my work at home versus finishing it at work Which I think I should not dab it as a good as bad. It's just how it's just what I I'd rather be at home And chart at home be comfortable, but that means I'm bringing work home at home And sometimes I push the limit on maybe I can do it a little bit later and then yeah I'm up till 2 a.m. It's a slippery slope.
00:22:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so this is where you really want to define your values When when I talked about like writing your story what so this is this is not not. This is going to be an iterative process as well. So what I would like you to do is kind of map out your ideal week. Now, it's not going to be the same all the time. Some weeks you're going to have special events, trips, things that you want to do. Some days you might have an extra load of patience. days, know, we're women, there's an entire week that sometimes just feels terrible once a month. It's all kinds of things that can affect you and reduce your productivity, reduce your mental capacity. So you have to take that into account when we when we map out the ideal week. There are people that will call it like a perfect day exercise. There's no such thing, but the ideal week and you want to look at like what is your work day look like? When do you start? How are you starting your morning? do you want to feel in the morning? do you want to think in the morning? What do you not want to feel? And then a negative match list is really, really important because a lot of times it's easier to write the positive things by putting in the negative attributes. for me in the morning, I don't want to feel stress at all. It's bad for me physically. cortisol is dangerous. It's really difficult to capture goodness in the rest of the day and to be productive. But also the morning time and in the evening is when I'm with my girls the most. And so I don't want to spoil or even infect them with negative energy and stress. So I don't check email. I don't look at anything that could cause me stress. And also I'm most creative in the morning and late at night. So it's kind of the wee little quiet hours around the house. don't know if it has to do with timing or just has to do with around. But for me, those are the creative times. So in those times, I want to make sure that my schedule is not, I don't want to be having conversations. So I don't schedule calls until after 10 or 11 during the day because I want to do my creative organizational administrative tasks in the morning and in the evening as well. So I don't have calls during that time. So those are some of the things that I've figured out for myself in terms of types of tasks. other thing I've realized is that I have my best phone call time between 11 and 2, 10 and 1. Kind of depends on the day. But I want to help people. I have more energy during that time. My brain is functioning well at the time. And because of what my clients pay me, I want to give them my best brain for problem solving and also my best energy for other people's problems. So now you've got a different kind of schedule. don't have as much flow in that, but what you do have is what kind of home life do you want? What do you do anything in the evening that you want to protect? Is there a dinner time? Is there a snuggle time? Is there a you want to go for a walk? Is there a hanging out with friends? I'm like, whatever those things are, and maybe it's not the same every day, but whatever those are, you want to kind of plan how you do your charting and whether or not you take it home that night based off of the things that you want to do. And you also need to be aware of your discipline and your tendency to let the work creep into the most important things. So, and I'll tell you another kind of filtering process that I use to make some decisions, because generally the choice. that we make aren't between whether it's a good thing or a bad thing, which is easy, right? Because if I know it's bad, I'm not going to do it. But it's degrees. So a lot of times it's between good or better or best. But because you've only got 24 hours in the day, and you're only conscious for approximately, you know, 14 of them will say, allowing for the waking up and then going to sleep and actually being asleep. But and then there's only so much that you're not commuting and you're you only have control over what you're doing. If you say, if you give your yeses to the good things, to just good things, then you don't have yeses to give to the better things. And you don't have yes to give to the best things, because you're already committed by doing good. Well, it's not bad that you're doing good, but it's not the best. And you know, we get one life, we get one day at a time to do things. So thinking about, do you want to have your best day or You want to have a good day, obviously. Nothing wrong with a good day, right? But good days are just that and they're not necessarily inspiring or as fulfilling. So just kind of thinking about if you finish your charting at work, do you have your best chance at having the best night or a good night, you know what I mean?
00:28:27 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah, I mean our market's traveling right now, but we really are kind of like, I forgot the term used, but we like to walk at night or late at night even, like 9, 8, but I find myself charting, like if it's not here, if it's here I find myself charting. So I feel I'm not a morning person. So I like to do things in the afternoon or night time, so like the clinic work, it really starts at 9.45. So before I go to a clinic and if I have telemedicine, let's say I have 12 or 10 patients I need to call, I try to call that first while I'm at the house before I get to the clinic. And then Dr. E is like, oh it's a quick two, three minutes, four minutes phone call, but for me being new, I found myself talking to them for a longer time, that I don't think it's necessary, but I could have probably make it more necessary.
00:29:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know what you might do, I don't know if you'd be willing to do this, but call control skills are a big thing. I've talked to Mark about it because his people could use it. Most people don't have have great call control skills. Some people do, but it is a skill to kind of finesse a conversation and keep it on track, especially when you want everybody to feel good and you want to make sure that they're happy and they feel taken care of.
00:30:20 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah, they don't feel right.
00:30:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, but you can to accomplish isn't whether or not they feel rushed. It's whether or not they felt heard, seen, understood, and taken care of. The timing is not relevant to them. So if you can deliver an effective conversation where they feel heard, seen, understood, and taken care of, they don't care if it took three minutes. They just care that it was effective.
00:30:50 - Chona Sweet (3)
Does that make sense?
00:30:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, right. That's true. If you have the ability to record some of your phone calls and have Dr.
00:30:58 - Chona Sweet (3)
listen to them and say, Okay, what could I have? down to tighten this up then maybe he can give you a couple of scripting type ideas like say if this comes up this is what you should say if this comes up this is what you should say or he might say things like chon never ask this question because it's always going to lead to way too much like and if you deal with this type of person like i'm sure since he gave you that kind of time frame he's probably got some finesse type skills that he's picked up that he could give to you but he might not even know where to start unless he hears you and goes oh yeah here's where you're messing up and you could tighten this up does that make sense right it does um although i probably feel like in a way dr e is the quintessential doctors that are i don't know how to say it but i'm pretty sure i understand what you're saying so it's like uh you're doing good no changes oh how's your kid okay great so Let me first let me refill your medications. We'll talk to you next time. Okay, that's it. So And I feel like in a way, I feel I need to ask more. I am sure because I'm still, you know new to the group and I don't usually call patients on the phone and end up just prescribing them narcotics, whether they're on it for a long time or not. Like today, for example, I was talking to a cancer patient. Cancer patients were more lenient with narcotics, right? want them to be comfortable, right? I'm talking during the phone and she sounds very, very sleepy. And I can hear there's family in the background coaching her what to say. I said, I can hear your family in the background, I can talk to them if you're okay. with that. And so I ended up talking to the husband and the daughter. And I was very, very clear to have to be clear that, you know, if you think he's being very sleepy, do not give the needed narcotics is the last thing you want is for her to stop reading. And, you know, things like that, I feel like there's just no way around it. I just need to make sure that they understand what I'm trying to say. yeah. And then the other day, there's a patient like, I'm done talking to with her. And then she's like, oh, okay. And I'm kind of like saying goodbye. And she said, you're the first person I talked to today. I feel bad, you know.
00:33:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if I told her, I told her, maybe you need to go out and talk more to your neighbors.
00:33:50 - Chona Sweet (3)
I don't Yeah, those are the examples.
00:33:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, I I understand that there's a reason I'm a business for myself, and I make my own roles, because I want to do what I want to do and how I want to do it. And you have to operate according to the dictates of your own conscience, but you also have to realize where you're at and what's compatible. So one of the things is that I didn't get to a place where I could be how I wanted to be just because I wanted to be there. I had to create and I paid a price. I walked away from all income while I had four daughters to raise by myself four different times. It was terrifying. At one point I was on food stands because I just wouldn't take crap from clients that it was making me unhappy. So when I say I'll pay a price, I'll pay a price that most people would never pay in order to get what I want. But that's not, you know, but there are some things that I did tolerate because I just needed to and because of the bigger mission. required it and it made me a better person because it is important I think to learn how to work within certain parameters and not just give up or want to grenade everything. I'm really good at grenading things and just be like, you know, blow it up. So there are areas I think where you you might be like I'm I have an opportunity to serve and I feel like I need to and there might be other times where you feel that you have an opportunity to serve and comfort but this probably isn't isn't the time and isn't necessary and some of the parameters might be and it's going to be hard asking yourself so the conversation with the lady who's lonely that's a that's a whole therapy session right there it is and I feel
00:36:00 - Chona Sweet (3)
Bad and to even say goodbye to her, but I redirected it in a way that gave suggestion, maybe a need to, you know, talk to your neighbors or call your family too. He's elderly. And again, I.
00:36:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm going to pause you just for a second because it you're not going to have the answers right away, but one of the things is you can kind of develop your own toolkit sort of thing. Right. So some of these scenarios that you run into and you know, this is going to take time. If I were to handle it the way that I wanted to handle it. But if I spend that time, then I'm going to lose my time with market nights because I have to spend more time charting because I spent too much time on phone calls. Or I'm going to be impatient with somebody else who also needs me because I spent too much time doing this and that's not fair to the next person. So there's all kinds of different reasons why it's important to. within boundaries because what they want and need most is is the medical attention that you've been assigned to give them. But what you can do is come up with some kind of scripted responses for certain types of things. So if you get somebody who's just lonely and you're working in a particular area, there might be resources that you could send to them and maybe you could say, hey, maybe you could get their email. Maybe you can just send them a letter and it's scripted and you have it pre-written. Like here are some things like I really want to spend more time talking to you, but and obviously there are probably things you just shouldn't say. Maybe you shouldn't have said that, right? You have to be careful what you say to anybody. Maybe you can say, hey, I didn't know. Maybe you didn't know about these resources and maybe it's a senior center and maybe it's a visiting program where people visit the elderly or or some sort of something where you've got a list. of resources for different types of needs that people might have. Maybe you have a cancer patient-specific type of list of resources like, hey, these are the things that you need to know and understand. For example, if they're too sleepy, here's the risks of taking narcotics. So is it more important to you that they feel absolutely no pain or is it more important to you that they live? You know, because sometimes those are the choices. again, just because I'm saying this doesn't mean that's the right thing to do. In the medical world, you have to be very careful with what you do. So I would run anything that you want to do and say by Dr. E, maybe by Mark, and just make sure that what you're doing is okay. But what I would say is try to find a way to satisfy that nurturing need that you have inside of you that loves and cares for people and why you went into that.
00:39:00 - Chona Sweet (3)
probably. I think, yeah.
00:39:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but also keep it keep it in perspective that if you give everything to one person, then it takes away from the other people that you're giving to you. And so kind of balancing it out and also that you can't fix everybody's everything. Right. You're not their therapist, you're not their daughter, best friend, sister, whatever. But you can be the person that takes great care of their pain and use them the resources and make sure that they know that there are other options, actually cares. Even if they don't feel that you care, Jonah, you know if you care. So that has to be something that brings you comfort too. Because if you took this outside of the pain management, how many times have you said something to someone with good intention and care and concern and they acted like you said something bad? or tried to hurt them or didn't care about them and totally took what you said the wrong way. It happens a lot, right? Yeah. Okay, so, right, so but you wanna make this personal and bigger when it happens at work because it's work and it's important and they have needs but it doesn't change the fact that people will take things the wrong way. People will get offended. People will project their other issues onto you. You have to be able to deflect that. There's no way that you're gonna be successful in this long term and be happy if you don't learn how to compartmentalize and deflect that projection and those issues that they're just not yours and it's not heartless. I'm like, I'm a bear at heart, so.
00:40:54 - Chona Sweet (3)
Right. And I think it's just a matter of, I think I've been with him. for a month, but it it's only been the last week that I'm really on my own. Yeah. he, I don't know, I think he's just wanted to make sure that I'm supported and I said that I'm fine, but I do have, I still have, I still find it challenging or difficult to complete the charting each day. That's still, that's still an ongoing issue, but it's not a new issue for me, per se, like I tend to procrastinate, especially if it's something that I'm not, like, if I just, if I know I would, I'd like to do something, I can finish it in like a few minutes, if I really, really want to. So yeah, I'm gonna ask you a word question.
00:42:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you cold? I Get cold easy Okay, cuz you're hugging a pillow and I want to know if it's because they're colder because they're stressed out and it's a defense Oh, I know the pillow is my comfort. Yeah, it's comfort.
00:42:18 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah Here like if I don't feel I guess It's like comforting because of other issues like You know with my you know other Insecurities with my body when I know that that's what I thought that that was and I just wanted to check if it was You just happen to be cold and it was warm or because Yeah, but when you got it And the way that you hugged it it kind of was an indicator that that that you that's that's this is trustful little comfort it definitely might comfort and I Get Well, I feel like the body image issues one thing, but this work, I don't like it when there's no, I don't have the flow because I just don't have it yet, it's beyond my control. So until I have that flow, until I know exactly what I'm doing in a week or two weeks, I would feel a little uneasy about it. But I'm trying to control what I can't control, that's where I'm at. Learning things about the PI and just, I feel like I'm trying to do things like simultaneously.
00:43:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're doing a lot right now, it's a lot to learn and it's not just a lot to learn. I would imagine there's some things that go through your head like, I don't really have to do this because you don't have to do it. It's one thing when you have to make money and take care of your family. It's just not, you know what I mean? But you have bigger aspirations and you have goals about how you want to see yourself.
00:44:12 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah, I definitely, you know, that's what I did the Washington right away and, you know, Mark is helping me kind of start the conversation about having clients from different chiropractors.
00:44:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:44:28 - Chona Sweet (3)
I know it may not happen until early next year, but at least I get my licensure and then hopefully we can start. I guess Mark is saying that I need to have a different LLC for Washington. Oh, yeah. I don't know. But, you know, that's like one thing and I definitely need organization with my receive. I don't know. What I'm doing now is taking a picture and putting it under my favorite. But with the upgrade updates of the iPhone, like I cannot see the favorites right away So I Just need to be more organized with that. don't have a lot of You know expenses right now, but the other thing that comes up is you know, I I need There's a lot of good things happening in my life my career like I really need to take care of my my body myself So I start working out and the instructor that I mean them The instructor that's helping me she have a scheduling system that texts people and I know markets kind of working on that as well But a keyword is mark is working on it and not mean I feel like like you're waiting I feel like I cannot it appreciates me that I have to wait for him before I can move forward I trust what he says, but it doesn't mean it doesn't frustrate me. Also, I understand that I'm not ready to eat my own in that honor itself also frustrates me. I feel like, you know, in my head, I cannot be super ready for this. I know I just have to like learn as I go, and I'm trying my best to understand as much as I can. And I also understand that with me doing this affects marks reputation. So that worries me, makes me anxious, but that's a conversation I have within myself that, you know, I know I'm new, but I have, I'm not new to what I'm doing medically. So that's just, it's like just all those things that I... My question is to Mark about this and you know, I'm sure it's just that growing process of this having a new thing.
00:47:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's the biggest thing is the newness of adult, everything's new. relationships are new, the processes are new, the pressure is new, time management is new, the knowledge of some of the things including business and different responsibilities. That's all new. Like you're having to wrap your head around and your body and your energy and your schedule and your routine and your mindset around all of these things all at once. And that's a lot, but you can do it. And one of the things I would love for you to do is just every day tell me something that went good, tell me something that you're proud of. So like you've got the Washington stuff done, that's great. Every day, just every work day, just send me something that you're like, I'm proud of myself for this. If you're struggling to find something like that and you tell me tonight, I don't have anything I'm proud of today, I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions until we find out what your product is, because there's no way you didn't do something that each day.
00:48:17 - Chona Sweet (3)
Oh yeah, I know. I feel like I'm already proud of, I know I've been there for, I think, on my third week, I was able to get the electronic prescription that my colleagues that's been there for a while apparently took them two to three months to get while I get it in three weeks. I was proud of that. Good job. I was at the other doctor that came at the same time with me, that started at the same time with And he texted me, and he said, how are you able to get get the, the, he he he he said, He skipped fast, so I tried to help him. But anyways, I was proud of that. But I don't know if I'm too, I'm proud of how I get it, but how did you do it? So I can call them multiple times, and it's frustrating. And there's a multi-step process that they have to verify cross match with your credit score and all of that. And for some reason, they cannot verify me. So I created an email. I created a ticket. And on that ticket, I wrote a long email, basically saying that I do not understand why their company or their system cannot verify me while the other government institutions like the DEA. Okay, for the California Board of Nursing, things like that, I mentioned names, these bigger government institutions can verify me, and your system cannot.
00:50:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how hard is that?
00:50:16 - Chona Sweet (3)
Well, I was, everybody, that's my favorite thing, is just be like, listen, so yeah, I kind of basically also said that, look, the way that your system is holding me back on taking care of my patients, so yeah, I was, I was initially part of it, but then I didn't know that Dr. E's manager can also see the text, and we talked to each other and she's like, man, I saw your text, I'm like, ooh, Jordan can be spicy, and it's like, I was annoyed.
00:50:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look, first of all, you're going to be able to take care of patients better, and maybe somebody got a little fire lit under them, they probably didn't, but You know, their apathy is a plague in almost every type of business and definitely inside of government institutions and good for you standing up, but good for you articulating. And here's the thing, because you keep talking about like what you can't do with your English and grammar and whatever, but your ability to articulate the, that's a good lawyer tactic by the way. Also, that argument was indefensible because you're like, wait a minute, like all these other people can verify me. The same information is available to you, yet you can't seem to be able to do it. I'm not going to tell you your inept, but basically I showed you your inept and also it's costing my patience.
00:51:47 - Chona Sweet (3)
Girl, I was shocked when someone responded to me via email on a Saturday. I was like, I keep on responding to them back and forth, I like caring. I try it again. I keep on trying and then I kind of said it like not ultimately but kind of I said this is the third and last time I'm going to try this. If this doesn't work your system needs to override me. That's what I said and they did. So I was actually shocked it worked but yeah.
00:52:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not that's my go-to move if I have problems with people. I don't have problems with Mark because Mark is always nice and good and everything but like if I like teachers, principals, whatever somebody not handling business very well, accompanying.
00:52:37 - Chona Sweet (3)
You know what this reminds me actually and I was telling Mark this that I really wanted to become a lawyer when I was in college but anyway that's a different story.
00:52:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh it's your but it fits perfectly with what you're doing because patients need an advocate and an advocate is another word for what attorneys do right. They advocate for their clients. Well, you need to advocate for your patients and that's all that you were doing as you were advocating for all of them by being able to have this process and do that so good.
00:53:10 - Chona Sweet (3)
So that what I was doing is Dr. E would let me see all his patients either with him or by myself just until I get used to it and then he has to order the medication for me and then the patient starts to get upset at me coming back or calling to the office saying you didn't set my medication but it's not my fault it's Dr. E's fault because he doesn't do it on time. So I have to do work around on that one where I said you're here, log in and I'm gonna order this and let you look at it before I send it so that's what we've been doing and I don't like that. I want to do it my own on my own my own time.
00:53:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah. Okay, so here's what we're gonna do I need you to time five new patient charts. and five follow-up patient charts okay okay just do it as accurately as you can it just will give us a baseline to kind of figure out what it's doing and and we'll see what we get from there okay you're using drag and dictation that has to train that takes a little while there could be some shortcuts some abbreviations things like that it'll take a little while to figure out how to optimize your charting system as much as can be done and then the other thing the other assignment is I really want you to map out and and write out what does your ideal week look like are there particular times of the day or times of the day on specific days of the week where you're not charting you're not staying up late you're doing something else going for walks with Mar watching TV, resting, whatever, like whatever the things are working out.
00:55:05 - Chona Sweet (3)
You want me to think of like in the future or my ideal in the period.
00:55:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how about now like what is compatible with your life as it is right now and what you would like it to be a year from now?
00:55:22 - Chona Sweet (3)
Okay because I feel like with the Washington it's gonna be busy. That's why I mentioned once that starts and you know took off then I will have to pick and choose what I do with Dr. Lee.
00:55:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's part of the benefit of this exercise is that we compare it with what you actually have to do and what's actually in your life and go do these things match up so either you're giving up some of what you ideally want in order to do these other things and maybe it's temporarily or you optimize your day and your time a little bit better because you want to do the work and also you want to have these other particular times. So the biggest part is just consciously evaluating what has to be done, what is wanted to be done, and how the two are compatible and where the compromises have to happen if you're going to do it all and what compromises maybe you're just like I'm not I'm didn't sign up for this this is not what I want to do but where you probably will be like instead of that and that extreme like okay I want to do all of this so how do I get more done in less time how do I and then it probably will because you're taking a lot on figure out which things are best for you whether because it's more satisfying to you it earns more money, maybe it's something that you and Marc get to do more together of in the PI stuff, even though you don't like that, like there's all these different things that have to be evaluated and they all have different pros and cons.
00:57:15 - Chona Sweet (3)
Right. I think eventually when that time comes, and I call it as a retirement career, because I feel like I will always want to do something using money, is that I can travel, and Marc can never talk about this, I know that eventually our goal is to be able to travel and still make money. Yeah. Well, like if I do the telemedicine, even if I call a certain amount of patients finding that sweet number is the goal later on, that will still make me money.
00:57:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. And when there's also point where you make enough that your money can be the way that you make your money through investments and other types of things. So if you have any type of interest in that, that's, that's, and just how long do you work? Do you want to work five years, 10 years, 15 years? How much do you want to work? How much do you want to earn? How much do you want to have in your investments making money for you? not just because it's money, but because you, you had, you wanted to feel like you did something productive and meaningful. And the one thing about earning your own money is that you feel like you can put it towards the things that you want to. Like, it's a different level of satisfaction. It's not about the money per se. It's about what it unlocks for you to be able to do. It's just a resource. you have your own time. Sometimes you have your own energy, right? have, but, but money is just another currency exchange that, that we use.
00:58:53 - Chona Sweet (3)
So it's not, but anyway, not the end of, you know, it's, it's, Yeah, it's not my, I want that so I can buy or do something that I want. make the travel and make money, think that's like the best thing I have.
00:59:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, my work is portable.
00:59:14 - Chona Sweet (3)
I can take it anywhere that I want to.
00:59:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I think about money for me and like energy. I don't, I don't want a lot of things that other people do, but beauty is important to me. scenery is important to me, experiences are important to me and they energize me. And with that energy, it increases my creativity, but also I take that energy back to my people. So, you know, being poor is not compatible with serving people the way that I want to serve them because I want to be thinking low level thoughts instead of high level thoughts. You know, there's a lot to take into account anyway, but so every day. Just tell me something that you're really proud of and that that and just celebrate the wins. You can tell me the things that you're frustrating. with you but we have to end it on this is what I did good or learned this is how I grew this is like some kind of something like that every day because it will just help keep things in perspective I need you to and I will write this out map time five new patient charts and five follow-up charts yeah every day just using dragon and getting a practice at it and just kind of seeing and observing do you feel like it's getting better just kind of just kind of watching the process and seeing what you can do and that's a start like that's a lot to do for this week and then the ideal week like what does the ideal week look like now and then a year from now knowing that it's going to change knowing that we're never going to have that picture exactly but that we have the greatest chance of creating something that you're really happy with by being intense. Intentional in terms of how you create it Yeah Thank you You're welcome. Do you have any questions or anything? No, I um, I just yeah I I need to that's a very you know like actionable I said like I need to tie myself Yeah, and don't don't stress and obsess but you do wanna always push yourself like you committed to giving your best and I'll so I'll tell you one last thing real quick before we go and this is kind of my own Tool that I use and I call it an energy sandwich So if I have to do things I don't like Anything I don't like drains my energy and it makes me in a bad mood. don't like doing there's a lot of things to do But so the first thing I will do is I'll start that activity before I start that activity I'll do something that I like um It could just be snuggling with the dog. It could be talking to somebody I like. could be I had a good lunch. It could be a nap. It could be all kinds of different things. It could be good music. It could be sunshine breaks. I like to go outside and just let the sun absorb into my skin. I get the energy from it. It feels good. And then the other thing is afterwards I plan something that will boost my energy as well. doesn't have to be long. Sometimes it's just putting on headphones and listening to something that without fail I cannot be still. It makes me dance. It makes me just feel good. So I use music really strongly like that especially if I don't have a lot of time. And the other thing is if I do something that's super stressful then I need to go do a physical activity because the tension is in my muscles. So like a little walk that might be when I go to the gym depending on how much time I have. I might do some housework. Sometimes I will just pace back and forth. but it still gets all the energy out. So just kind of noticing how your activities are impacting your energy and trying to sandwich good things in between bad things, even if it's just for five minutes here and there so that you're not staying in negative energy for any excess of amount of time. Okay, I know I've talked your air off already.
01:03:25 - Chona Sweet (3)
I'll let you go. Thank you so much. don't know where Mark is but he's probably asleep now.
01:03:32 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)

01:03:33 - Chona Sweet (3)
I'm here.
01:03:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

01:03:43 - Chona Sweet (3)
I will send you an email in a few minutes with all those assignments. Okay.
01:03:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

Yeah, Mark, we have had three car wrecks in my family in three weeks. My daughter got in another wreck and this time she's born. Yeah, I don't know what the heck is going on. Wait, oh, oops, sorry in chat, plugging my computer. Still, everyone is safe, but yeah, but this is just, it's just wild. And the wreck that she got in, she did the same thing to me, the same thing to a person that this lady did to me. It's slightly different because the lady was coming in from a side road onto But it was a two-way, one-way, two-lane, one-way straight, and the lady that hit me, she crossed a solid light wind without just even checking, like, she just immediately crossed lanes. My daughter, she didn't do that, but I think the kid behind her was speeding anyway. I think she's got an issue with blind spots, and I got to figure out and teach her how to use her mirrors better, because both of the accidents happened, because she didn't see what was there, but she thinks that she was looking, so anyway. Kids are something. There's our Daniel son. Remember we're talking again about goals and just kind of revisiting where you want to go, what we're working on, what we're building towards, so that we more backwards from that was what we were talking about last week. Let's go over just the usual beginning leads everything. Man, valiant surpassing Walker. That was fascinating to me, by the way. I know they had done it by last week, but to be this late in the month, and for them to have 13, it's still not to me an established pattern of we can count on this, but because it's been progressively moving up, I'm finding this quite fascinating and wondering where it can go. Happy Monday. Try to make it happy Monday. Can you hear us, Dan? Hello.
00:02:58 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm here.
00:02:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you not hear me? and now.
00:03:01 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, I'm very vocal, as you can see, all right. I'm my ads, certainly leads.
00:03:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What we're about to say, Mark?
00:03:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's Monday. That's what we're about to say.
00:03:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Should we, should we be having called on Monday?
00:03:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Come on, fellas. Yes. Top of the key.
00:03:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's go.
00:03:27 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's my fourth meeting.
00:03:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Top of the key. What do you play point guard?
00:03:31 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I don't play basketball at all. I just use I use sports terms as if I know what they mean. You're welcome.
00:03:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I did. And I was point guard to that.
00:03:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I don't.
00:03:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, focusing on Mark because Mark is the man of the hour. I just I just keep thinking to how crazy it is, how long the list of lead sources are eight months ago. I know that's great because that here's here's that thing. Nobody is killing it in terms of I mean valiant in terms of what it has been before, but if we didn't have all of these different sources this month would look really different. Let's see, Arizona, California, 6, Missouri, 13, New Mexico. That's the other thing. That's been trending up. We've been watching it. I wonder, go and nullitify what the highest month we've had for New Mexico because we're definitely getting there.
00:04:33 - mark sweet (3)
We're showing over 10 a month. We're showing up 10 a month now. Over 10 in New Mexico every month, which I think is pretty solid.
00:04:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, which definitely supports the strategy of expanding into different states is just a powerful lever. The two, the three, I would say. So in the beginning, we didn't even know what the lever is. were really just we just went out leads, which was an educated thing. But gathering the numbers and everything and digging into it. But now I think we're really clearly is, the leverage is states, attorney fees, not attorney fees, but the wages along with optimizing their processes, which were also working on. So I guess it's four, and then intake, which intake was established pretty early on that there's just not one, enough oversight, which is the big game, and two, because there's not enough oversight, enough, not enough management, finessing, whatever which we're working on. By the way, how's the intake script going?
00:05:55 - mark sweet (3)
You guys have a decent copy of it. So we're working off that for right now. want to see would you just have what we've got a moment?
00:06:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, that's kind of what I mean is any observance in how it's working.
00:06:08 - mark sweet (3)
I think it's too soon to be honest with you.
00:06:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK.
00:06:17 - mark sweet (3)
We've had two interviews for other potential intake managers, neither of were particularly great. So I'm going to keep trying to find someone that will come in and guess the next level.
00:06:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. I'm just typing in the notes. Are you trying to hire anybody else?
00:06:57 - mark sweet (3)
know you always have ads out. In primary assistance, if anything at this point, it's always good to have an extra one or two people come and go.
00:07:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um.
00:07:20 - mark sweet (3)
We'll just keep our eyes out for anything. Obviously, if we find someone good, we'll find this platform.
00:07:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And I was messaging you about, um. Uh, Patrick's will email you about what Patrick sent to me. And I just think that. Getting more information. Um, whether we use it on a, on a Monday call, I don't know, you know, much time that you have, but I'd be willing to have a different call at least once a Specifically what I'm, what I'm getting back from the attorneys so that we can dig into that deeply, but that's. not really something you need to bug Dan with. And we already have a lot that we go over on Monday calls.
00:08:08 - mark sweet (3)
So do you have one in on is how we can make Dan make a valley.
00:08:14 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Because we're working on it.
00:08:16 - mark sweet (3)
Double that that'd be super cool. And then Walker I wouldn't need anywhere as much. And I'm going to know it's just a weird month for Monkey. And obviously when this month ends give is what we sign this month.
00:08:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You totally dodged my question though.
00:08:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Sorry.
00:08:36 - mark sweet (3)
Can you afterwards is a short answer? Yes we want some of that to what it's generally speaking.
00:08:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Then I will plan for that because I and that will be a super freaking long day. But okay.
00:08:48 - mark sweet (3)
A different day if you want. Thursdays are usually okay as well.
00:08:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay that would actually work. So let me just send that not to myself because I don't I don't think I'll forget but. Thank you because I think that that would really be helpful. mean, I don't think we're wasting time, but I want to make the most amount of time. And there's so much more to wrap my head around. So I want to, I'll get there faster with a little bit more help from you. And that's what I was hoping for.
00:09:19 - mark sweet (3)
So thank you. Do you have a question with Dan while we're on here? So in lead flow, we got one this morning at like 10 30, that like absurdly send a new lead for Jose. But I have no idea where that lead is or what that lead is or anything else. Can you help me out a little bit on that or that's just like where it is where in lead flow? So I see lead flow in, it was a, you know, new record quest lead. I don't see an email and I don't necessarily see it in Lidify anymore. So my question is, where is that lead?
00:10:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
You don't see it in Lee Flowey at all, you're at all?
00:10:03 - mark sweet (3)
Lee Flowey just says new rep request lead, and I see it David Williams. That's after I click to look at it a little more. Yeah.
00:10:40 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So that tag in Lee Flowey is to put him into that automation, then we don't do anything with them in Lee Flowey. We're just sending them to Jose for now. And then if he wants us to build automations and stuff, we're going to where I told him, I said, man, we can do all kinds of stuff. We're just going to start with sending you these people.
00:11:04 - mark sweet (3)
But he's a little funny gathering any information other than they're looking for new representation, because it's the only thing that came over. And usually they get like some basics of how the motion happened.
00:11:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, usually, well, we've never gotten one of these. So, look at their sheep. Just because a little kick off and we're going to like, when it's working stuff. Yeah, they took out the leaves from. Oh, let me ask Eric.
00:11:50 - mark sweet (3)
They definitely think we'll pick up a few with this.
00:11:56 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. I just asked Eric, it probably doesn't, he probably just isn't populating it, or it doesn't, and then we'll just have in any modify which you're sending us.
00:12:28 - mark sweet (3)
Where did it wouldn't?
00:12:31 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm almost positive it does, because this is one of the questions on their form, so every lead we get from them right now is them saying, no, I don't have an attorney. Right. So this is the right. So it's it's got to be, but I just don't know. These are different, right? So we set up a different totally different webhooks. So it's a totally different zap and all that stuff.
00:12:53 - mark sweet (3)
Got it.
00:12:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, totally for that. Oh, Eric is just saying it's. Yeah, no, it's not populating. He said it does, but it's not populating, so I don't really want to fix it.
00:13:09 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:13:11 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
All right, yeah, done.
00:13:14 - mark sweet (3)
Cool.
00:13:15 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Or soon to be done.
00:13:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
About the valiant stuff. I'm just curious, because I can't, I don't need to be able to wrap my mind around it. So you can just tell me, don't worry about it. But how much do you think you understand about his process, like, I guess, I'm just trying to figure out, like, what are the odds that you think that we could get those kind of results at some point and be able to apply that to other states?
00:13:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Just look at the spread of what's happening across states and then look at the population that's what you're about.
00:13:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You, you doing it though.
00:14:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I know what keywords is running, I don't know that you'll get any more or less by having essentially a competitor going for the same keywords, but if you look at, if you look at his results, you can say, like, I don't know if he is running in California, But if he's not, the question I have, which we're never going to know the answer to because he's not going to let me in his ad account, is he running the ads correctly, right? Could he be running them better? I don't know. But I know what keywords he's running. So I have an average chicken DJ or like fixing the site because I've used the site in like a year. So I sent that, I asked them to fix it and they're fixing it and then I can go run ads through the site that I have. But it's... What he is doing specifically is not scalable, right? It's like, I mean, that sort of stab words in general, right? if the keyword you're working with is, is finite, right? So, and this is just a very finite keyword. So it's not like he's probably not missing out on a lot of clicks, I suppose it could be. But once I start running those same keywords and then seeing what is the real impressions, right? So I can see what he's doing, but I don't trust the numbers that I'm seeing. But we could take, well, don't know if I can do this, I should see if I can do this. Since I know where the leads are, I wonder if I can get the search impression data for, I don't think I can.
00:15:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you go to similar web and get data on that? On what he's doing? No.
00:15:51 - mark sweet (3)
You didn't ask him for the search impression data.
00:15:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I mean, you're paying. I mean, I'll just get it. It doesn't, I'll just get it by running out. I mean, that's the ultimate. Because then there's also the idea that if he's not running the ads directly, then the impressions are actually wrong, right? then we also know that his other data is wrong, right? He has these crazy numbers. like, bro, no, that's not right. But so if I just go running the same state to him, the first thing is, does it get more leads, period? And then you can dig into, well, what's happening as far as impressions and yadda yadda yadda. But the four keywords that he's running are very, very low volume, unless you go to a bigger state, Texas, California, New York, Florida, right, then it's going to be, it's going to be driven by a population.
00:16:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then you can't be actively working on a
00:17:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
right now because we're waiting for the website. Is that right? Yeah, the site's up.
00:17:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And do we have an ETA on that?
00:17:09 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I do not. sent it to states.
00:17:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And when the site is up, then how long would it take for you to just get started and start running ads? it would probably take a few more weeks for new data.
00:17:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, it would take like an hour to run ads and then data will start coming in two hours later. And then you can extrapolate out after, know, a couple of days, you can extrapolate out like this less than a week, right? You'd say, this is the impressions per day, right? It's not like Facebook, right? It's like they're either happening or they're not. People are searching it or not. it's not going to vary too much. This keyword is not going to be like, oh, it's super hot on Mondays. If you don't need three Mondays, I mean, if you want really believable data, you would say, hey, and I always say this, it's like you need three Mondays because Mondays are always the highest traffic day, no matter what. But you'd have some idea of the general volume at a state level, right? So there will be running in separate states. You'd have a general idea of what the impression volume is or is going to be.
00:18:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What website is this that they're that you're anyone?
00:18:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Car accidents, settlement quote.
00:18:42 - mark sweet (3)
What's the chances? Cannibalizes to some level what Devon's doing.
00:18:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Cannibalizes as in reduces the overall volume of leads?
00:18:53 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:18:56 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I would say unlikely. More likely. would be duplicate leads, and then extra leads, right, where, or you'd get the same volume of leads, but then split across two sources. So you're going to get, it would probably be like duplicate, then same volume, but split, and then the third outcome is you get more leads because, let's say, right, we'll also get like the click-through rate, right? So a basic click-through rate right, like if I get a 20% click-through rate, well, he could be getting a 20% click-through rate, but I can start to kind of guess what his is doing based on what we see as far as the leads go, right, if they stay the same, and I'm getting a 20% click-through rate, then he probably is. If I, if we get more leads and I'm getting a 20% click-through rate, then maybe he's not in.
00:20:01 - mark sweet (3)
It won't do that.
00:20:03 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That's a myth. Right? the idea that the auction or whatever, it's like, the way that I run ads, I don't spend money to get the clicks. I try to get a better ad placement based on the ad, the website, right, using sort of the triad is relevance of keyword to add to landing page. Right? So if you get, he definitely doesn't have that because he's like sending all of them to the homepage in pretty sure. So it's not going to drive up his, I'm not going to just like get all the leads. I'm just going to run the keywords and try to get leads and ideally get leads for as little as possible. We also know what his cost per lead is, right? So I can then all, I can maybe sort of figure out other stuff, like fill in the blanks by, they're no longer blanks. because I'm filling it in saying, well, it's likely this, or this is the number that I'm seeing. So then this is probably what's happening. Or, you know, I get a lead and then this is my hospital, then you have a direct one-to-one comparison.
00:21:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, okay. Well, and even if it did happen, the way that it would happen would be the only leads to Dan God are the same leads that he got. But if that's the case, one Dan figured it out, so he just stops running in the same place that he's running and puts it somewhere else. And we stop that bleeding and duplication. But it would still be basically in that sense, instead of thinking it as paying for duplicate leads, you would think of it as paying for validation that this is the strategy that works. now, we know it and there's no longer a veil because you've got the inside person working for you that you can then go apply to all the other states.
00:22:06 - mark sweet (3)
Okay, because yeah, I mean, look, the more we get away from the vendors that are off, going to be and you see having 10 vendors is left right and having to do.
00:22:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sure. I think somebody might have brought that up several times when they said, go look for more vendors and make that a regular habit.
00:22:25 - mark sweet (3)
No, it's a very, it's a very twenty twenty four thought.
00:22:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If I could stop both of you.
00:22:36 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It was one of the first things I said when I looked at his needs, I was like, oh, you're getting 70% of your leads of this one vendor alert alert alert alert. And now they're and now they're in the crapper. So it all worked out.
00:22:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And now it's, I mean, it's pretty much the end of the month, but 81 incidents, people's not bad.
00:23:00 - mark sweet (3)
Okay, so Well, three more days. We'll probably. High 80s, maybe 90 lucky.
00:23:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice. Do we want to talk about we did all any more before we get into. Just some gold stuff that I was talking about.
00:23:20 - mark sweet (3)
Um, so he's hot to hop. And see what the hell. Blue Bay coming up.
00:23:26 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Are they over?
00:23:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Who is that?
00:23:30 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I thought they were ending like, oh, it's next month.
00:23:33 - mark sweet (3)
Next month. Soon, but not for you.
00:23:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is he the? know I've heard that name before, but I don't know who it really is.
00:23:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Link. They're a link vendor. They're SEO company, but they're just doing link building. God only knows what they're doing actually.
00:23:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you need to talk to them about what.
00:23:56 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
What they're doing money. Okay.
00:24:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
with his money. Okay, got it. All right, anything else?
00:24:10 - mark sweet (3)
We moved America a little bit to have her do more stuff with reaching out with the doctors.
00:24:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, good.
00:24:17 - mark sweet (3)
Try and get that up. So we're just kind of seeing all the doctors that we work with, finding out their t-shirt sizes and everything else, setting out swag boxes to each of them. It's been a little bit. Then she's following up and ordering lunch every time we pay in full, but that bill's starting to get a little bit high. That's okay. It's it's generating cases. So that's fine. So we're moving in that direction, which we should continue to then start seeing the doctor referrals go back up a little bit more. So I'd really like that to be 10 15 a month. Yeah, especially given that we're paying these doctors in full and everything else. Missouri, we will start getting referrals. Again, that was kind of the promise if you Well, for us going into that state and so we sent 11 people, I know it's only like since it needs to be, there was 11 people in total that were sent out to doctors. So I'd like Dr. Bell to know how many of us teach doctors, client names obviously, so you can start nudging on them to train and also to start sending us back the cases. So sorry to start going that direction, so that's what we're doing in our part. I need them to do their part.
00:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And since you already have all this stuff in Letify, are there reports where you can track that? Because we talked about it last week, but it wasn't super clear like how to easily look at number one, who you're, and we did see it. Oh, there's a honeymoon, sorry. I'm focusing on, I'm sorry. When was in Arizona, I was sitting outside in a hummingbird. just came and there were no flowers or anything around me and it just flew right in front of me and just stayed there for about 30 seconds just looking at me. was the weirdest thing in school. Anyway, okay, doctors, like what are the most ranked by how many cases they sent you and vice versa, how many cases you sent the doctors and what that reciprocity looks like with them. Because then we can also dig further in and kind of profile what does that look like? Is there a personality that sends you more stuff? Is there is it location and volume of their business? Is it what you know about how many other lawyers they're working with? There's a lot that we could dig into to profile the process of what makes a doctor referral relationship and kind of massage that. mean, there's the general Oh, things that we know about psychology is if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours, AKA swag boxes, painful lunch, things like that. But there's going to be more to it. Like when you connect with somebody, well, they're going to be more inclined to want to send you stuff, just be like, marks my guy kind of thing. You have stuff like that. Can you say that that works out well for you? Is it the quality of the connections that you have versus the quality of their business or the volume of their business or the quality of what you give them has some kind of monetary value. Since that is such a big lever in your business, like we together here haven't really dug into that, but I know that you think about it, but I don't know that you think about it to that extent. that is definitely especially with your personality that. That may or may not, you know, make an impact because maybe there's hands tied. don't know. But anyway, I think that that's something we could spend a little bit more time and dig into more and figure out if there's a way to make that even more effective, less with the volume, more with the quality of the relationships, strategically with doctors who have higher volume. Or offices that have higher volume with a doctor in an office that has higher volume, who might just nudge his coworkers and be like, this is the guy, you know, we'll get paid full amount. Our people will get taken care of quickly. His people are going to make sure that they're taken care of and that, you know, they're actually cared for. They're going to follow up with them quickly. That type of thing, what are the doctors that you work with that care about their clients and their experience, know, from the beginning to the end, as well as the money, but either almost equally with the money they care about the clients or you know something like that. Yeah, I said a lot, but what do you think?
00:29:12 - mark sweet (3)
it's not, um, there's no straightforward answer to a lot of this. There's a lot of firms that look for like one to one or I said you two I get one back and we're not anywhere near those levels. So I know we've got more room to work on these things. know, I understand the doctors have other mouths to feed as well. So we've got to be aware of that, of course, but it comes down to, like you said, the relationship and also just being top of mind that's more than anything else.
00:29:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you know how some days you'll just be thinking about something. Usually it's like the middle of the night and then you come back to us the next day with this full report of you were thinking about something and you dug into it. I love it if it would be this one. If you you just happen to think and maybe subconscious being what it is, you'll think about this and think about maybe somebody that might stand out to you and you can go get the data to verify it, that gives you maybe their higher value cases, more amount of cases. But if this is something you ever just think about wanting to dig into yourself and start kind of profiling the doctors so that we can get a little bit of traction into what we can do to improve it, that would be great. Because there's just no way you don't uncover something of, oh, this is a little bit, this tends to be a little bit more value for us. Like it can't just be random in what we get from the people that we're working with. That wouldn't make sense to me. It could be wrong, but. That's either of you have to be okay, potentially cutting off some of these doctors and sending somewhere else For sure, but it all starts with what is your awareness of them in the first place? Your cases was that less and less is less involved with the cases Yeah, so that's the other thing and something that I was thinking about is how kind of hands-off you are Which leads us back to the conversation of what kind of business are you trying to build now?
00:31:34 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And the goal setting so let's talk about that then for the rest of the let's talk about something else now sorry So this is hilarious So this morning so I updated that certainly that leads on Friday and we're sort of working on making this a little easier and I'm trying to get Isaac to help them too, but I've seen this before and all this time I know that the step waiting for docs exists but I had never seen a record collective as that so I told for them I told I use one of their updates right and in my head I'm like oh waiting for docs must mean that they're waiting for the insurance to be real like what is waiting for docs they can be a couple of things either we're waiting for like proper damage photos to see if it's case you want to take um we're waiting for insurance information police report or if we're trying to sub in we may be asking for like the previous file so we're waiting for some sort of document before we can move forward and decide whether we're going to take it or not okay so I said to this dude uh hey they're waiting for docs um I think it's the insurance thing and he's like hey yeah he's like this is what other firms are doing like if they if it's that close they're just signing the them and then they're dropping them after. And I was like, I don't know if Mark will do that. Dude, two for two. Well, both of these firms, both of these side with someone else, I'm like, one of the odds, I guess they're pretty coming. But now there's lot of firms that are these good cases.
00:33:18 - mark sweet (3)
We don't know. More often than not, they're not. But every now and then there's a diamond in the row. Oh, that's painful. And so that's why they sign them all because, you know, the one out of a hundred that turns into something good.
00:33:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Has anybody ever done the math on that diamond in the rough and whether or not that's even reversible?
00:33:37 - mark sweet (3)
There's no way to really know because we don't sign the case, we have no idea how it really ends.
00:33:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, let me answer this. It's, it seems like you, like you guys, again, I've never seen it. I have all the leads. I've looked at hundreds and hundreds and hundreds. I've never seen someone mark that. I just knew it existed.
00:33:59 - mark sweet (3)
So.
00:34:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's is your use of that is that I mean is that an internal signal that you're like this has got to be pretty close because We didn't turn them down. So like it's not sign everybody. It's like this is borderline Like maybe we should sign these ones because we're we're so close Maybe we should sign those a drop them not just sign them when they comes in the door What's it there's 12 in the waiting for doc status right now? Yep, that's it. We should look at it.
00:34:33 - mark sweet (3)
Look at this So like I'm looking at one. It's really first. It's a dog bite We're waiting to find out about home insurance because just taking a drop me just it's a waste of everyone's time Well, mean it's dog bite. Yeah Um, why would you even take a case like that? Well Yeah, okay, and they say they know who the homeowner isn't everything else Okay, then give us that information, but like, if you don't, then it's kind of hard. John Cuevas, this one's relatively new. waiting for PD photos because he doesn't know why she was parked. And then he said he was struck on the rear bumper, but it's a drivable car. So I don't know if there's a case here or not without seeing the photos.
00:35:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. So it's almost like there's got to be, so the question then is, are there ones that you're like, oh, is so like, if they turn this one thing in, this is for sure a good case.
00:35:36 - mark sweet (3)
Like that one kind of on its face, you're like, this is going to, this is going to fly, but yeah, we'll see what it take way more risk when it's like a larger injury case, right? But when it's like this, with the tissue case, I don't want to take a case or sending it to a doctor and then we find out the property damage is garbage. And then you've done all that. I dropped it. The doctor's pissed off. This the one Michael Ester, he says he has full coverage. Okay, I want to see that you have because the other car doesn't have any insurance. I don't want to sign up. just the drop in.
00:36:09 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So they don't have access to their insurance cards. Like, well, I guess that makes sense.
00:36:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Have you been like 12 years since I have, but have you ever read a book called E-Mits? No, or a classic book called Built to Sell.
00:36:30 - mark sweet (3)
You got me rebuilt to sell.
00:36:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, in correlation with E-Mits, which actually is updated, called E-Mits Revisited. It's very different. Built to sell by itself. Not so much, but it gets into the nitty gritty of what E-Mits lays down in broader framework. But I would like you to read it, the latest version. And basically, this is going to sound oversimplified, and you may want to push back on it, but I'd like you that suspends your doubts for bit. But the premise is, there's a few things. mean, they talk about org charts, I think, in there and the maturity of companies and how they get there is by strategy, planning, and specificity. And one of the topics, the thing that made me think about it, is what are your menu items, basically? Like, you can't go to McDonald's in order of filet mignon because even if somebody let you do it and they went to the store and they got a filet mignon on the chart to prepare it, first of all, it's inefficient. Second of all, they're not going to be good at it. Third, you're not going to want to come back. Fourth, the repetition of whatever you create and provide increases your efficacy at creating and providing that thing. So there's a potential that, I brought it up before and you said that that's not practical, but we don't have the data that says that. and there have been a few times where something you said was one particular way and then we dug into the numbers and lo and behold, it contradicted what you originally thought, that there may actually be a system and a strategy to the most leverageable cases rather than a catch-all of we need to take all the business because that's the only way we can catch the big winners and the big winners are what save us at the end of the day, whereas optimization may actually be the thing that not only saves you but puts you where you want to be at the end of the day, which is the most likely thing by the way. So I would like you to read that book and just see if you have any thoughts and really, really, really try to suspend any negative thoughts about why it can't work because you could be right and that's okay and those thoughts will happily come back in as soon as you let the door back in. What we need is what are the new thoughts that we haven't had, what is the new understanding that is equating us, keeping us from getting to that thing that you're trying to get to, that for sure, that's how growth happens. We learn the new thing, we do the new thing, and then we finally get to that. But if you want to be something different, you have to do something different, that kind of premise. So anyway, and it may give you some thought as to what you do want to build, which is still the conversation I would like to have. But now that we've got 20 minutes left, so Dan, don't throw a rinse in it.
00:39:31 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm just trying to optimize things.
00:39:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay. Anyway, would you please read that book?
00:39:41 - mark sweet (3)
Yes, ma'am.
00:39:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. Okay, now, and this is the ongoing conversation that I'm going to say that we should at least touch on it every six months, because at the very least once a year, but it really should be more like every six months, it just kind of recalibrate. what we're working on, but you've gone through a lot on a personal level in terms of growth, especially this last year, that at the you being the visionary who you are as a person, most definitely impacts the vision that you personally have and your business is going to follow that. So have you thought about lately in depth what your life looks like three years from now, five years from now? And I would love it if you would be as detailed about that as possible, whatever you're willing to share, not just on a professional level, but what does your day-to-day life look like? How are you feeling? Who are you with? What are you doing personally and professionally?
00:41:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
point.
00:41:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, the perfect day exercise, but it's not a but it's not the perfect day. It's more like the average week and the overall thing because I don't days are too different. They vary. And there are seasons, for example, you know, in the summer, my summer days are very much different than my fall days than my winter days and my spring days because of kids but also because of the weather. Like, so, you know, people take vacations specifically during certain types of seasons and it's not the same for all people, holidays, family trips, things like that. So I don't do the perfect day exercise, but there are certain elements that exist in your average day, like how much time that you're working, what kind of people you have in it, how you feel, are you doing social activities. is are you exercising? How much is your business working or making? What states are you operating? And how many more people do you have? Are you selling it? Are you not selling it? Are you are you working towards fatherhood? Are you working towards spending more time traveling? Like all these different things have a huge impact on the amount of time and energy that we devote to the business the quality of time and energy that we devote to the business and how much the business can give or take from all the other things that we're doing. So if we're not looking at the person as well as the business then we're setting ourselves up for some kind of failure because if they're not engineered to be complementary to each other one will take from the other. Yes. So what have you been thinking about?
00:43:00 - mark sweet (3)
probably just don't know what I want in that regard.
00:43:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In what regard?
00:43:04 - mark sweet (3)
Like what I like, do you like your side, I I literally don't know. I enjoy what I do on a day-to-day basis. Yeah, there's two days and bad days, of course, as anything, but you know, I'm excited on where we're going, but are we going to be in 15 states, right, in three or five years? I don't think so, but I didn't get really in a day-to-day.
00:43:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is your purpose in life?
00:43:37 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, that's a good question.
00:43:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much more time are you willing to spend with me?
00:43:49 - mark sweet (3)
Uh-oh, 16 minutes. Oh, bah, bah, bah. I don't mean today.
00:43:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, general, do you want to have... specificity in your goals and what you want out of life or do you want to keep meandering? How's that working out for you? And I said, you need to start practice. That is not a judgmental start. Like that might sound like it. I get what you're saying.
00:44:15 - mark sweet (3)
Like so far, it's honestly, it's a new challenge and generally speaking, I I think I understand where goals are, you know, obviously it's around profitable company to expand within reason and to have some balance. But, you know, as we've talked about before, I like working like my dream goal is not to sit on the beach and sit martinis like that's not my dream goal.
00:44:45 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So you can't say what it is, though. You could say what it's not, which is good.
00:44:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's almost always the start is what it's not.
00:44:55 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. So what are the things working on vacations for you? two weeks, you know, this place doesn't fall apart. It's fine. So I can go and take time and do whatever I want to do. you go and, you know, travel and have fun if I want it. Or, you know, as involved as I want to do, not handling day to day cases really anymore. So that obviously takes off the gigantic stress and, you know, being tied to the desk.
00:45:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Are you done with that other coach?
00:45:24 - mark sweet (3)
Dude, what happened with that guy? I got two more sessions.
00:45:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got you. That's the therapist one? Yeah. Yeah.
00:45:34 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:45:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it's helpful. Yes. Yeah. So. You know, One of those things.
00:45:42 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
things. Is kind of thing tripling your business?
00:45:45 - mark sweet (3)
Um, we'll see. I mean, definitely making better connections with people. So that's good. I cannot tell you how many random people just fall off inside, like, seem happy, which is.
00:45:57 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yes. Oh, God, you must be, must be jarring for you.
00:46:00 - mark sweet (3)
Um, you'll know like we're at like a restaurant this the chef like walk by he's like, I just want to let you know like you seem, you know, like a really happy person.
00:46:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
She's like, what? Really?
00:46:10 - mark sweet (3)
Someone I've never met before.
00:46:12 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Super weird. Mark, are you glowing?
00:46:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there a glow? Well, I haven't called you here for a long time and I've talked about your energy being much better.
00:46:24 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, no. And, you know, some of the stuff makes a lot of sense, um, where people come with negative emotion, however you want to take that, you know, it's them coming from a place of fear. so understanding where that fear lies that are helps you figure out what the main issue is for lack of better term, which is about things that did dig into it.
00:46:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and there's only so much conversation that you can cover in one hour a week anyway. So just being able to spend more time on a personal stuff is going to be helpful.
00:46:54 - mark sweet (3)
So. no, it's, it's really good. Um, you know, I can live that making sure you're not gossiping. But other people yourself, you really are.
00:47:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We've had that conversation. Remember the issues that you and Mary used to have in the whole office used to have, and part of that was talking about people behind their back. Yep. Yep.
00:47:14 - mark sweet (3)
That's the cancer.
00:47:16 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No drama role.
00:47:17 - mark sweet (3)
Big fab. No drama llamas.
00:47:20 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:47:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait. Why? got to be a mama's.
00:47:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Lama llama llama llama. No rhymes with mama. It's a book.
00:47:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I see. I see how it is up in here. Okay.
00:47:37 - mark sweet (3)
That's just been good.
00:47:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we're going to go. So one of the goals is you're not retired.
00:47:45 - mark sweet (3)
Time to take on less is the other thing which I'm sure you would definitely enjoy.
00:47:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yes, but the thing that I am concerned about and kind of increasingly so because you have two goals that are at odds with each other is. Basically. not showing up to work, but then you want to grow the business and who's there to manage it and grow it. When Mary's not in the office, you're not in the office and that math doesn't add up to me. So that's part of this questioning too. There's only so much optimization you can do without present leadership.
00:48:24 - mark sweet (3)
Of course. Well, Mary will be back in August.
00:48:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In the office?
00:48:30 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:48:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How does she feel? you still refer to her as your right hand? Does she feel like you've empowered her to be that now?
00:48:45 - mark sweet (3)
I would hope so at this point, you know, give her a lot of deference and looper and all, you know, everything that's related to what she does.
00:48:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Will you ask her? Yes, okay. Will you remember to ask her or do I need to say?
00:49:06 - mark sweet (3)
can ask her right now.
00:49:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you want. Yeah.
00:49:09 - mark sweet (3)
Okay. You want me to do. still feel like you're right hand person?
00:49:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or what do you want to ask specifically? So.
00:49:16 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. Right.
00:49:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
At one point we had a conversation and. You said I always referred to you as your right hand, but you felt like I didn't. Treat you like that and that I undermined you. How would you describe that now? Open ended please like that. How would you describe it now?
00:49:42 - mark sweet (3)
Okay.
00:49:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so that's good. Um, but, but this would be the thing. There's so much to it and that that's the other part like lately we spent about half an hour on. And, um, at the very least on lead to things like that, which is an important part of it, but, but for the things that I do, managing overall company structure, business growth, things like that, working with you as the CEO, like a dance time, we spend probably half of it, just talking about, well, it depends on what it is, what week it is, whatever. Yeah, yeah, um, but, but I'm able to go there, depending on whatever happens, and this, this three way version we have is the hybrid, and there's a lot of stuff I want to get to that there's, there's not enough time to get to. And especially where we're at right now, having systems for, we've got some good clear data. Anyway, I just feel like there's not enough time to really dig into some of the things that will work. will make the biggest difference like this and it really stretches out the runway for what kind of growth can happen. But I think that more is possible because you're primed for it now. You know the need for the numbers. We have a system for the numbers. There's more knowledge about your team. We've improved the processes. But I just don't think there's enough time really to dig into it and put a really solid framework on what's happening and there's constantly, you know, in the office, very having babies is what it is. You can't change that, right? But I really am concerned about the goal of wanting to grow and optimize the business and not having a physical presence in it and no one who is really looking at optimizing the business being in there doing it either. The reality is that It just doesn't seem like those goals are very compatible and I want to, we don't really talk about that, so I think that that's something that needs to be addressed. Now, if you're like, let's just have the best business that we can have while I'm not in the office a lot and just make this work as best as it can, then that's a goal. And it's something that that we're doing, but it doesn't feel like that's really what the goal is.
00:52:36 - mark sweet (3)
It's still to give a large f**k you to everyone else, so yeah.
00:52:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so that that's a very specific thing. Yeah. What does that look like?
00:52:48 - mark sweet (3)
Large middle fingers. Like the New Mexico thing. I don't know if I told you. We got something done by case in New Mexico and the lawyer decided to file a lawsuit against Sam and me. bar firm, which is weird. I'm not mad at her for like it's not like she does something wrong. just an lawyer in another state. Right. So we had to like deal with it and whatever and she's freaking out a little bit which is good showing like, hey, know, there's other things out here like don't take everything seriously.
00:53:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so when you're talking about flipping everybody off and saying whatever does that mean not being a lawyer anymore selling a business?
00:53:26 - mark sweet (3)
No, no, no, no. So sorry where I'm going with that is he's an lawyer, but now I'm at the point where I have money where I'm literally buying a mobile billboard just to go around his office for the next three months. I found the 14 billboards he passes from his house to his office, which we're picking up just to put our name on it so you can see that every single day.
00:53:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay, I'm on the go board.
00:53:53 - mark sweet (3)
It's gonna be the same space with our law firm. Oh, nice. Every single day.
00:53:59 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, that's funny.
00:54:01 - mark sweet (3)
So now we're in a spot where I can do that. So, you know, we're going to drop 20 or 25 grand on that, and I'm okay with it. It should also help generate business, which is great. So it's, you know, good purpose and, yeah, I mean, that's what I'm talking about to get to a level of you, or I can drop 25 grand on some that may not produce anything just to prove a form.
00:54:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. How long do you want to have your law firm?
00:54:31 - mark sweet (3)
I have no idea. Zero idea? I have zero idea.
00:54:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
If I got...
00:54:38 - mark sweet (3)
Because he doesn't know the other thing. I know. You're going to use an offer tomorrow. would sell it, but like you would have to be an amazing offer. It's not like I'm running the sell it or running the, you know, head it off to someone either.
00:54:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I'm going to plant this idea at your head, whether it be with me or the other guy you're working with, or whatever else, I highly recommend you try to work on figuring out what is your purpose. was for living this life. I'm happy to help you with that. You asked, that's not, that's not that the seeing people hired me for. It is definitely something that's come as a result of working with me. And that's something we can get clarity. that might be something that the guy that you're working with can help you with too. It doesn't matter. But you have to be willing to think about things and you have to be honest about it. you also have to know that that is an evolutionary conversation. Generally what you think the first time that you have that conversation, it doesn't end up being that. What you find is that it is a almost like a run on a ladder where you started the bottom and you kind of end up when you get more clarity. imagine the perspective from the ladder. So imagine that ladder is like 6,000 feet tall and you start somewhere towards the bottom, but the higher you go, the more you realize in terms of the expansive life and your impact, your experiences, things like that. And then because your perspective has changed, your information that you have to process those thoughts has changed. now more have information. If that was, let's say you're a cartographer and you're starting out at 1,000 feet versus 6,000 feet, and imagine that there's no limitation to your eyesight that you can now see whatever's available to you at 6,000 feet, your ability to map that area is going to increase because you can see it, aka more information, more data about what's around you and where you exist inside of that. So it has to start somewhere, you know, like when people ask you what do you want to be when you grow up? Almost everybody is not what they thought they were going to be for different reasons sometimes because of opportunity, sometimes just because they evolved and there's that perspective change, right? They didn't know that they had particular gifts. They didn't know that there was a dark side to the thing that they wanted to do. And once they experienced that, they're like, oh, that's definitely not for me. But then they realized that the positive aspect of it was what really drew them and that that positive aspect exists in something else that doesn't have the negative one as well. So anyway, but when you start to get closer to what life is for you and why you're here and why you want to stay here as in living why life matters to you, everything else falls a little bit more into place because the boundary lines almost kind of draw them. I want this, I don't want this, I want this, but it's incompatible with what I've said I am or who I've said I am or what I'm here to do. So then I have to ask myself again, do I really want this or do I want that? And so there it kind of installs a filter that or sift, if you will, impsive to run things for and it just creates this refinement. Which is another word for, it's not another word for, but it's likening to optimization, optimization in your business is refinement. Refinement in your person, optimization, so they're very similar. But you again, being the head of all the things, without that compass, which really is what purpose gives you, you know, the Cheshire Cat says. else's which way do I go goes well where are you trying to get to and she goes I don't know then it doesn't matter what path you take right? So anyway think about that and I would recommend that you work on it one way or another and then we can kind of revisit the conversation but I still have more questions so we can just pick it up whenever we're done with the marketing stuff next week and and work towards it uh because even without figuring out the purpose part there's still more that we can dial into them anyway we've had 15 minutes so I'm working from before I forget remember this week Caroline idea we had yeah yes yes yeah no it's not good news um it would be incredibly expensive to license the song to change the lyrics it is not incredibly hard to just use the song itself but the song and change the lyrics is
01:00:00 - mark sweet (3)
It's very expensive and very, very difficult.
01:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So would it be considered changing the lyrics if you speak the words kind of in cadence or they show up on a screen like if it was a TV ad at the same time as the words that a person already knows it's happening. So like sweet law, when sweet would sweet Caroline would be anyway. You know what I mean? Like it's kind of budging it. not actually changing the words. You're just letting them show up in the same timing as those words would be while other things are happening on there. Do you get what I'm saying?
01:00:45 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, the other idea would be to make Sam change her middle name to Caroline.
01:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then we're going to show that route. Or you can show it to yours. yeah. Uh, Yeah. Oh my gosh, that's hilarious.
01:01:03 - mark sweet (3)
So that may be the easier route.
01:01:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It me two weeks to get out of my head after saying that.
01:01:10 - mark sweet (3)
So Dan, just to bring up this stuff going on, theoretically using the Sweet Caroline song, which I'm sure you're familiar with.
01:01:20 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
The Red Sox love it, yeah.
01:01:24 - mark sweet (3)
But just instead of Caroline, it's three syllables.
01:01:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's like... Attorneys. Sweet, old turnies.
01:01:31 - mark sweet (3)
We love wins or something like that. And just play it on repeat because that song gets stuck in people's head like no other.
01:01:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, that's like jingles work because and so somebody gets in a wreck and they're like, oh, that stupid song is popping my head.
01:01:48 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh yeah. You can be like sweet claim of mine.
01:01:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah.
01:01:53 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh my gosh. of mine.
01:01:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Bada. Now you're mixing like sweet child of mine. I'm with the Neil time.
01:02:03 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So that's what they sing at the Red Sox. That's why I was getting these things. We Carolina every game.
01:02:10 - mark sweet (3)
You definitely do.
01:02:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And they do the pop.
01:02:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
my kids do it at their football games and all the kids stream it's a land. Anyway, okay.
01:02:21 - mark sweet (3)
You got to figure out how massage it to make it work, but.
01:02:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Well, I mean, all of these conversations can keep going throughout the weekend email so that we can we can keep traction. It doesn't have to be just Monday meeting calls. So keep that in mind too. But will you? Do you have any interest in trying to figure out what your purpose in life is? Yes. Okay.
01:02:58 - mark sweet (3)
So. Wait, continue what we're doing. Make sure that we have a profitable business.
01:03:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, that is not. That is not purpose. That's not purpose. The purpose of business is the make money period and story.
01:03:14 - mark sweet (3)
Yes.
01:03:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How you do it is a whole other thing. The principles within that is a whole not a thing. But the purpose is simply make money and be profitable.
01:03:27 - mark sweet (3)
Fair enough.
01:03:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not a thing that gets you through the hard times. it's also not a thing that really helps you to even create the values. The values come from other things. Yeah, anyway, so I asked you, do you have interest in it? The next question would have been, will you work on it intentionally? But since the answer was, wishy washy at best. I don't know how much that answer was mean, but I'll ask it anyway. Do you want to work on it and find a person that can help you with it?
01:04:10 - mark sweet (3)
I want to build a snowman.
01:04:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They do. OK, right.
01:04:20 - mark sweet (3)
have to build a snow.
01:04:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Why do you even know that?
01:04:26 - mark sweet (3)
Oh, I guess again.
01:04:27 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Things are stuck in the head. Why are you watching frozen Mark? That's you shouldn't even be familiar with this.
01:04:35 - mark sweet (3)
It's awesome.
01:04:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:04:38 - mark sweet (3)
Sure, Mark. Deadpool and I highly recommend it.
01:04:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, my God. had to go. My mom is like in post-surgery. She's like, but she lives like loose with my brother. And I had like, not this big deal, but my brother was out of it. you need to be here Saturday at two thirty. I'm not going to be here because he was going to see Wolverine. And he came back and he was like, oh God, it was so good or so good. We're so good. He's like, I won't tell you anything I was gonna say it's not Tina proves and if I try to watch it with vid it probably cut out 75% of the movie. Oh Yeah When Deadpool came out we we went Denise was like, oh, let's go see Deadpool and I was like And I hadn't seen it so I like, I don't know if that's a good idea So we had the original Deadpool, which would be like 2010. Maybe I don't know so the kids were like under 10. Oh, no Like four minutes. Yeah, and then Denise was like Picking them up stuff like them out and then I stayed and watch the movie I'm not leaving They tried to get into a different movie And I do think that I think the ticket person was like, really? you can take these kids Isn't frozen.
01:05:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh Mark, I'm just going to follow up with you and text you and ask you that until you give me a, I don't want to do it, now or I'll work on it or you can tell me, no, is that approach? Okay, because I want you to think about it a little bit more and just make a decision, either you do want to work towards that or you don't, because then if you do, then that helps my approach. And if you don't, I need to alter it.
01:06:26 - mark sweet (3)
Yes, that makes sense.
01:06:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

Hey, yeah, I can hear you.
00:00:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How was vacation?
00:00:05 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
It was good. Just got home really late last night. But other than that, it was fun.
00:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I had a good time. Yeah. Was it like a family thing or you just like hanging out?
00:00:18 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Nice. Nice.
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel? Well, you probably feel too tired to be refreshed, but. Yeah. Do you feel refreshed at all?
00:00:30 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah. Because my friends like, we like to really chill out. So we weren't doing too many activities.
00:00:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice.
00:00:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
We had a lot of time to relax and stuff. So I didn't think I needed a vacation. But after I came back, was like, yeah, needed that.
00:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's funny sometimes how you don't know what you need until you get it.
00:00:53 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
And then you're like, oh, It's like sometimes getting a massage and like the masseuse gets in there. like, I did not know that. I heard that bad and then exactly you did that and I was like, oh, I think I needed that.
00:01:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good though. I'm glad that you got it and I'm glad you got that perspective and hopefully you'll remember both that it was useful but also that you weren't aware of how much you needed it. So in the future just kind of think about your time and your energy and maybe there are other things that are day to day like you can't have a vacation all the time but like maybe there are other kinds of things that you could do with your time and your energy that would be helpful that you didn't really know would be like that impactful.
00:01:42 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
You know what I mean?
00:01:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So you've been gone a while so I have no idea if you've thought about any of the conversations we've been talking about like it's been a while a couple weeks since we've chatted. Any, any thoughts where you were gone or just preparing for the call today?
00:02:10 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Um, probably, but I don't really remember the last meeting.
00:02:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:02:18 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
know most of it was with Lorenz and, you know, how he structures his team and everything like that. But I mean, some good news is, you know, I was gone for a week and I would still check my computer and stuff, but I'm proud of the team because it's all the work that they were doing and, you know, how they were handling everything and, you know, obviously I wasn't there working full time, but it looks like they were able to hold things down, which makes me comfortable knowing that they were working and able to kind of handle the caselope without me being there. Um, so that was good to see that's that's awesome.
00:03:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Actually, so let me go because I was looking at the numbers for one. Um, which one is. Okay, July so for. So what I was finding interesting. And this month is definitely going to be skewed a little bit because you're out. Hold on a second. I'm still reviewing it. Um, so first of all, let's just kind of recap. Well, I'm taking it. I lost my notes. I don't have too many windows, but I need a few of them to be able to do this. So some of the things that we had talked about was just. Um, the leadership that you were already working on and employing in your team, things like noticing that. at Patsy needed a little bit more clarity and direction and like do this and you don't need to be asked to do it just you know here's your job here's what we expect and and get that done which probably went into you know how things went when you were gone and then I never really I don't know but I haven't memorized who you have I feel like it's Elsie I'm Cynthia Elsie and Cynthia yeah wait did I say Patsy what did I say yeah Patsy sorry I meant Cynthia oh my gosh I don't know what there's some names it just makes up in my head but I did know the difference sorry um although I don't have bases for either one of them so that that kind of happens but Patsy's are in Take Lady and Cynthia is yours and she's been bounced around a few people I remember um anyway so just kind of thinking about That those leadership roles, thinking about the kind of person that you are for your team, that you can be a safe space, which means that you actually have the ability to ask of your team things that other people couldn't. And I don't mean, you know, exceeding boundaries or anything, but meaning that they wouldn't get the same kind of results that you would because you're a safe person, because you'll ask and rather than make somebody feel afraid to mess up or do something wrong or get in trouble, they'll be like, oh, yeah, I totally could do that. And they feel empowered to be able to try to do their best job, because when people are afraid of making mistakes, they don't actually do their best at all. They just do just enough to get bias so that they don't cause problems, which is actually counterproductive, because they end up not, you know, giving their all, but it makes them feel a little bit safer to stay safe. smaller if that makes sense.
00:06:02 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Right.
00:06:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But because you have an energy that is not that is like you are intentionally looking out for how they feel and not wanting to overwhelm or intimidate or scare them off or make them feel bad, you can ask for say, you know, let's just just for example what you did with Cynthia say these are the things that I need you to do and then have compliance and have a work on it. So one of the things to try to look for is what are the other things that might be able to improve a little bit in terms of have follow up maybe with cases and making making calls in a timely manner, making sure that the cases that have the greatest potential for higher attorney fees are handled, or if one is at risk for whatever reason of sub-out or drop-out, well, not sub-out, but yeah, sub-out, not drop-out. That's being prioritized so that we don't lose the case, things like that. So that's one thing. I'm thinking I forgot what I was going to ask you. I should have wrote that down. Oh, oh proud. Okay, so we're looking at stats. me just provide some real quick. And I'm going to share my screen and don't think I'm sharing anything I'm not supposed to, and then I'll just get yelled at if I am just kidding because Mark doesn't yell, but not me anyway. Does Mark yell?
00:07:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Never.
00:07:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That sounds not right. I mean, I can see him having it, especially the conversations we had in the beginning. I think he told me about having a temper and I think I yelled at him a few times and said stop it. So, but I don't know how he is now. Anyway, okay, so I'm looking at cases this year and obviously I know that the thing to keep in mind is that you, your cases are throttled. You get a lot of Mark's cases. they're not just your own and everything hasn't been opened up to you like it has to the other attorneys. So, this is not apples to apples by any means. But I still think that it's impressive in the resolutions. So, in June, Tyler had 19, Samantha had 21, and you had 21. And to me, and I could be wrong about this, but that's kind of a good indicator. So, there was this, but it's not enough data, right? So, Look how small this one. There's only three for the month so far compared to 13 and seven and I almost don't even want to compare Tyler. I'd rather compare just Samantha. And then Lauren's isn't even on the board for this month. So You know what resolutions mean, like, is that Is it isn't that when you are paid out? Which one is the one that's your paid out? Which one is the one that it's done done?
00:09:30 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Done done is money and attorney's fees.
00:09:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but there's And then there's cases settled. Yes, and that's which one I'm trying to figure out cases closed or resolution.
00:09:44 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
That's one of these two. Okay, because whichever Okay, yeah, cases closed would mean money and And then resolution is like any sort of settlement.
00:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, so that that's what I was looking at. And that's the thing, this is what you guys have the most control over, not when you get paid, right?
00:10:05 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
How much do I have for resolutions?
00:10:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For this month?
00:10:10 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
00:10:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Three.
00:10:12 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah, that's not accurate.
00:10:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and that's the other thing, this is a new report. So I don't know if you remember, I was looking at it and saying I didn't know if I want to show it yet.
00:10:21 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah, my list is 10, so.
00:10:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and what about last month?
00:10:27 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
So I can compare. Last month was 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 2, 14, 15, 16, 18. 18? And those were all my cases, were any mark crossovers.
00:10:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and then let's compare cases closed, so paid, is I want to see what these numbers are and then all.
00:10:55 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
So last month I had 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
00:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, Okay. And the month before. One, two, three, four, five, six, eight. Okay. Oh, what did I click on? I'm gonna do that. Okay, so then I need to send a note off just a second. Mark.
00:12:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
You Okay.
00:12:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, I sent that off. Hopefully we can get that figured out. Oh, let's see. Policy limit. Okay, I'm not going to look at this anymore right now, whoops, because I want to make sure that it's accurate. So we'll dig into that. That report's only actually few days old, a few days, a few weeks old, and it usually takes us a few iterations, actually, let me go, let's see, reports, oh, that's why report reports. Let's see matters closed, we'll just type in matters, matters by team, or by principal attorney active matters, and I want that, I want that much by team. Let's see if I can edit this. No filter. I. Attorney. No, not as fun to be. Owner. So would the attorney be the owner?
00:14:29 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Probably. Yeah, that would be accurate. Sometimes it'll change and the owner will be the old attorney, but I don't have too many of those.
00:14:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so we'll just say. See if that will. Well. Save and run. And then. right. right. right. All right.
00:15:21 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
That means we take our fee and hold like a certain amount in a trust account until I'll hold in trust.
00:15:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, let's see but there's 141. So does that sound right? 141 records that you think that you've gone through? Let's see if I can create a status. I do want already. All right. So part of this process, though, is learning how to get better reports so that we can have, first of all, accurate data and then, well, accurate data that matters and really review it so that you can know exactly where you stand and also how you're ranking within the team. So since I don't have something reliable, how about you tell me what your team did while you were gone is as much detail as possible because that will also help me with the reporting stuff and then also help us with next questions and what we're going to work on.
00:16:46 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
You said how they did when were gone. would have to be choked.
00:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, let's just do this. Let's kind of take inventory of last week. So we'll look at how many new cases were there. How many got settled. Just any, any issues, any calls, if there was any disbursements that happened. Yeah.
00:17:23 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Okay, let me see. We got one, two, four, five new cases last week. We did two settlements last week. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. And then for fees, we got two as well.
00:18:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what percentage of. So you're going, your max is 40% right for attorney fees. Yeah. What, what, what were each of those two cases?
00:18:25 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
40%.
00:18:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
00:18:29 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah. One of them was a big, big case or fee was 68,000.
00:18:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And who handled that conversation?
00:18:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
I did that one. Oh, you did that.
00:18:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, good job. Okay. So you handled the conversation about distributions, not disbursements.
00:18:54 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah. Actually, for all my cases, I do once it gets to like closing it out, getting the district. patient sign, I do all that.
00:19:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, for all the cases, so what I'm trying to dig into is when you came back and you said your team did really well, how do you measure that? How do you quantify that? Like, what did you look at and go? That's they did that well.
00:19:25 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
I noticed I got multiple emails on certain cases where we were waiting one medical bill in order for me to send a demand and they would let me know that it came in and that it's ready to be demanded. The new cases that come in, I know that's all mostly LC, reaching out to the clients, setting them up with treatment. That was getting done. I can see that certain things that were coming in, Cynthia was saving them in the case files, know, notating how much the chiropractor. it was, we use this internal thing on Lidify, it's called Chatter. That's where they kind of let me know, you know, this on updates on cases. We had one case, it was like a weird sub out, it's one of Mark's cases, I guess the guy had another firm for like a while, and then he signed on with us. But I wasn't there to, you know, handle that, and Cynthia was able to send all the documents, the case file, so that got handled. And I would see the notifications on slide, like a call would come in, and you know, I'll see what, you know, take it. So I keep eye on those things, which lets me know that, you know, if they're not really on top of things that they'll either be slow to respond, or they won't take the call. Um, so that lets me know that, you know, they were on top of everything. Um, was sending me requests for authorized treatment for certain clients, um, is important because we need to make sure that, you know, the policy limits are adequate enough to authorize certain treatment, for example, Um, so she was asking me, you know, she was sending me emails and saying, can you please, you know, authorize X for this client?
00:21:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, and you, you know, you were on vacation. You responded to all of that?
00:21:39 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah. Yeah. had my computer out there. So, um, when I had time, I would go through and see what, you know, what was urgent and respond to those.
00:21:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think your average response time was during that time.
00:21:51 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
I was pretty slow because we're three hours behind over there. So. I was working like. I was. eight PM our time.
00:22:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you were so they never waited longer than a day. Yeah, that's awesome. I mean, you're you're so that kind of speaks to the leadership skills too. And now I know that it comes with the territory that stuff still has to get handled and has to be done timely.
00:22:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
But that doesn't mean everybody does their job. You know that, right? Yeah, I know.
00:22:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So one of the things that that probably had a huge impact on the fact that your team was staying on top of it was that you were also staying on top of it, even when on vacation. So that's really important. And you gave them a very clear signal that work matters and that we will we will get things done. And so even while not being physically present, although are you guys all remote? Who's in the office?
00:22:50 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Um, they're both in the office every now and then I'll see what we'll come home. Um, that's for the most part. She's she's in the office.
00:22:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So that's great. Now, if you were to go and look for things that maybe weren't handled well, first of all, did it occur to you to do that? Did you think about doing that? Did you do that? Look to see if anything slipped while you were on it.
00:23:20 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah, because what happens is on like, at some point we'll get like our clients policy limits or the other, you know, full parties policy limits. And I noticed like on two cases, like, because we get a lot of documents from this and team, it's like a lot. And I already told the team, like, I have like a CD, so I'll double check to make sure certain things get notated. And naturally like things, even when I'm there, like, I'll see we'll get to it, but for me, like knowing the policy limits is like one of the key parts of the case, because it's so easy to like authorize an injection. or we don't know what the limits are and it can get really bad, so I just like to know and it's just like a piece of mine for everybody, even Mark, when he's looking through the case to know, it's like our baseline for how the case is going to go. So I just noticed like we would get a declaration page which shows policy limits and then just wasn't notated in the file. So there were a few cases where I went and I did that myself, which I do when I'm in the office anyways. But other than that, nothing where I was like, hey, like keep an eye on this, can't make this mistake again type of thing. I just honestly felt like I was just another week.
00:24:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so that kind of stuff happens anyway, right?
00:24:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Is that what you're saying? it gets done, but like I'm just like when I see those like two letters PL, which means policy limits like I'm just like really quick on it just because I don't want to miss it.
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you've communicated that I'm sure you have to them that that that's the thing that like that has to be on every single case.
00:25:07 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
00:25:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how is that received? you feel like? I mean, this is the job and nobody's perfect all the time. Right. There's got to be a margin of error. But what we can do, what we can work on is focus on the big rocks. So what. What are the things that matter the most knowing what the policy limits are definitely right up there.
00:25:36 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Right.
00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if something else slips, that's maybe less important. And I don't even know what that would be. But, but let's say that there are non-negotiable like these always need to get done. matter what. Don't everyone see this. There's not a threat implied that there are anything. It's just that this is non-negotiable. Make sure this happens on every case. Do not finish or no. until you've checked yourself, are the policy limits notated, that type of thing. Have you had a conversation to that degree? Now, I can sound very kind of like hostile forcehole. So I'm not talking about with my energy, right? I'm talking about with that kind of clarity and emphasis on this has to be done every time.
00:26:26 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah, that's one of them. Because even they know like, if we don't know what type of insurance we're dealing with because Elsie sets up the treatment. So once she goes to do that, she'll naturally have a tendency to look and see how much room we have money-wise, you know, for treatment. Now there are times where we know the other party's insurance or our insurance has like a lot of money, then it's not as important to figure out everybody's coverage because if it's like half a million, like, there's... definitely plenty of money, so we don't need to know exactly how much everybody has right now, because the case probably won't go that far. But on cases where she's going to set up treatment a week or two has gone by and we don't have any insurance yet, then it's like they know to make sure we figure out or else if you're authorizing treatment without any insurance because there may not even be any insurance. That's when that gets like expedited, so they'll figure out how much money we have to work with. That's one. Another one is client calls when we get a new case, not to let it like more than one day go by without any client contact. I'm trying to think of other non-negotiables. like if a client's like kind of threatening to sub out like any type of like text or anything like that to call them right away or well sometimes I'll call right away just to kind of calm the client down because if you know say we get that text and no one reached out then it's you know pretty bad mistake so that's another one. Certain things like if we have a $15,000 limit never authorized more than one MRI because we don't have the money to. The teams are pretty good at that. I would say those are like the main like none of those triple things it's just like basic case management setups.
00:28:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I know that you're not in the place where you get incentive yet. And I know that the team doesn't have an incentive plan, but right now Samantha has her own, Lorenz has his own. I did talk to Mark about trying to standardize that. That's kind of a long process. It's an ongoing conversation about modifying that anyway. But in the meantime, these are the types of things that would be generating incentive pay for you, which would then give you something to reward them with. So do you have any sets, kind of review periods with your team or just like one-on-one conversations and meetings about performance and any issues they might have and what kind of support they need as a structured set type of conversation?
00:29:58 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
We have our weekly meetings. But other than that, like anything one on one haven't really done yet. Cynthia will come in like every now and then and just, you know, to me, make sure that she's doing a good job. And then with Elsie, I haven't had a one on one with her yet. I think she's only been with us almost not even six months yet. But like on the big cases where I know like it was a pain to settle that one or get it done or like a really big one, I make sure like on our settlement channel, you know, to put their names in there too, just to make sure that they feel like they're a part of it because it's so easy for the attorney to take credit on the cases where in reality, like the team is the one who's doing a majority of the grant work that helped. I'll just get the case done. I know Cynthia appreciates that a lot. I'll see's a little bit more.
00:31:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The appreciates just being given credit for that work? Yeah.
00:31:11 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Lawrence told me that when she did come to my team. So that's been good. So I keep those things in mind. if I know there was one case, almost half a million settlement, Cynthia helped get these records that the insurance really wanted to see before they would throw out an offer and she got that done really quickly. So when we settled the case, I made sure to put her name in there too, and how she helped contribute to the case. That's like not money stuff incentive, but yeah, I know that if I was on her end, you know, I would appreciate my work being noted, you know, that way, when they come to work, it's not like, well, I'm doing all this work and the attorneys. Taking all the credit for it. They get more pay to me Because at the end of the day like I feel like everybody thinks about those type of things I want my team to know like Just because I have a degree doesn't mean like I'm on a different pedestal Now sometimes I'll request records if I really need it Just to show them that like we're all on the same They level like no one's better than anybody And I feel like those type of things when I'm gone. It's like they do their best job when I'm not there out of respect Because of the way that you know I treat them overall Ask you a question though Do Cynthia doesn't do I have any kind of college degree? I don't know to be honest or elsey I'm not sure either one does the one thing to keep in mind is
00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
on a human being level and on a showing up to work level, know, that part is equal, but the investment that you made to get to your job is not.
00:33:12 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Right.
00:33:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
of school, so that kind of time, and then also the money that goes into school, whether you paid it out of pocket or however it got funded, that's a lot of money. Yeah. that, you'll never get that time back. You invested that to be here, whereas somebody else just applied for our job. So even if they got experience on the job somewhere else, they were still getting paid for that.
00:33:41 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
You don't get paid to go to school.
00:33:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. that is one thing to keep in mind when it comes to it is that you're not all equal in the workforce when it comes to that because you've paid a price that they didn't pay. So, your return is, the other thing is they are not accountable when things go wrong, you have the liability they don't. And part of the compensation is your risk and your liability for the work that's getting done. And that's a real thing. Now the odds that something is going to go so bad that you're going to, that it's going to ever actually cost you is probably pretty low because you're managing things well. But there is real risk involved in practicing law. And they don't have that risk, they don't bear that risk. And they didn't make the investment of all that time and all that money. So it is important and I want you just to kind of stash that away in case it ever comes up. And at least just ponder it like what does that mean and how would that show up when you do get incentive and I think that that is something that you should take into account. This isn't about being better than anyone else or how you show up right now. So for example, you know, when I do my work, I've had people try to figure out how long something takes me and want to pay me an hourly rates. And I work faster than five, sometimes 10 people, depending on who it is. I, but the reason I can do that is because I've acquired a lot of skill in my practice. I've put in hours and hours and hours of work and study and repetitions to make me really good at it. I have top-of-the-line equipment all the time, all the time. I say on top of it all the time. So when somebody's paying me and I don't even do hourly work anymore, but when somebody's paying me, they're getting access to all of that. All of those scales, all that experience, the money that I spent on the technology. And so they're trying to compare me, sometimes they would, this is historical, try to compare me to somebody else or what they think is industry standard. I'm like, son, I'm not industry standard. Look at the results, that's obvious. But it's the same kind of math, right? People want to do and think that they're doing the equation and that this is what it's like in a job. We're all a team and we're all equal, but not all teams are equal. So let's say you've got the captain of the varsity team and he steps down to play with the second string and they're not all equal. The skill level is not equal, the hours probably are not equal. So it's just important. I just want you to make sure that you keep that in mind. there's a way to use that information. and not understanding without, you know, it's not a power trip or lording over. I just want to make sure that you don't undermine yourself or discount what you have brought to the table and also the burden that you bear that is invisible because liability nobody's thinking about it. You might think about it from time to time. They're probably not thinking like if this goes wrong, you know, I might lose job at Patrick could be sued. You know what I mean?
00:37:33 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
00:37:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, I know it was a long whole monologue thing. I just want to talk about these things as we're kind of going into how you're structuring and leaning. Okay, so client calls now. Okay, so I think that it would be a good idea for you to set up and they can be very short, but monthly one-on-ones with individual member. So with right, your current team is just LC and Cynthia. So with each of them, and it should have a specific agenda of things that need to be covered for sure, all the non-negotiables should be covered, things that you've noticed. Hey, Cynthia, great job. a single one of your people went more than a day without being contacted when you were here, right? Any kind of threats to sub out, you handled it immediately. You never authorized more than one MRI when somebody had a $15,000 any of those things. So first of all, they know how much you're paying attention to what they're doing, and they're getting credit for not just, hey, good job, but very specific, good job, right? Did you play sports?
00:38:52 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
don't remember if you told me that or not. Yeah, I played a waterfall and I swam in high school.
00:38:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's right. I remember I remembered it was water. I forgot about the polo, but yeah, so anyway, just really specifics about about what they're doing and what they're doing really well and maybe especially because if let's say they're not doing one thing really well, when you bring that out, no, it does not feel good. likes that and but but it still has to be said. You can soften the blow instead of just by saying, hey, you need to fix this because this isn't happening and this is this is crucial. Soften the blow, but you have been amazing at this and you've been amazing at this and you've been amazing at that and so keep doing this job also and not but right because everybody ignores everything after the blood but also let's work on improving this and then when the incentive time comes around, you have specific things that you can. pay your incentive on. So it can be these types of things. There'll probably be some other things you want to break down. Basically, anything that is a lever or a switch, you know, in the business that makes a significant impact that you can track, that you can measure for sure, all of those things that you just mentioned. There may be a little bit more detail and nuance to it. Maybe it's the reporting. Maybe it's the communication. I don't know, but these are the things that we want to look at. And so then if you have a meeting with them each month and you're letting them know, hey, I've looked at all of this stuff and really you're like, I'm so impressed. You did this. You did this. You did this. You did this. You did this. that is amazing. I did notice this. I would love to work on this. Is there any way I can support you in doing better here? And then you be quiet and see what they feel like. And generally, especially if you really have people that want to do well and care about how you feel about it. You'll either maybe get the actually I know that I kind of been dropping the ball and I could do better and just okay will you do better and then again you be quiet. Not just hey I know you can do better but very specifically an accountability question will you do better and if they say they're gonna say yes nobody's gonna say no and sometimes they may say try I'll try and then you can rephrase it and say I didn't ask you if you try I asked you well you do better and if they say well you know I'll try it okay so if you can't commit to doing better is there a reason why you can't commit to doing better is it is that is that hard for you do you need some training in that area is it you know what I mean like Is that an opportunity to either maybe shift that task to somebody else or strengthen them, give them training? But if you see something wrong and they can't say, I 100% can do better and I'm going to do better, then you want to figure out and drill down a little bit more. OK, why not? And how can we make that better? But I think that with the goals that you have for just killing it, really, and the team that you have and the way that you're leading, just so back to leverage, right? Just by picking one particular thing to work on, which would be reviews over a very specific set of topics, which I would love to see. So do you feel like you have enough time to set this up by next Monday when we all meet together?
00:42:53 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
A set of incentive things that I would like to see?
00:42:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It could be incentive. But basically, it's like, what it... What are the criteria that you want to review with each of your team monthly that eventually will be how you can, and you can modify this so this can be rough draft. But what I would like is, yeah, that structure, these are the things that matter most, so I'm going to review it with my team. But also when incentive time comes around, it would make sense that the things that matter most impact incentive. So you don't have to figure out how you would structure it and how you would weigh it and what you would pay. But what are the topics that you would review with each person, and this should be like five to ten elements that you have. And you can rank them right. Here's our five critical and five non-negotiables, and here's our five, know, this is not as important, but this definitely impacts the quality of results type of thing. You think you could have a rough draft that by Monday? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. rough draft. I love the new part to that. Awesome. Awesome. I was thinking about then, you know, let the team know that starting next month and maybe, and maybe it'll be the end of the month so maybe like end of August so you've got time to put this together. And, but then I was thinking maybe we don't want to tell them and tell that you've put something together for sure to let them know what you're going to be measuring, rather than it being like a sucker punch. Hey, I'm looking at this, which it should not be right because they should be very aware of what their duties are. There's a magical thing that happens when people know that they're being scrutinized a little bit more as they perform well, especially if they feel like it's not a negative thing, like someone's paying attention, but they're not, you know, looking for ways to screw up. And you can tell them when they're doing it, like, Hey, I'm going to be looking at these things. And I know that Elsie, you're awesome at this stuff and Cynthia, you're awesome at this stuff. And but I really want to know how to celebrate your wins and really look at where you're shining. But also look for opportunities for improvement and see if there's any kind of training maybe that we can have, because that's the whole point of it, right? We're not trying to ensnare anyone and catch them in a trap. We are trying to help everybody be better and also make sure that we're looking at what we can appreciate in what they're doing. Make sense?
00:45:56 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
00:45:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. What do you think about that? how do you feel? I mean, I basically just kind of said, you should do this.
00:46:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
And I want to know what your thoughts are on it. I think it would be good. I know for Cynthia, it would be good for her to hear that she's doing good because like sometimes we'll just like talk about a case like in my office or whatever. And then before she leaves, she's always like, am I doing good? Like, just want to make sure I'm doing good. So I know she likes to feed back. And then with LC, I mean, we can test it out and see how she likes it. I think it would be good like review every month because like, let's say we set the standard today. Everybody, you know, all the boxes and then like month two, two and a half, things start to like naturally fall off again, which is normal. So it'd be like a good thing that they know like every month. I'm gonna, you know, ask about You know, X, Y, Z Whereas right now it's kind of like we already talked about it and it's up to them how long they want to continue to Work on those things So I might be good to have like a Set date every time, you know once a month that I'm gonna ask them about You know those five to ten key things I'm definitely opening to trying it because They'll also give me an opportunity to know that, you know, we go over this every month.
00:47:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there's no reason for it to Not get done So I do think it's a good idea So couple of things I thought about why you're talking And I know that you're still kind I'm now Elsie's only six months around, Cynthia has been moved around, so really to get a good kind of gauge of things, I would like you to commit to it for a minimum of six months, are you willing to do that?
00:48:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
00:48:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and then the other thing is what I would like you to do, especially so that they feel that this is opening the lines of communication and kind of reinforcing that the fact that this is a safe space is, is there anything, when you, at the end of it, ask them, okay, is there anything that I can do better for you? Do you feel like there's a system or process that needs some improvement? Do you have recommendations about how we can better operate? So it starts with the wins, what they're doing good, a little bit of a coaching session on anything that can be improved, and then we shift the focus off of them, and what can you what can I improve? And then we take it back to the processes. now we're ending on it. It's not a personal note, and then you can just end completely on. Again, you've done an amazing job at these things. Good job, looking forward, you know, to the next one, keep up the good work, that kind of thing so that you can kind of purposely direct the energy almost like conduct, like a music conductor. Right? You purposely starting in a specific spot and ending on a specific note so that it has the the best positive income and doesn't have like any kind of negative impact on the day. Even if there's a coaching session, you kind of take the heat off with making, putting some attention on you and just the business in general. Yeah. Okay. So you have your weekly standup meetings. What is the format of those or what you didn't call them standup, but you We can team meetings. What is the format of that?
00:50:04 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Typically, if I have something that I want to like an urgent thing, I'll usually bring that up first. But most of the time, we kind of just, you know, they have any concerns about certain cases or like a question, I'll just ask them like on any specific cases you guys want to go over. Um, you know, anything that, because if it's like really urgent, obviously we talk about it like right then and there, like else you just message me or come into my office. So the meetings are more things like that come up, but they're not like super urgent. For example, I'm trying to think of an example. Like there was one, there were like denying liabilities, like a word for word to spew. So LC asked me, know, how should we, you know, approach this case? And they know, I tell her, you know, how I would do it. And then for Cynthia, typically, you know, Oscar, are there doctors that are giving you issues on, you know, record requests, are they taken too long? That way I can, you know, reach out personally and try to get it done faster. Sometimes we'll change like how we do things in those meetings. For example, like, I don't know if you know what the health insurance liens are, but Cynthia typically handled those and a few meetings ago. So typically what they'll do is they'll send a form for us to fill out. But I realized when I would do it, I would just call a number. and give them the info that they wanted over the phone and it was much quicker so like in the meeting I was you know advice and they're like hey I tried this because it served responsibly to get those in I was like you know let's try just every time we get one of those requests just call them and give them the info instead of you know filling out the paper faxing him back so in the meetings like if you want to change something how we do things you know we'll go over that in the meetings and then just like general questions like you know are you guys overwhelmed like I always ask Elsie because I know she takes like 90 percent of the phone calls I'll ask her like are you overwhelmed like are you able to are you handling everything do you need me to you know take a few calls this week to you if we get a lot of cases obviously she's gonna make a lot of calls so I Ask her if she needs any help. Typically she's she's able to handle everything. But yeah, let's typically have the meetings go.
00:53:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And are they scheduled regularly?
00:53:18 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
No, there's no set date to just kind of just I'll just let them know like are you all available for meeting like at 3pm on a certain day or something. But I don't have like a set date yet.
00:53:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So do you for sure have them every week?
00:53:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
I mean, we've missed a few weeks like sporadically. But I always talk to them like in the office like they'll talk to us in our office. Cynthia too. But I should probably have like a set date every week to do them.
00:53:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you learn this in the military, right? there is real power in structure because no way. to expect, you can anticipate it, which means you can be better prepared for it, right?
00:54:06 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
00:54:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And generally, when we're better prepared for something, the outcome is better. So my recommendation would be to go ahead and schedule that as ideal of the time as you can, where it is a set time every week, and then, you know, if somebody gets hung up on a call or whatever, then you modify it if need be, but do everything you can not to modify it. And at worst case scenario, you know, everybody stands by if they can for a little bit, or more importantly, what should happen because the only only way that that's not controllable is if there's an inbound call that took a really long time, but even still call control skills can kind of probably help with that. So, like, one of their things would be don't make a call, you know, 30 minutes or so, or don't take a call, 15 minutes or so. before the meeting so that nobody gets stuck on a call, make sure that we can show up and be prepared. then the meeting can have a similar structure to the reviews, not necessarily the same stuff, but a very specific structure. One thing I would recommend is start with the winds. It always kind of helps the mood and the energy, especially if everybody knows that's where we're starting. We're not going to dive right into stress. We're going to say, hey, because I know you're watching your team anyway, right? Hey, you did this good. You did this good. So Cynthia can now start getting her weekly kudos and you could say, Cynthia, you're killing that at this, this, this, you're doing a great job. Thank you. Even if you have to get into the issues, eventually where it comes up like, oh, also I'd like you to work on this type of thing. It started off with the wind and you can end with, you know, again, here's how I can support you kind of thing, which is something you're already doing. So start with the wind. and then you could either get two concerns or questions or the urgent thing. You might kind of play around with that a little bit and find out how that works because here's the thing, you're at the meeting, it's going to get handled. Where it falls in the meeting isn't as important to anything other than the energy of the meeting. So you kind of want to put it where where I like, again, energy sandwiches. I think we talked about these a little bit. I don't remember if we did or not. Good things, bad things, then good things, sandwich. So that's something to think about. And just because it's urgent doesn't necessarily mean it's bad and it may be top of mine and they want to get to the issue quickly. and when still, they don't have to be long winded. want to keep everything as 16th as possible because nobody loves just having meetings. for the sake of meanings. So get in, celebrate the wins, get those kudos, you can do urgent thing, or the concerns or questions, and maybe a concerns or questions specifically for Cynthia, and then concerns and questions specifically for Elsie, and then is there anything that I can do to support you, and then just wrap it up and have a set time. So 20 minutes, 15, 20 minutes, probably is all you need, maybe even less depending on how complicated it is, and also if your team is doing a great job of communicating all week long as the issues arise, you don't want to save it for the meaning. Your business doesn't work that way. So they really should be able to be pretty short. The biggest thing is those urgent things if it's on a planned schedule, right? Because you can definitely have have a we needed meeting to get on the same page. right now and so forth, and that wouldn't be the same thing. The structure would be different. That would just be simply a resolution call, right? But this call, if there's an urgent thing that gets brought to the call, then probably it's already been discussed and you're just, you know, getting to the nitty-gritty of it, and basically getting clarity. So those types of conversations, if and so that dialogue back and forth verbally is what allows for that clarity to happen. So other than that, 15, 20 minutes really should wrap it up, and then they know, especially Cynthia, because I think that she really needs that feedback and she really needs that interaction, especially from what I learned about Lorenz, and she really needs that encouragement. That can be a great time for her to do it, but she also seems to respond well to coaching, especially the way that you're doing. doing it so that gives her everything that she needs and now we start compounding that happening every week and then monthly they get one-on-ones it's a little bit more detailed about specific stats we look at this six months from now I and I don't know when you're gonna hit that incentive period where you guys really get to just kind of blow things up but I think your trajectory is gonna be amazing I think that that consistency and that structure based on what you told me about how you've already applied some structure and accountability but also just support I think I think that you'll probably have some pretty stellar results that you'll notice yeah I'm open to that and everybody else has like structured days I just it's weird like sometimes I'll notice like the beginning of the week is kind of slow
01:00:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
So, I'm like, I don't want to do my meeting on like a Monday and everything happens and then we have to wait till Monday to like have another meeting. But I'm thinking like Thursday would be good because we have our firm meetings out Wednesdays.
01:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you can also have like a Monday morning email that you send out to everyone if you want to that maybe you dropped it on Sunday night and it's just maybe kind of stayed at the union. Hey, this is where we're at. These are our priorities. We'll have our meeting on Thursday and it could just what you could do is take. So let's say you use like an AI recorder or something or use a record and then and put it in the eyes so you can get some notes, have somebody taking notes. Somebody needs to take notes for sure. Otherwise, it's kind of pointless because you want to be able to track the conversations and you want to track the results because if you don't have data, you're not tracking anything, you're giving it to. human error, which there's going to be human error anyway, but it kind of diminishes the power of those conversations when you're not really tracking what's happening from them. So, somebody taking notes really well or use a recorder, and I can show you how to give it to an AI so they can summarize for you, something like that if you want. If you're nerdy, I'm sure you figure it out yourself. So, but I would recommend doing that. And then you can take those notes, instead of sending them out after the call on Thursday or after meeting because you're in person. Monday, hey, here's a recap of our meeting notes. you know, anything that might have happened between Thursday and Sunday night or Monday morning whenever you send it, you can say, here's a quick little update on a specific case or issue or whatever. And just go team go and we'll, we'll meet on Thursday, let me know if there's anything urgent and then you deal with the urgent things as they come up, but those three structure points. So we're talking about monthly one-on-ones, weekly scheduled meetings, Monday, kind of recap of the call and just additional support, clarity, prioritization, that kind of thing. If you have then something that comes up urgent, just tell them. If something comes up urgent, into my office, let's have a call, let's do whatever, let's meet and get it worked out so that it gets moved and processed and it's not weighing heavily on you or anything like that. And if everything else is being managed well and optimized, you should have the freedom to be able to deal with those types of fires and really give it focused energy so that you can handle it. So additional meetings are totally okay. If you want them, if you need them, but the structure and the committed time just kind of helps everybody say alert and focused and accountable with them, you know? Yep. Okay, so let me know how it goes. It's always a plan to start with it. The reality is everybody's a little different, the teams are different, the feedback is different, but what we do want to do is at least give it a chance to work because week to week, everybody's going through different things, feeling different things, different things happen, that type of thing. So if we could commit to this weekly schedule for at least three months, try to be as committed and consistent as possible. If you're just like, it's really networking, this is a problem, this is not the best way to do it, then let's change it up. the odds are that the structure is definitely going to be more beneficial than not.
01:03:51 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah, I agree.
01:03:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I hope you're so glad that you're having these conversations. You didn't answer. just left. Well, you're back and I just bombarded you with a lot of things. But what I would like to know is, and maybe give you some time to think about it, is come back and let me know and you can send me an email. I'd rather not wait until the next one on one. But how you felt about this call, and I think that that's something I need to do. So I'll send you notes about what we talked about and what we're going to work on. But then I would love some feedback from you like, okay, this was useful. This isn't really what I'm looking for. That type of thing so that I can structure this for your best benefit as well. Okay. All right. Do you have any questions?
01:04:54 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
I don't. excited to go back to the office tomorrow and close out the month strong.
01:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I think you're going to do amazing. I'm oh, it's so weird to get emotional about dumb things sometimes. It's not dumb. I like seeing winners win, but I like seeing good people win, especially. And I think that you're on a great track. I think that it's you've got some amazing qualities on a personal level, on a professional level. And I'm really excited to see your career evolve with Sweet Law, because I think that you've got some special qualities that are really good.
01:05:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Well, thank you. I appreciate that. Like I said, I enjoy the meetings because I'm the type of person that'll just pull my head on work and not really talk about certain things. it's good to kind of have you as somebody I can balance ideas off or someone to tell me, know, you should try this because I'm always open to that.
01:05:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would love to be the sounding board too, because I'm sure that you have ideas like that. I know your brain is working, you're just really quiet about it, because you're one of those that like, don't talk about it, about it, you just give about it. sometimes like, you know, that's the general rule for the general population, right? But you always have like your internal people that you should and could kind of talk about and riff with. And I know you've been like the lone wolf, but I'll tell you like, I'm 47, I'm about to be 48. I was always the very lone wolf independent, I can do better by myself, whatever. But I'm learning that as you, the bigger you grow and the more you increase your stewardship, right, the bigger teams are, or the more that you have maybe leadership roles in other parts of life, whether it be parenting or coaching or heading up some type of organization or whatever starting your or whatever to do. Being able to tap into other people's strengths, having conversations, peer-to-peer, mentor-to-mentor, or peer-to-mentor that students to mentor, my brain, it's Monday, anyway, but, but getting in the practice of not talking about all things to all people, not being like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, that drives me nuts, too.
01:07:25 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
01:07:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But really, you just kind of like, I'm trying to figure out the best word to use, but just contemplating, but kind of co-consomplating, know what I mean, riffing back and forth about what you have stewardship over with somebody that has some kind of understanding about it, and it doesn't necessarily need to be the same type of industry, but leadership to leadership, right? Management to management could be law-to-law, that type of thing. So, just because you're still young and bringing these things in and you'll find that there's just a handful, like you'll be lucky if you get even five of those type of people that you can really, really, really be open with throughout your life. But when you find them, talk about what's in your head because the feedback that you'll get will be very different when you're not just listening but when you're really actively participating and sharing what you think and what even you might feel about some stuff. So anyway, that's just my encouragement to not hold back, not to change how you are quiet, had down things like that. But in small moments, just kind of engage a little bit more at a higher level from time to time and only with specific people so that you can really develop your own leadership at a higher level, because I think that, like I said, I think that you've got innate leadership qualities and that whole iron sharpened iron kind of thing. It's there something to it.
01:09:15 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
01:09:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:09:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
would you say sorry as a thankfully, Mark, you know, has you as a tool to help all of us and Yeah, really appreciate it.
01:09:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm glad to do it. I really enjoy it. So anyway, I won't take any more of any more of your time any calm down Another call. Anyway, I hope you have a great day. I'm glad you're back from vacation. I look forward to your report I will send you this email. Maybe not until tomorrow because I have some things. I want to add to it But it but it will be there and then we'll follow up next week Sounds good. All right, you have a great week. Thank you. You too. Thanks. Bye

00:00:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Long day.
00:00:17 - Chona Sweet
It's okay. But yeah.
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, how has this been gone so far?
00:00:24 - Chona Sweet
I mean, it's getting a little better. I still feel sometimes I. Overwhelmed, but. And I. To be honest, I have a lot of charting.
00:00:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because you just have a lot of calls or because you're behind and not doing it.
00:00:46 - Chona Sweet
Behind and doing it.
00:00:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So why is that? How much, how far behind are you, do you think? these wise.
00:01:03 - Chona Sweet
I have I'm looking at it right now. have 80 notes.
00:01:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not including, huh? Go ahead.
00:01:12 - Chona Sweet
Not including maybe I have to say not including today. Like maybe close to 99 total. No. Yeah, 99 total. And the hospital. I just got home.
00:01:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I haven't charted the hospital. When did you get started?
00:01:46 - Chona Sweet
hospital. was unable to do. I was able to chart every day. Like that one. I was able to do that every time. was And the lean patient that comes from me, I mean from my sources, from me, I was able to do that.
00:02:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So when you say you were able to, does that mean you're not able to when you work at the clinic?
00:02:20 - Chona Sweet
I guess what I want to say is I feel more motivated to finish the charting on the hospitals and ones that I really don't like, there's a lot of work on the heart charting in the hospitals. I mean, I'm sorry on the clinic and I don't, I don't really want to do it. That's really what it is. I really don't, I was able to do what I need to do in terms of, in terms of, like I prescribed their medications, but I wasn't able to to finish the note. But I feel like the main job that I need to do, I was able to do that, I guess that that makes sense. But the note I know is part of it, but I just been I've just been not doing, not keeping up maybe that's the time. The telemedicine is easy notes. Yesterday's telemedicine, I did it exactly at the same time as I was doing it. Today, I sleep in, so I was only able to call all my telemedicine, but I haven't started the note. I plan to do it tonight after dinner.
00:03:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what time did you get started working today?
00:03:53 - Chona Sweet
I started working at 1.30 today.
00:03:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What happened to the conversation? Last week about wanting to make a million dollars a year and the only way you're going to get started in morning.
00:04:06 - Chona Sweet
I started the morning yesterday.
00:04:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What time?
00:04:10 - Chona Sweet
Um, I started at 10. Well, no, I started working the moment I woke up I mean, yes, wait, what is today?
00:04:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Today's Thursday.
00:04:19 - Chona Sweet
Um, you see, when I woke up, usually would call my telemedicine and then I would go to the hospital. Today, that's not, I just sleep in. I just feel tired.
00:04:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I gave in and. You feel like you're burnt out?
00:04:39 - Chona Sweet
Yeah.
00:04:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, is, is the clinic something that has to be done? Like is in order for you to have this arrangement with Dr. E towards building the.
00:04:54 - Chona Sweet
I think it's my help right now because of the rolling in of. the patients, the thousands that are coming in, and apparently we're just gracing that just the top and, you know, all of us are, you know, the other end piece we would talk to each other to just say hi and they said that they're also feeling overwhelmed because everyone has new patients and they double book because some patients don't show up, some show, you know, so it's like, for example, on Tuesday I have a schedule of 13, I think, in the afternoon, or I forgot 20, and then only more than half was seen, but because it's new, it's just a lot. So that's what I've been doing now so that it will be easier for me to chart later on is I Started pre charting, but correctly while I'm with the patient So, you know, that's that's what I've been doing versus a chicken scratch of Pain in low back like this and that you know, just one word two words. I don't do that now Oh, I you tell me you started that like a week or two ago though but No, I well I started probably a week ago, I feel like I I'm not consistent in terms of Doing that, but because if I feel like I'm already I feel I'm feeling overwhelmed and then I just start doing the words But now I've been like really doing it every patient that was that way when I taught it's faster when I finish it It's faster when you say now you're doing it consistently as of what day did you start doing it consistently oh I guess yet last week Monday true because I only have clinic Monday Tuesday And then the rest is sporadic Depending if I have lean patients Your charts how far are the oldest one go back One and a half weeks Um, it's not telemedicine. I'm on top of my telemedicine notes, but it's the it's the clinic new new patients. I'm It's like I'm dreading it like I'm dragging my feet and doing it because I It's just more work because I I just feel like And also there's a part of me sometimes that questions You know, it's just it's just worth it. It would come up because I feel like I have eight hours' worth of work for what? And I, comparison to what I used to work with my old job, that I only worked three and a half hours and I get paid the same exact thing. And so there's a part of me that, yeah, I'm trying to look past this. I'm looking past this and I'm trying to look at the potential, the earning potential, because of the lean patients, lean lean cases. I'm not seeing that yet.
00:08:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's slowly coming in, but it's... lean patients will come through the clinic? Will the lean patients come through the clinic? Yeah. I'm trying to get at is, is handling his clinic patients required to build the lean version of the business? Not required.
00:08:52 - Chona Sweet
It's just, I think, like...
00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's what we have to really get to. So... you're having this internal wrestle and Eventually a decision is going to be made for you if you get so behind your stress levels is gonna make the decision Then you're gonna walk away Because it's too much and it's overwhelming or dr. E's gonna say don't do this anymore because you're not getting the charting done And this needs even though they're overwhelmed So I don't know where that's gonna happen at some point it breaks it either gets fixed or it breaks, right?
00:09:28 - Chona Sweet
I think It's not required if the answer your question is not required however Because the lean clinics maybe that's the term the lean clinics is not full running I Don't have a reason to say hey I cannot do your clinic patients now because I'm focusing on the lean we're not there yet I don't know how long look you take so okay, but
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, hold on a second and I need you to bear with me because I have a very analytical brain and I'm also very tenacious. I go after things. If there's a problem, I'm working to solve it because it's the only reason I'm here, right? So, week after week, it's been... You've got lots going on. Remember, you've got to take all this into account. There's a lot of learning, but now we're getting into where we're having the same conversation on repeat. And just so you know, I have a few cardinal rules. One of them is I don't have the same conversation on repeat without it making progress because I cost too much money to not make progress. And if that's happening, it's either that I'm not a good fit and a good batch for you, or you're not where you should be, so you're out of sync with your own self. I don't know that that's the case. But I need you to understand that that's the way that I look at things and that's the way that I process them. Okay, so I don't just care about the business. I don't just care about the money. I can't help but care about the person that I'm working with. So seeing you, you're you're having a dilemma that needs to be solved, but you are the only one who can solve it. And until you get bought into what you really want to do, you're not going to do it. And if you're not going to do it, there is no point in me showing up every week. Does that make sense? Right. So a few of the things are, for example, in terms of consistency. Now, I understand that charting is frustrating and difficult, but here's a few other things. asked you to report wins each day, just a win every day for the week and that doesn't get done.
00:12:00 - Chona Sweet
on.
00:12:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let's see, hold on there or something else. Where's my Oh, so three weeks ago, I asked for and I asked for it multiple times, but I division of like what Cheryl does versus what you do, just kind of visualize I even started it graphically wrote it out for you. So there's some resistance that is happening. And I want to see if there's any way that I can help you with it. Without piling on, because it's very easy for everything to feel like piling on, like I can do stress. I can feel your overwhelm, I can feel your frustration, but also there's the mom in me that wants to make everything better. There's like I've got all these rolled tona, they come out and this doesn't mean I'm right.
00:12:54 - Chona Sweet
It's just the way that I work. That's all I'm saying. Right. And I change it.
00:12:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know. Hold on. I want to, I got
00:13:00 - Chona Sweet
get all the way through this.
00:13:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So 99 charts to be behind on that, there comes a point where that you can't that can't not be taking up mental space and that cannot not be getting heavier. It has to start getting heavier and heavier. And so there is either an implosion or an explosion that's about to happen at some point. Now I don't know you, you might be somebody who can just like buckle down, sit down for the weekend and knock everything out.
00:13:31 - Chona Sweet
you that person? Yes.
00:13:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, I just saw Mark shake his head.
00:13:38 - Chona Sweet
But I am that person though. I, I, I passionate and I'm not consistent. Those are my, I know my biggest weakness. But when I sit down and buckle down, like I would be awake for three AM, four AM sending emails to the point that they asked me to like, do you sleep? but in at night or because they see my emails at 3 a.m. 4 a.m.
00:14:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
because I need to send an email saying oh please get an authorization for epidural for this patient so I need to send each time so they can see that but I just feel I'm still in the overwhelmed stage and when I get overwhelmed I question if this is worth it and I start comparing what I when I used to do what I used to make before this is the problem you can't get out of overwhelm if you don't show up consistently and what you're saying is you're on an infinite loop of you're not going to show up consistently and still it it makes more sense to you but if you're looking if you're doing that math now here's the thing there's two math equations that we talked about the one is what you're making now versus what you made and then the other one is what is the potential if you see this thing through you have to decide which math you want to look at.
00:15:01 - Chona Sweet
Right? Because both are true. It's just some matter of what I mean.
00:15:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, well, one is potential true and one is current truth. I need to know like, are you have you decided your and now here's the other thing is you've got some room to change things just because you feel obligated to work in the clinic right now. According to what you said, that's not you need to work in the clinic enough to understand it and know how to handle the lean patients inside of his face. But you've already gotten to that point. So what would happen if you said, okay, I'll do five five patients in the clinic a day, everything else you have to handle and that make sure I stay fresh that I stay in here. But to be honest, that's not what I'm here for. I'm happy to help out in this way or that way, whatever thing you're actually willing to help out. But Jonah, if you're if you're going to build a business and if you're going to lead and create, make the rules that work for you. But what you can't do is agree to rules and then not keep them. Right. That will ruin everything even internally for yourself.
00:16:18 - Chona Sweet
I think if I really want to, I would. I know if you really want to, sorry. I think there's resistance within me because I don't really like the clinic work. But I know that it actually is important in building my clinic muscle, if that makes sense. Yeah. the clinic muscle is what also would help me with the lean patients in terms of recognizing, oh, this is where I'm hurting. Just the symptoms. But although even though I already know because it's just a matter of a few procedures, it still helps because the hospital patients and the clinic patients are totally different. Right. the clinic patients is comparable to the lean patients.
00:17:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I get that.
00:17:19 - Chona Sweet
That's why it makes sense for me to do this.
00:17:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's just that. Are the lean patients going to be as much work charting?
00:17:30 - Chona Sweet
I mean, it isn't. It isn't because it is because I'm still new on it and I'm still trying to learn the lean type of charting. It's different from how we chart. This is where Mark comes in. This is where Dr. and I'm learning through the Zoom meeting every so often on how to chart correctly. And the resistance also is Dr. E. It's Dr. signing that lean patient notes and he's a little bit resistant on how Mark thinks and how it should be done because it's different from how we do our notes for patients where we're under scrutiny and their insurance.
00:18:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How you deal with that? How does that stress you out?
00:18:25 - Chona Sweet
I talked to Mark about it and again because I'm in the learning stage I feel I don't feel too confident to say to stand up for it but I'm still I'm still in the learning stage it's very early like Dr. E would ask me why don't we put this why because I really don't know how to answer the question I know but I don't feel confident to tell him like why are we doing And for right now, I'm just saying because this is how the rest of the PI doctors are doing it And this is what attorneys look for, but I feel like it's not enough. He hasn't bought into it yet. He's I think he's What's the right term, He's He's not fully bought in though.
00:19:19 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't think that honey like we're up to him to make changes and then we're not necessarily telling him why behind it There's some things that he understands why we're changing things like In a record, there's a subjective section and that's where most of the writing occurs Then there's a symptomology section where they're going through different tests, that's how they figure out what kind of pain Then there's a feeling portion and then there's a plan portion of pay.
00:19:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is what we're gonna do, right?-hmm.
00:19:48 - Chona Sweet
That's good that right honey like yeah for a four sections subjective what the patient says Also, yeah soap note so and he and he that's not how we charge right now with her patient. So in his mind, the way he thinks is if I get called in court of this patient that you saw, because he did in the past, you know, he's been called in, what's that term litigation?
00:20:14 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He's been deposed.
00:20:15 - Chona Sweet
He's been deposed. So the way he answered the question is, well, this is, I'm not doing this just for the lean patients, I'm doing this is the same thing I do with the rest of my patients who's being under insurance. So that's, in his mind, it's easier to I guess defend what he does because that's.
00:20:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But he's got liability for your main patients?
00:20:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Or not? Yes, because no one's signing it. So I talked because he understands his notes are not the best. I mean, he readily understands that he has false and his notes. His biggest issue was I want to leave in the different tests that we're doing with the patient and what the results are, where Fuji or pandellas or any of the ones. I worked with don't put that part in it doesn't make or break a case the only time it's a problem is that the client says I don't remember doing any of these tests and they're in the report It's the only time it's a problem. He's very open-minded to changing his subjective section at the top Because he's just got a very old-school way of doing it, but just right. Oh, it's cool Yeah, hey, and it's not born out of anything Negative like he's not It's just he just writes down what someone says.
00:21:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:21:28 - Chona Sweet
Oh, that's how we were trained.
00:21:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's how we were trained Yeah, but here we're taking a legal side of no, no, let's get them even less go through so they well Have you said anything you say can't and we'll be used against you or the court of law I mean it's that kind of premise right that if you have more than there's more to It's actually not a lot to he he doesn't really but he gets fixated on one thing That's not written there, but it's actually very small like for example on the third part on the
00:22:00 - Chona Sweet
assessment part. I'm sorry on the objective part. Old school note on objective, we do it by systems. General, meaning the patient is awake, alert, oriented. Respirations, patients, long sounds. We don't do that on the lean patients. I don't put the card, your card jack is the heart rhythm normal. Like I don't do that because we don't, I don't assess it because it's the, it's a lean patient. We're focused, like Dr. Fuji's note is on the Dr.
00:22:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Fuji's note, he says focus physical exam.
00:22:37 - Chona Sweet
E wanted more than three systems. He wants psychiatry, skin, you know, like the old school.
00:22:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So can you find examples of old school or more appropriately appear? So someone his age in this business that does it your way.
00:23:01 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, we killed him. He showed him and he says is someone who's in the same area.
00:23:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, roughly the same amount of practice who he's actually buy out and what he's doing. Here's the thing though. What Dr. E wants to add in doesn't make or break a case.
00:23:18 - Chona Sweet
It doesn't.
00:23:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. How much time does it take? What's the burden?
00:23:21 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What's the issue? Not massive.
00:23:24 - Chona Sweet
I'm asking Jonah because it's not a lot. Right now what I've been doing for lean patients is just the general appearance of a patient, a neck and a musculoskeletal back. I could add psych. could add skin. Then that's it.
00:23:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, in two minutes, tell me why you're doing any of this.
00:23:51 - Chona Sweet
Why am I doing the lean?
00:23:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, all this work with Dr. E in two minutes.
00:23:59 - Chona Sweet
I'm sorry. which one like all of it or yeah any of it like why do you show up to work every day I show up to work every day because I have to and I have I have to and I want to do the let work in the especially in the hospital I really do hold on a second hold on a second so I need you to tell me but I also need it to be true do you have to I feel like no one will be no one will be able to replace me to see those patients or I guess they can I guess they can replace me but I don't know I mean as much as I'd love to say I'm irreplaceable it might take four people to do my job but I'm not irreplaceable I don't think yeah they're right but we need to be real about the language because here's the thing if you don't tell the whole trip your brain is gonna find a loophole and it's going to tug at that
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and take you off track. So 100% all true, why do you show up to work every day?
00:25:07 - Chona Sweet
I need to work.
00:25:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need to make money. No. Do you need to?
00:25:13 - Chona Sweet
I need to.
00:25:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What will happen if you don't?
00:25:17 - Chona Sweet
I mean, and then I won't have money. I am going to rely on Mark, which I don't like that.
00:25:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you feel compelled to because the feeling of relying on Mark doesn't feel good, but the truth is you don't need to and your brain knows that. Probably that's why there's no probably about your brain knows you don't have to, which makes you feel like you've got room to make choices and the choice can be, well, I'm going to do it this way and whatever happens happens. They don't have to. That's what's happening every day.
00:25:59 - Chona Sweet
That's what the wrestle is right don't have to and no matter how you phrase it the powerful chona inside knows you don't have to right so that can't be if you tell yourself that story you're wasting time and you're lying to yourself and you're setting yourself up for failure so something happens the other day and i just want to say it and then you tell me then then why because dr e was in the hospital yesterday for a he did a procedure for one of our patient and then he asked me he called me i did the procedure for the patient do you want me to rounds on the patient because i'm already here that's what he says but then you know it's up to you whatever you want to do because he's that kind of doctor he's fine he's i'm here do you want me round down many patients do we have and then i said oh we only have i believe 17 or 18 then i told him no i no it's okay i'll i'll
00:27:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
round.
00:27:01 - Chona Sweet
So what does that tell you?
00:27:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am, you know, because maybe I'm not eating it because I want to see my patients. You like the hospital though?
00:27:11 - Chona Sweet
I do. That's different.
00:27:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But that's not the issue. Here's, here's the thing is where you're not showing up. That's the only issue. But you have to show up. Like you either need to be all in or get out because you're talking about building a business. And even if you were an employee, if I have somebody that was that far behind after a week and a half out of fire done, I didn't care what helped their giving me. I need to know that they're going to show up consistently. Now that's my particular baseline. That's not everybody's I hire differently, I train differently, I fire differently. It's just, but business has to be nuanced and it has to match the person, the visionary. You do have a very specific clear vision. But as we said, you're building in somebody else's house. Okay, you have to take that into account and you have to decide are you going to make your own? Which can mean I will do five clinic patients a day no more so that I do get familiar with it But because they are slightly different than lean patients because I only going to take notes this particular way when they're Lean patients and also because I just don't like it and you have the freedom to be truthful about it What's he going to say no I don't want the lean patient money? No, I don't want you to help me with at least five patients Which is 25 patients a week? Why would anybody say that? Do you know what I mean?
00:28:38 - Chona Sweet
Right?
00:28:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
just feel like we're not I think what here's what I do here. Chona. I think that you can take more power Actively rather than possibly you're taking the power by not doing your work. That's possibly And actively you can take the power by saying I don't like this may sound bad, but that's the reality. love the hospital patients. Great. Some people probably don't like any of the patients. You should be happy about that. You are going to do some helping with the clinic patients and you're going to bring in lean business, which is going to help him have an entirely new income stream that wasn't available. That is sufficient. That is enough value. You live in a world where, first of all, as a woman and then also as a minority, but especially the women in your culture even, you're taught to take care of everything and to do the job and to be happy about it and to smile while we're doing it. But Feisty Chona is inside of there too and she's like, I don't like it. I don't want to do it. And Mark is nice. He can't care of myself. There's all these things going on. Chona, you're not- bad, or mean, or angry, or a , because that's what people like to call you, not you per se, but women, when they act the way that they want to act, you're not doing anything wrong. If you say, don't like this, it's burning me out. I may not even get to growing the lean business if you just crash and burn. So how about we put some guardrails on this, and we say, I'll do five, maybe 10 lean patients a day, 50 max, and I will do my charting day of, and I will agree to that. And I catch up, catch up this weekend, and just put the walls on it that actually works so that you can't get burned out. And then if you're still getting burnt out after that, you really need to have a heart to heart with yourself about what you're doing.
00:30:48 - Chona Sweet
So, right, that makes sense on the five patients a day, because I feel like right now, that's what I have, but I compacted. Monday, Tuesday, which gives me more free time on Wednesday, Thursdays, and Fridays to put in and also it's hard. I feel like I cannot Go fully tell him that oh, I'm just gonna do the lean because that we don't have a Lot of lean patients yet.
00:31:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, okay, pause pause again This is an issue with you feeling like you owe him something or you're gonna please him or something. Hold on Let me see this all the way through You're building a business the business not there. That doesn't mean like, you know, if you let's say you open up a store and you're like well I'm not gonna I don't know what it is, but let's say you just open up a practice and it's a doctor's practice And you're there But like I'm not gonna be here because there's no people you're gonna stay there and and do the job You do what's there the lean business is the perfect reason that you're that If that didn't exist, would you even be doing any business with Dr. E if that wasn't a potential?
00:32:05 - Chona Sweet
No, I wouldn't.
00:32:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so your logic doesn't really make sense and because to me that's like guilt and you feel compelled like you're supposed to do something to please somebody else.
00:32:21 - Chona Sweet
He did verbalize it to me to mark that yeah, that he needs help with the clinic.
00:32:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, he can hurt people. How is that your problem? Now you guys, you can fix me.
00:32:35 - Chona Sweet
I'm coming at it.
00:32:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is this is what I do. If I'm wrong, tell me I'm wrong.
00:32:40 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, there's some good news in all this because I talked to Dr. E was yesterday because he's bringing on two more hospitals. He understands children prefer his hospital over clinic practice that this is not a surprise to him because she does. She really enjoys the hospital setting and they probably like her if she likes it then. Dr. He's one of the guys where it's just yeah, whatever like he's.
00:33:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I mean the patient.
00:33:04 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So Are you kidding me like they love her right? Okay, so keep going sounds good be I mean The goal is to get her to be primarily hospital link right this right Maybe one day a week because five a day wouldn't make her run around more where it would be efficient got it week And clinic would make more sense. Okay, you can see everyone a single day and use the clinic because I grew it You got to be used to clinic. You're gonna do lean treatment. I Put this is like when I started my firm like you kind of got to go through You don't necessarily like to reach the brass ring that you're going for it's short-term pain for long-term payoff But he definitely is drowning in the clinic But that being said he will take whatever lifeboat he can get at the moment Because he just needs whatever helping you get but it's still his boat chona.
00:33:59 - Chona Sweet
This is what I need you same.
00:34:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's his vote to manage. So if you want to help, help under your terms in a way that does not burn you out, but then let him handle the rest of it and be a grown- man. don't mean it disrespectfully to Dr. E. I'm using hard language because I need it to be very clear because your language, you dodge things a little bit and it's not to your benefit. I'm trying to, this is not just you by the way.
00:34:35 - Chona Sweet
Yes, yes.
00:34:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Other people do this. We do this. want to be peacemakers and find the thing and sometimes the truth is uncomfortable. But you have so much power in you and it's, I definitely feel, I'm sorry, it's okay.
00:34:54 - Chona Sweet
I definitely feel not confident and not comfortable with my lean. notes and it's frustrating to um rely on mark to correct it.
00:35:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you remember the driving analogy?
00:35:10 - Chona Sweet
Yes.
00:35:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're not going to get comfortable until you have a certain amount of experience under your belt and you have to either be okay with that or let it ruin you.
00:35:21 - Chona Sweet
And also like I have a lot of question because I'm seeing the patients. I'm writing the preliminary notes but Dr. E is signing it and then I ask Mark about this. Like should we write something in the bottom saying initially seen by nurse practitioner? I don't know.
00:35:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like should I ask the questions? Are you are you do you have access to ask the questions?
00:35:46 - Chona Sweet
Like if you have a question can you ask Mark can you ask anybody that you need to? Yeah no I asked him he said no I don't need to I don't know Dr. E just accept whatever I do and I don't want him been trouble. I don't want us to be in trouble because it's it's it's all Dr. East, but he's not seeing the patient I am. So can you handle emotional discomfort very well? Not very well.
00:36:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you want to be able to handle emotional discomfort?
00:36:21 - Chona Sweet
I feel like I do, but not probably. I feel like that's a very well.
00:36:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you want to have emotional discomfort? means when it comes, do you want to be able to handle it and work through it so it doesn't dominate you?
00:36:37 - Chona Sweet
Yes, of course.
00:36:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Okay. The only way to get there? That's a muscle. That muscle, you know how hypertrophy works, right? Tear, heal, grow. It's hypertrophy that you need to have happening in you on an emotional level. This is uncomfortable. It's going stay uncomfortable, the only way to get comfortable is to continue to do it. And to do it consistently, it will happen fastest with the most consistency. And I will say in addressing the issue, so if you get an unsatisfactory answer, you need to push for more specificity. So if you can't get it from go to mark, and then you remind us to look, you guys, we're in business. I'm the one that has to do this thing, and I, I'm not going to do it. If I don't feel confident that I'm doing it right, my brain doesn't work that way. I will stress myself out to death if I can't feel confident in it. So maybe there's some level of discomfort I have to deal with, but at the very least, you can give me an accurate, clear answer, and I don't care. Nobody gets to give you and I don't care.
00:37:57 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, I definitely. It's the amount of confidence Dr. E is putting on me, it is, you know, it's definitely scary because I would do the notes. Do you care about your job? Yes.
00:38:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You try really hard.
00:38:20 - Chona Sweet
Not hard enough, baby.
00:38:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
how it asks you. I said do you try really hard?
00:38:25 - Chona Sweet
I think I try hard.
00:38:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you know anybody that does any job perfectly?
00:38:29 - Chona Sweet
No.
00:38:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, are you holding yourself to unrealistic expectations?
00:38:40 - Chona Sweet
Not sure.
00:38:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a few things that we have to work here. The biggest thing, this is a loop. We're caught in a loop right now. This is your lack of confidence and your first with the finances and because you're comparing apples to right now, the other job you had and how much it made versus this job plus the potential with also you like the hospital work but not the clinic work. So you've got all these things and those things are causing you to not show up. You not showing up is causing you to not get good at the things which will give you confidence. The only way through this is for you to make a firm decision period and then show up regardless of what it feels like. Do you have the ability to force yourself to do that and if the answer is yes the things have to change first. Do you have the fortitude to make the changes even if you feel uncomfortable by leaving him hanging because he needs more help.
00:40:06 - Chona Sweet
Yes, the answer is yes. I can do that.
00:40:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:40:11 - Chona Sweet
In your words then, what can you Um, well, I wanted to do continue the hospital to telemedicine and limit the time.
00:40:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, like one day a week, like Mark was saying, so you're not driving there so often.
00:40:37 - Chona Sweet
Right now it's two days a week, right now it's Monday, Tuesday.
00:40:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, cutting it down just Monday helped you out. Make a difference.
00:40:45 - Chona Sweet
I think it will. I will have to tell him about it.
00:40:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm going teach you about energy sandwiches.
00:40:53 - Chona Sweet
Because right now they, they schedule a way in advance.
00:41:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you're going to have to get through that, but I'm going to tell you this really quick for your difficult conversation, okay? Before you have to go do something that really, really, really sucks, do something that you really, really like in kimbooster energy, could be your favorite song, if there's a song that comes on and you can't wiggle, there's like a billion of those for me, put that on. If it's eating something, if it's going outside, if it snuggles, it does not matter what it is. If there is something that fills you up and makes you feel good, do that first, and then plan for something good, also like it, especially if it's physical. Physical activities are very good for helping to get stress out of the body, a workout, but any good physical activity of a husband, I'll let you be creative. I'm just telling you, it's important to understand the ways to manage stress and difficult things. When you're growing through difficult periods and you have to do uncomfortable things, it's really important to be conscious about what you're doing before. or after because you can help yourself get through those things without residual stress, which helps prevent or alleviate existing burnout. You're already burnt out. This is a danger zone. I do everything I can in all of my stuff to prevent burnout. All of the systems that I create, all of the processes I create are to prevent burnout because once it happens, and businesses crash, people quit, relationships go to crap, all kinds of bad things happen. Burnout is really dangerous on a physical level, on a stress level. It keeps psychiatrists and psychologists in business. It's a big thing and you're here right now. So the only way to get this is to power through it. But there are tools that you can give to kind of stack the depth for you. And it's just being conscious of the things that physically in a moment can Boost your energy like without fail. It might be sabotage to go eat cheesecake before you go have a difficult conversation But if that conversation is life-altering and it's gonna change the course of your career one cheesecake I'm gonna kill you. Don't tell my doctor. said that I have diabetes, but whatever. I Don't care I use tools. I use energy so sunshine when the Sun is out I am a bear in the winter. struggle so bad because I'm so affected by the weather today I napped for hours and I didn't want to because it was slushy like when when Whenever the weather's like that the black oak hurt and I don't even know it's bad and I still feel different Anyway, energy is really important and you have to manage it and it will help you mentally Be able to get over things you have to put things in the parameters that will work for you and Stop doing it because you feel like you have to do something you have a conversation with Mark like does it? to be like this. What happens if I do this? Not, will he be mad? Not will I not be helping enough? That that's not your job. Your job is to go bring in a new source of income. Inside of that, there are things that you need to know. You need to know how to work in his office. You need to know how to do the charting correctly for the liens because it's a legal issue versus just, you know, but if you know that you love the hospital and he's got patients that you can be helpful with air, if you know that you're understanding the clinic enough that as the lien patients come in, you're going to do a good job. And in the beginning, you can spend extra time with Mark, any other doctor that can help you out, make sure that you're covering everything right. Then you need to trust that over time, it's going to be like driving the car. All of these scary decisions that you have to mentally process are just going to be automatic.
00:44:57 - Chona Sweet
Great.
00:44:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But... But it starts with getting up, going to work, catching up on your part and not getting behind. If you have, you catch yourself getting behind, then have a threshold where like if I'm 20 behind, if I'm 30 behind, I don't go anywhere, I don't sleep in, don't anything until I've caught up. Like created, I don't know what the number is, I just were out of number, but you need to create that because here's what you need to remember is that if you get over a threshold, you will burn out. It just will happen. There will be a burnout threshold. You've already hit it. So keep all of those things in mind. And then the other thing I need you to know is that I think we were together good. really like it. But if I need you to do the assignments, so like sending me the wins, I'll tell you the reason that I ask for them is because of energy. want you to focus on something good at the end of today. I want to purposely shift your energy to something that you're happy about. Right. Just because I asked now, if you said, Tina, I don't want to do that, we wouldn't do it. You didn't. You just didn't do the work. And I'll give you an example. So I used to ask Mark to do a gratitude journal. And we talked about talked about and he didn't do it. And he's like, I don't really want to do that. That's not my thing. Like, okay, he's like, but this is what I am doing. I'm taking Dolce for a walk and we go for walks in the morning. And you know, so he came up with his own system that helps affect his energy that worked for him. So you don't need to follow anybody blindly. That is not going to be where you find the most joy or success. It's where you go, okay, I see the concept. I think for some value in that, but that system that you're coming up with, Tina, that doesn't work for me. How about we do this or how about I do that. Like I want you to drive. I'm here to facilitate not to drive. Does that make sense?
00:47:08 - Chona Sweet
Right. It does. I think I'm definitely not good and I tell Mark and I don't tell you. That's that's the difference. And I tell him like my wins. I was we were just talking when I was driving and I said this is what happened today. This patient said this and this to me. There's positive and negatives and I'm taking the positives. So I'm not good in telling you that but I do tell Mark. And I do like the sending voicemas. Sometimes though I get so I feel bad sending you late late at night.
00:47:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know. No I put everything in.
00:47:57 - Chona Sweet
Do not disturb.
00:47:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can send me anything you want to. Anytime.
00:48:00 - Chona Sweet
Okay, because I, I'm sure there are those messages before that it was so late.
00:48:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, you've never thought of me.
00:48:08 - Chona Sweet
I'm surprised that you respond sometimes.
00:48:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, I have teenagers, so we sleep when we sleep. Also, I was born an insomniac. I'm not an insomniac. actually sleep really good, but I'm a, I wake up at night. can be exhausted all day for three days in a row. I can exercise. can do everything to wear myself out and be exhausted around 10 o'clock.
00:48:31 - Chona Sweet
My body goes, let's go.
00:48:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's annoying.
00:48:34 - Chona Sweet
You, you mentioning that that actually is something I needed to say is ever since I start working there long ago now. Is it one and a half month, huh? I started September, but one and a half month, I wake up at three and four and I know when that happens, I'm stressed out. So I think, and then I try to sleep more.
00:48:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
can't, that's why I'm sleeping in. You know that that's when quarter
00:49:00 - Chona Sweet
All peaks two to three o'clock in the morning.
00:49:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you also know that one of the biggest reasons that happens is late nine meals? I learned that recently.
00:49:09 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, I've been eating bait because sometimes I would finish my charting 11, 30, 12.
00:49:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I actually forced myself to sleep. So one of the things that I learned is that if you just take like a 20-minute walk after whenever you eat, even if you're just walking in place and pacing around the house, I know that because I do that. It can offset that cortisol spike at two or three o'clock in the morning, which generally is combined with a potty break because the cortisol empties your bladder. I don't know if you know that but that happens a lot.
00:49:42 - Chona Sweet
So that happens even when I fast. do fasting sometimes. do long fasting and that happens even with that. So I think you're right. It's just that I feel, I do that when I'm grieving Yeah
00:50:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I'm stressed out so it's I would back it back to energy management and stress management and knowing yourself and doing whatever just Do you do like do you know what actually it calms you and makes you peaceful? Is there anything that you know of that? I just do that.
00:50:20 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, I just playing and by doing nothing Just doing this What are you doing when you're laying in bed, but I would read stories or I would do tik-tok just mindless And I want something funny. I want to laugh like I would When I when I see something funny and then I read the comments that makes me laugh So I laughing is is very good for me.
00:50:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm a big snuggler snuggler's work for me But there's only one person and he's in Arizona So I don't get that access a lot my my grandbaby though. I got to hold her that would do it for me Um, when it's summertime being out in the pool. I'm that's so happy. When I get lots of sunshine, I'm very happy. um, massages, my masseuse is amazing. Um, she does reflexology. That's something, but you could also, you know, I don't know when's the last time you went to the doctor and had your lab checked, had your personal levels checked.
00:51:19 - Chona Sweet
Have you thought about me doing that? Sure.
00:51:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
know.
00:51:23 - Chona Sweet
I know where the worst patients, I know this mark. I remember when meeting Mark long when we first met, I went the one like encouraging him and pushing him on to seeing his doctor and do this, do that, get, get your vaccines. then now he's very good in taking care of himself. And then I am not so amazing in these lives that I've worked with.
00:51:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, not because of me.
00:51:52 - Chona Sweet
I mean, I've just watched it is what I mean. Yeah, I know he's very good in taking care of himself and, you know, that's commendable. But you probably want you to take care of yourself, too, right? I Don't want to say that I'm giving myself grace and isn't you know in during this grace period But I I feel like I am in that grace 90 day period of this new place When you're building a business, it's it's grit that you need more than grace and Now look Right, it's a shift of mindset. I'm not I feel like I'm not totally there yet This is the first time I'm doing this and I feel It's not fully shifted my my mindset and Can I ask you a question that Just ask me okay Do you talk your do you are you good at talking your way out of things and have you done that your whole life? Oh, yeah, you think you're doing that now, right? I'm rationalizing why why I do what I do or how I why I
00:53:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
what I feel. Is that getting you where you want to be?
00:53:04 - Chona Sweet
No, but I feel it's what I need at the moment to comfort myself.
00:53:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that goes back to you. Do you want to deal with be able to deal with emotional discomfort?
00:53:17 - Chona Sweet
I mean, that would be emotional comfort, but do you want to be able to deal with it? I feel like we've been dealing with it.
00:53:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
just don't know if it's the right thing. what just we're gonna have next week's call and if you think I'm right about anything, all I want you to do is just say you're right and just not explain it, not anything and just sit with it. It's really gonna suck. I want you to be able to sit with things being uncomfortable and not need to fix it or try to make a feel better. Will you do that with me next week?
00:53:57 - Chona Sweet
Okay.
00:53:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you see? any benefit in doing that?
00:54:01 - Chona Sweet
You mean, like, for example, what's you mean?
00:54:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, well, if I went through and looked at the notes from today's call, we can talk about multiple reasons, multiple issues that we brought up, and then you explaining what's happening. And I don't want you to do that. I want you to acknowledge, there's something that isn't going the way that adopt you, and just sit in it, and not explain it. Just let that sit there and not try to make it feel better. Does that doesn't make sense now? don't know. I probably didn't change it at all.
00:54:39 - Chona Sweet
That makes sense.
00:54:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's just practice. It's just acclimation. I am a type A perfectionist. I was picked on a lot, and also, firstborn daughter, so people pleaser. But also, I learned, because I'm a very angry abusive mom, literally abused me. And so I got really good with dodging the hand with my mouth by saying things to placate and please and excuse and to justify. And I'm also very smart, I'm good at doing that, but I was blessed to have people call me out of my crap. And because of them, I grew and I want to grow more than I want to be comfortable. I want to grow more than I want to be right. That wasn't always true because being wrong was so uncomfortable for me. It physically painful, I still get physical anxiety, I will replay everything I've said every day to everyone, even if they thought it was great and look at all the ways I did wrong. Still, I'm 48 years old. should not be... doing it. So now I do it way less than I used to. But there's still a lot of anxiety. And I feel like crying telling you about it. It's a physical, visceral response. Like I could hang up and just go cry for five minutes. And it's stupid to me. I don't want to do that. That's annoying. It's frustrating. I'm strong. And that crying would not keep me from doing the hard thing. But I'm like, I don't say the things that would make me uncomfortable or say all the things that made me uncomfortable. But Chona, there is so much liberation in being able to sit in emotional discomfort and being able to be wrong and being able to be exposed in wrongness and learn the ear with people who will be like, okay, so Mark and I work with Dan. Also, it happens with Mark. I'll say something and I'll be completely wrong. Just cool. is wrong, not understand something, Dan will just completely disagree with me. he'll make that sound, but he's not being disrespectful. He's just got his thoughts and his opinions, and it's a safe space. But because I was able to sit and not try to be like, why did you say this? no, I didn't mean that, you know, and try to make it better. I've learned that I can just be myself around people, but also I can ask difficult questions, or I can say some of my crazy thoughts. And a lot of times they're right, and they're good. And because I'm bold enough to do that, because I'm okay with being wrong, I get to have the joy and the experience of being bold, right? And I also get to have the learning experience of being wrong and being corrected quickly, or redirected, or instructed quickly. So, or you can just get a new perspective, because I'm willing to say things and be vulnerable. Most people don't like it. make a lot of people uncomfortable, especially my Sunday school teachers. Most of them can't stand me. that's okay. But because of that, I've just found my niche in this world and it's amazing because I felt hated all of my childhood and a good portion of my adulthood, especially I married somebody that treated me just like my mom did. So my point is is that the only way to get comfortable and to not feel trapped by emotional discomfort is just to kind of embrace it. But I can tell you like not many people can from experience the power of the contrast between being trapped by trying to avoid that discomfort and the power of just fully embracing it and asking difficult questions, making demands like, okay, I'm not going to work more than one day a week. And you know what, I'm only going to do one day a week every other week because I really don't like it. And I'm just going to take this whole week off like whatever whatever it is you've got to figure out what works for you. But trust that if you're managing it that way, you're going to be in your superpowers. That means like when you're at the hospital taking care of hospital people, you're going to be the best down nurse protection they've ever seen. And they're going to love you. And you're going to do amazing. And then when you do the lean patients, you're going to have more energy for that because you're not burning out with the other things that you don't want. Nobody is going to architect the ideal situation for you, but you can. You just have to be honest about what you're doing, why you're doing it. What you don't want to do, stop doing what you don't want to do or tell yourself, I'm going to, because it really is going to be the only way that I get to what I want to. But whatever it is, make sure that you're telling the same story all day, every day, or what you're going to have is this dissonance inside of yourself, and it's really going to rip at you.
01:00:22 - Chona Sweet
Understood.
01:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you think about that more than understood?
01:00:30 - Chona Sweet
I know that I'm not doing really good, I'm not 100% in. I feel that I'm just doing it because to show face right now, I could, myself, because to show face for myself. self. I know that I'm not consistent.
01:01:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you think you can have these?
01:01:07 - Chona Sweet
I know, I know I can be. just have to make that decision that I'm fully fully in. I mean, you know, yeah, I just feel I'm not there yet because I don't want to be. I'm not.
01:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's true. That's what that's what you need to do is be flexible.
01:01:34 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, I'm not decision that you're that you're in yet. Yeah, I thought I would be in and then I realized Oh, this is this is a lot of work. I don't write. I don't like this.
01:01:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So ask this question though Is there a way that you see where you can be in like maybe you only do clinics twice a month one day every other week? I know that might sound extreme to you and I don't know. that's reality. But what I'm asking you, is there a way that you can craft the situation?
01:02:06 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, I think I think I I think I've become money focus. And the reason why I say that is I noticed myself committing more to my lean patients in clinic patients. So I will work around, I will drive to wherever I set the page. For example, I called the patient and I gave them two options where they can go and they go far from Huntington Beach. They went there, they went to the south location. So I drove there no problem early, like 9.30, like I don't have a problem. So I noticed that I definitely lit up when I know that this is and make me more. I think that's where it's that. And I feel that the current one is it's not where it's at. That's why I don't like it. And that's the truth that as much as I say, I don't want to treat patients just because of the money. But the lean patient, it's hard not, it's hard not to admit that it is the truth.
01:03:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you could stop judging yourself and that's okay, that's what motivates you.
01:03:24 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, it does motivate me like, okay.
01:03:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so be okay with that. Practice being able to say the whole truth exactly as it is. I'm not insinuating your lying or anything. I'm saying is just that's emotional discomfort also to claim what you want and who you are and be okay with it.
01:03:47 - Chona Sweet
By the way, what I just told you is totally against my ethics would work. Because I don't, this is, and I've worked with, I work at Cedars, I work with UCLA. We were, I take care of whatever from homeless to Prince of Dubai or whatever. I know that's the one thing that I hate is, but I just need to say because I don't know why because it's it's it's against what it is that everybody is there is no such thing as altruism.
01:04:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'll tell you why if I do something just to make you smile and make you feel good, this side effect is going to be, I know I made you smile and feel good and it's boost to my ego and I get the joy of your energy. I know I get something back even if it's just feeling like I did something for you. There is no real pure altruism. We are all motivated by what we get back, whether we acknowledge it or not. Right. There are different currencies. Sometimes we get happiness back.
01:05:00 - Chona Sweet
we get comfort back. Sometimes we get a favor back.
01:05:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sometimes we get a paycheck, but we all receive a currency for our currency that we extend out to others. So then everybody's out of right?
01:05:17 - Chona Sweet
Or nobody is.
01:05:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Some people are just more honest about it than others. Let ask you one more thing. If you go and make a million dollars, are you going to keep it all to yourself?
01:05:29 - Chona Sweet
Are you going to spoil the people that you love? I mean both, definitely, because I would love to spoil, you know, if you, and then what did I get from that? go, I get what you're saying, but I guess what I'm trying to say is because when I used to work, I work as an employee in my mind. I'm just, I'm doing this because of my job, but not directly because I'm getting, it's hard to explain yourself that not what I'm going to tell you. Yeah, just the mindset, the shift on the business mindset is different. And I don't, Knowing if I'm if I'm overthinking it Judging yourself.
01:06:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's what you've been doing with everything. You're judging your handwriting You're judging your language. You're judging your motives, and you need to stop that If you want to be happy You've got to just embrace who you are and know that other people are blessed for knowing you this guy loves you Like there's got to be something good about you. Your patients love you Your family loves you, I would assume You just being you I mean not all families, but so Just love you and be okay with that and know that You getting what you want and what energizes you and motivates you makes you a more potent version of you Makes you get more good things done Whatever the children of things are you're gonna be more empowered because you're gonna Stop being held down by a judgment and direction and shame and doubt.
01:07:02 - Chona Sweet
Right. Right. I could. I could do a lot more with being having a routine and having time management because controlling my own schedule is the best and that more thing that can happen to me.
01:07:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
01:07:23 - Chona Sweet
So we can talk about that, but ultimately you're the only one who can do anything about it.
01:07:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. It has to be a bigger thing other than I'll be more productive if I have a better schedule. have bigger reasons. You'll sleep better. You'll probably make better decisions because we know cognitive function drops when you're tired and exhausted. You'll be more healthy, more consistent. The close levels will be more level, which means your cravings will be more level, which means your energy levels will be more level. Like if there's, if you want to sit there and have lots of conversations to try to motivate yourself, we could do that. the end of the day, it's going to come down to rob discipline.
01:08:04 - Chona Sweet
Right.
01:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The discipline is a muscle. You work it slowly, you grow it slowly. It doesn't happen all at once.
01:08:13 - Chona Sweet
And almost always, it looks like this. Right. Mark wakes up very early and well, initially for Dolce, but you know, even without Dolce, still wakes up early.
01:08:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you guys are opposite like circadian rhythm types.
01:08:33 - Chona Sweet
Right. I'm work, I sleep late, I woke up late. I mean, even if I sleep early, I woke up 3, 4 a.m. then I sleep in again.
01:08:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And there's not a solution to everything when it comes to sleep and schedules. Some of it is just rough. That's life. We can't solve for everything.
01:08:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
All sort of saying, I am for me in our office.
01:08:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If I want to sleep in late, I really couldn't. Yeah, so what I want you to think about is what can you be the architect of what can you change and I don't mean just yourself like Did I have your read that book switch?
01:09:12 - Chona Sweet
No, I haven't that's fine.
01:09:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will power.
01:09:16 - Chona Sweet
I need you to read that book. I have it on like audible That's another thing we've talked about that you said you were doing didn't do it. need.
01:09:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah um, I said you'd like to read at night.
01:09:28 - Chona Sweet
It's relaxing No, it's I listen to I like listening to the books.
01:09:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I start listening to the 48th, but that I wasn't able to Complete it do you switch because it's how to make change when change is hard Right and it's entertaining. They did a good audible version.
01:09:46 - Chona Sweet
It's very good. So I would say though that in terms of Cheryl I think we were able to go past the resist I mean in a way because now for example the two patients that comes in they emailed me first we are only two months in by the way that's pretty good yeah they emailed me first and then i see see her and then the other person that you know is in charge with the lien it's cast and Cheryl i emailed them so they're part of that loop of email with this case manager of this lawyer so and it's been work i send them the the notes and then cast send the bill of she sent my name on the bill as a provider or as the medical provider i told her changes make it dr e which she did it it worked so it you know architected that you know saying you did it your way right i wanted that yeah she she said she said no tell them to email me it's like no no no no that's not how it's going to work but also i've become i i you know she we just celebrated her but at her birthday the other day and I was there. I'm showing up for the other non-work part. I really wanted to be okay with not just with her but everyone. I don't know about pug stuff, was cute. Yeah, he's a dog person.
01:11:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So he got her a pug. That's a good thing.
01:11:21 - Chona Sweet
like dog people.
01:11:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know she's four not dog people.
01:11:25 - Chona Sweet
She's never met a person who's not a dog person that I liked. She works hard too. think she realized now that okay I'm not trying to take away or be not including you. She's included on everything that I do.
01:11:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's really good growth in two months.
01:11:43 - Chona Sweet
So I feel good about a lot of the things that are happening but and also if you're not okay well that was that's a test um but
01:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do. I we have to get, um, you know, anyway, we talk about pacing, but also looking at the clock and I think somebody's got plans tonight.
01:12:10 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yes, we do very pretty soon, but this is really, really, really important because it's or get off the pot kind of type situation. You know, those when I use language like that. We have a prostitution analogy today.
01:12:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh, but you're not serious. I already had to apologize to God today.
01:12:30 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Anyway, either here nor there. Next up, these things about me anyway. I think for tell me if I'm wrong, but this seems like what you want to do because you understand how it's different than what you were doing before in terms of what your long-term potential is and correct me if I'm wrong because I think what's in this saying and I don't mean to speak for you again, but if you were much happier what you were doing before and you want to be handcuffed or only earning a certain amount. you are able to physically show up and not have the flexibility that you want or the ability to make more money, but do you have to work differently and harder? There's nothing wrong with that. It's just admitting to yourself, this is what I want. And I know I nudged you in this direction pretty hard, but if this isn't what you want, it's better to say now than in a year from now.
01:13:23 - Chona Sweet
Mm-hmm. I think it's definitely hard for me not to compare, especially when I'm feeling tired and I feel like I'm doing much more work as compared to that. And I'm not even touching the potential business potential, earning potential, the other earning potential, but I'm understanding or I'm accepting that it's part of it. It's part of it, I guess.
01:13:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just, so here's what I want like, you know, Ponderon is being the architect, okay? So when you tell yourself something about what you have to do, I want you to ask yourself, but is that true? What is actually true and what else could be true? Because sometimes opposing truths exist and it's difficult to understand how they can because it exceeds our reasoning, right? But we can sense, there seems to be evidence that this truth is true and this truth is true, but how they don't make sense. So think about, is there a way to change things so that it's not feeling like it's draining you? And also be the architect of the dialogue in your head. are you telling yourself? you catch yourself comparing the old jobs, Are you looking for a way to talk yourself out of doing your work or justifying not doing your work or making yourself comfortable with an uncomfortable situation, and ask yourself the things that I want is what I want most to make myself feel better about how I'm doing, or do I want to get to this thing and be able to deal with discomfort for a little while. So think about this conversation a little bit. If you want to send you the notes, don't know if you would read it and go back over it and look at some of the highlights, or I could just give you the bullet points of these are the things that kind of contemplate that we were talking about today. And here's the thing when you're when you're going through a growth period, your perspective shifts. I can't think of the word that I want right now. It's just I feel like my blood sugar is one of my crazy. hold on.
01:15:58 - Chona Sweet
Anyway, it's too much.
01:16:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're dark, but that's also, um, um, you change drastically, your perspective changes drastically, you're operating from a different standpoint, your motives and your opportunities are shifting. Um, in your perspective is shifting and part of it is allowing yourself to be honest and just say, I'm motivated by money as a healthcare worker. Fuji, I'll give you an example. I don't think he would be upset that I said this, but I asked him, you know, so why do you become a doctor? He's like, money, he's like, like, you know, he's like, I shouldn't say this, but the truth is it was a path to financial freedom and I felt like it was leverage and it's what I want. And so, you know, I talking, you know, and taking a path because I think his motives and M.O. is this, but it's really here. So just be honest, you're not the only one and I will tell you what this world would be screwed if it wasn't for the capitalistic types because they're the visionaries that actually change everything because they're honest about it and they understand psychology because they're honest about it and they're not trying to say one thing and be another. Let yourself be that way. Think about all the good that you're doing being just exactly as you are.
01:17:37 - Chona Sweet
By the way, when I say that I like the money that makes me feel bad, but at the same time, it makes me feel bad that I feel bad about it. I don't know if I added that. I want to have that mind shift of I want to make more money because I can see in Mark, but I can see in Dr. E. They have a different look in them. It's hard to articulate, but it's like, it's the business people in them like, oh, I'm doing it.
01:18:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you ever read the book at this fund?
01:18:13 - Chona Sweet
No, what is that? You said, you said, at it, do you have the hand ran book?
01:18:24 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yes. Let me ask you a question then before we finish, because you were with so many people in all different stations in business from startups to very established businesses to people taking over for someone who and different education and class levels like, yeah, especially the ones who are just starting or have shifted, right? How often do you see it in a slingshot where there feels like they're running through the mud? feels like they're running through the mud hitting their head against the wall. So close to quitting and then just one. Hey, it feels like one day. It's not different in your way ahead.
01:19:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Almost every time, but I will tell you that there is one commonality between all of them, and that's consistency. I don't see it and people who don't show up consistently. I see those people fail and sabotage without exception. I have seen people hear me, acknowledge the truth, and show up consistently for the first time in their lives, really, for the hard things. I have seen that. I do believe it can happen, otherwise I would quit with people as soon as I see they don't show up regularly. It for sure is in there. And I would tell you what the litmus test is. had it tonight. It's talking about it. And when I ask you to not make excuses or anything, you're just like, okay, Most, anybody else that isn't going to do the work will still argue there. You didn't. So I have hope for you, but I will tell you that that catapult slingshot comes from consistency. So what you do is you build up tension. It's a compounding effect. And you have done all the things and it's almost like driving the driving lessons again. Only the difference is you're revving the engine right there and pretty soon you get to let off the gas and just go. And it in my favorite way of looking at that is a one year period. So for Mark, let's use Mark as an example. He is always the slingshot. He will just will be talking about talking about talking about things like Mark, when you're going to do this, when you're going to do this, let's just give up and stop bugging him for a little while or whatever. You'll be thinking about something and it just will piss him off and he'll just be like this driving he does I'm gonna go fix this and then he'll go into a deep dive and He'll find a solution and he'll fix it. I didn't do any of it. I'm a facilitator. Sometimes I'm a catalyst, but I don't really fix anything Sometimes I show the solution like chat GBT or cloud AI or something But really that's not the solution. It is the visionary It's the one is like, you know what what I could do and then they they get to work at it And he does that and the the pace of that is probably every several months that there's a slingshot type effect but there's one at least every year and What I was about to say was I like the Looking back over a year because I can always find a look at this Like look at this that happened to look at this that happened There's always if you think you can stack and go wow like we didn't have that last year That's pretty awesome and then it can also go I can look at some of the conversations that we had that ended up being the catalyst for that.
01:22:04 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So, two months we did that today when we're looking at the year of, you know, we're signing things, we're looking at December and you see, like, go to the top, and then, like, pop. But it was constantly, like, running into a wall doing stuff. don't like to do repeatedly. Yes.
01:22:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
know. don't like doing Like, you know what? You're right. I just got to do it, and you go do it, and it's amazing. And the growth, I mean, so sweet law, when we started, we were getting about 32, 30 retainers a month on average. And now, we're anywhere from, like, 82, we've had 100, over 100, or 100.
01:22:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
01:22:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Lorenz, we've been working with Lorenz for, it's been six months now, but his 30 days, we've taken his average. of closing the cases to 30 days in six months and considering Lorenz's normal pace is sloth. I mean it with respect.
01:23:10 - Chona Sweet
really like him. He's a big sloth. He's huge.
01:23:15 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He just moves slowly. He's very just very slowly and that's not a knock on him. It's just how he is and that's okay. But what's he saying like he now knocked off 10% of what he's doing which means he will make more money. He will be less stressed out. But it took you three, four, five months to get him to that point.
01:23:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I actually started seeing the change in August when I was looking at the reports. It was very slow. It was about 10 days. So I would say about every two months there was a 10 day kind of shift and I didn't know how much confidence I felt in it like I was talking about today. I'm like I don't know how much of a difference it actually makes. But that's the thing perspective, personalities, body, these chemistry, childhood trauma, it all comes into the mix, which is why I take holistic approach to it and don't like take a Harvard business process to it.
01:24:12 - Chona Sweet
Just doing all that coffee is not good still.
01:24:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, but the thing is I love what I do and I didn't always and that changed everything. It changed how much I earned. It changed how much I earned per hour because that when I became more joyful in it, I had more energy to go study, to read more books, to hone my craft, to develop my systems a little bit better and bring them back to my people. If you spend more time in the hospital, less time in the places that are draining you, that could be a potential benefit that maybe you haven't thought about because you haven't had the perspective of, I give myself permission to build the business that I want to build, the way that I want to build it, knowing that I will go bless others if I build
01:25:00 - Chona Sweet
business that blesses me. Right and I actually love that part that yes wanted to make more money I want to see more patients because I get paid for patient but at the same time I as compared to how I was in the past I've been very much open and grateful to appreciation when patients express oh I want to like today I want to talk to the nurse practitioner who I talked to last month because I want to thank her that is me you talk to me and yeah no thank you the procedure that you recommended I did it and it worked my pain is over 70 percent better so again I have a patient the other day like I need your card because I want to make sure it's a hospital patient I want to make sure that they keep you I just had an epiphany because you're talking about you know the lean patients and it making you money but that's the hospital doesn't make you more money right?
01:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
doesn't I get paid stick would be real quick because we're going to close this up and I think Oh, I remember you telling me that what you liked about the oh actually maybe it's the other way around in the hospital you can give them the treatments that they need or is it in the clinic in the hospital it's quick instant relief and I tell I can see it the next day like today like multiple times I gave something or I did something and then they're much better the next day and they go home early that was it so part of what I think makes you happy is you actually get to help people feel better so yeah so but I want you to remember that that is a motivator for you or you wouldn't like the hospital so much right though you taking care of people is very important to you making them feel good and be better is very important to you it's okay that it's also true that making more money and not doing tedious charting is something that you
01:27:00 - Chona Sweet
I'd better.
01:27:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's okay for you to be nuanced and complicated. You're a woman.
01:27:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
But I don't remember any time you come home from the site hospital.
01:27:11 - Chona Sweet
No, I honestly don't know.
01:27:14 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's true that was thankful to you. Or that you saw this and the pain went away because of your recommendation.
01:27:21 - Chona Sweet
And in the last month, there's been four, five, six.
01:27:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is really good column. That's really good column.
01:27:29 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Money exactly the same. And you had to work a little bit harder with the hospital stuff, but you got that sense of joy.
01:27:37 - Chona Sweet
Yeah. No, the patient.
01:27:40 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
up with it.
01:27:41 - Chona Sweet
Even Tina, she saw you light up with it. It's a completely different change with you. Yeah.
01:27:46 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
you know, this bag, you get all excited.
01:27:50 - Chona Sweet
Well, the one who I talked to today is a phone call. Yes, it's longer. I talk to them every month. But patients light up if I give them their We feel which of narcotics, which is fine, whatever, but this is different when they say hey, know, you know, you really think you or, you know, I don't know.
01:28:11 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
They've been trying to sell their pain and they've been trying to get someone to help them and you help them solve an issue that's been killing the sickle cell person talking about where watching it off, you spent time to figure out a solution that actually helped them.
01:28:22 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, whether the black patient because that's not neglected even there. Yeah, yeah, no, I have a, I have a little bit of a bias with sickle cell patients because I, it's a painful disease and they get very dependent to it and they were dubbed as seeking because their pain is not controlled.
01:28:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I just, why people don't understand it that's why I'm serious medicine and a lot of treatments where you'll find the greatest innovation is where the people with the money. have experienced it and so they've innovated in that particular area. It's not even a racist thing. That's just that that's just the reality.
01:29:09 - Chona Sweet
So anything. Yeah, no, it's true. That's why you know, not a lot of people like what I do. lot of people I talk to like, why are you in pain? Is this deal with the patients who are in pain and they're addicts and they're they're it's.
01:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My sister works in a methadone clinic.
01:29:24 - Chona Sweet
Did I tell you that? Yeah, you did told me not everyone not everyone likes to work even psych patients. And I have a, you know, I know, Marcus, it's very, very hard on me. I take in a lot of of it, but I feel bad for them. everyone wants to help them.
01:29:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's it's sad, you know, but that's all the more reason why that by the way, the skill of being able to sit in negative energy and not let it be taken in is a really important skill.
01:29:56 - Chona Sweet
Yeah.
01:29:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's not deflecting it. It's letting it be there, but not letting absorb and impact you, right?
01:30:05 - Chona Sweet
Right.
01:30:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's something that I can help you with. God put me through it from infancy. So that was a skill that I got to develop. But you have so much to give. I really want you to practice not judging yourself and just being able to speak openly about how you feel about things. Yeah. And ask, you know what, can this be done in a different way that I actually like? Yeah. And understanding that you liking something is not being petty or impetuous or anything like that. It's you managing energy. And with you having maximized energy, first of all, better quality life, better quality relationships, but also better quality service. Your brain works better. thoughts will be more creative. You'll be more powerful and potent in all ways. Right. need to justify making the way that you want to. It's because you'll bring better everything to every table.
01:31:04 - Chona Sweet
You go to right Yeah, I know like I always feel better when I talk to you I'm glad because I did so much.
01:31:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

01:31:20 - Chona Sweet
I appreciate them honesty because it's what I needed, you know when I need it I know I'm not I know I there's a lot of things I need to do it's just a matter of me.
01:31:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's you baby wanting to do it.
