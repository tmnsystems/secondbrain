## Quote 1

> I hope that you can find some value in these things and grow in power, purpose and peace yourself. üíô -end post- I‚Äôm Tina Marie, and I‚Äôm a business consultant that has helped several startups grow to million dollar businesses within a year, and others to multi-million dollar companies in under three years from their inception. To tell you how I got here, I‚Äôd have to go back a good 30+ years. I was entrepreneurial and geeky from the beginning. At 8, I was learning how to write programs in BASIC on a Radioshack TRS80 (think floppy disk and cassette tape drives... oh yeah!) Lemonade stands were a little too social for my taste, back in the day, so at ten, I was mowing lawns and babysitting. By 11 I had a paper route and made a good $65 a month. From that point on, if I wanted something, I was the one who made it happen. I worked in fields picking crops with migrant workers. I worked in school cafeterias and then hustled my way into a job at a Law office as a 16 year old runner for 5 local attorneys when I had decided I wanted to go into law. I managed to get a full ride to college and then quit.. Three times before quitting for good, when I realized I couldn‚Äôt stand the agendas and propoganda that came with the education. Instead, I found a way to get paid to learn, and started working in a call center that housed tech giants like Intel, Apple, Adobe and the likes. While I started as a technician, I rapidly moved up the ranks to account management during my 6 years there. I learned that I have a knack for improving any environment I worked in via optimization. My systems saved jobs and accounts before I even realized the power of what I had created. After the birth of daughters, I decided to figure out how to replace my full time income from home. While I went down the ‚ÄúSQUIRREL!!!‚Äù path that most entrepreneurs find themselves on, realized I could take my existing skills and find a home for them online. I‚Äôve been growing companies as a secret weapon on the inside ever since... all while having the time to raise my girls, cook their meals, coach them in sports and do the things that matter most to me. And now... 16 years after starting online and 17 years after my first child, I‚Äôm sharing my systems with as many entrepreneurs as I can so that others can be as happy, fulfilled, and liberated as I am. Working smarter and not harder is not cliche... It‚Äôs an anthem to live by. Follow me, and I‚Äôll show you :) 1. Math is Your Friend 2. Start with ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù 3. Mindset 3.1 You Actually Are Expert Enough 3.2 Being Broke Helps No One 3.3 Why You and Not Some Other Expert 4. Pricing and Packaging 4.1 10% Rule of Thumb 4.2 Lead With Value 4.3 Map a Value Ladder 4.4 Don‚Äôt Overthink It 4.5 Your Core Offer 4.6 Upsells 5. Example Scenarios 5.1 Scenario One ‚ÄìLowballed 5.2 Scenario Two - Bump the Core Offer 5.3 Scenario Three - Bump in Price + Conversion 5.4 Scenario Four - Vip Pricing 5.5 Scenario Five - Double the Upsell Price 5.6 Scenario Six - Tripped Up 5.7 Scenarios Seven - Lower Upsell Price 5.8 Scenario Eight - Lower Core Offer Price 5.9 Scenarios Nine - More Please 5.10 Scenario Ten - High Roller 6. Bottom Line Table of Contents Math Is Your Friend. Chapter 1 Most entrepreneurs do not go into business because they love crunching numbers and balancing the books. It is impossible to tell someone you are not speaking to personally exactly how they should price and package their offers. This is my solution to that problem. I am going to give you ten customizable scenarios with different types of products and packages that you can plug into that should help you see what you can change to get more profits out of your business, with very little additional work other than creating the offers and writing them up. Most entrepreneurs get started because they are unsatisfied with the status quo in some way or another and find the only solution is to create their own paths. We venture out on it and learn as we go. And while there are tons of great programs that teach how to SELL or even WHAT to sell... There is very little spoken about how to package an offer and what prices to use to hit your goals. There is a reason for that... Start With ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù? Chapter 2 Why is it so hard to charge the right price? If they cannot do it at all... obviously you have value. If you can do it FASTER or BETTER than they can... you have verifiable value. When YOU are your product, how you value yourself has EVERYTHING to do with this struggle. Here are some things you need to consider in your mind when you figure out your value to your clients: Could they do will do for them, or as well or as fast as you could? Mindset. Chapter 3 You Actually Are Expert Enough. Chapter 3: Part 1 Most unpaid experts don‚Äôt yet consider themselves expert enough to charge money. Easy deal, right? That food is going to cost him money and time, and you‚Äôre okay with that, right? Why? Because you gave him value and you both know it. Well... when you‚Äôre giving value to a complete stranger who you are only interacting with through websites, text, videos and other marketing materials... even socially on the interwebs... Trading BBQ for your genius skills isn‚Äôt really going to pan out. And the bottom line is: If you don‚Äôt charge properly you will end up broke. If you know more than the average person does, and you can help them do something they could not do as fast or as well as you can help them to do, then you are expert enough to charge money. Money is simply the currency used to exchange value Look, let‚Äôs say your neighbor wants you to come help him on the computer because he‚Äôs a technoob and well, you‚Äôre awesome. But, because he‚Äôs your friend and lives next door... he doesn‚Äôt offer money, he offers to send you over some of his killer BBQ when he grills this weekend. Being Broke Helps No One. Chapter 3: Part 2 You are not going to be around to help anyone because you‚Äôre broke and depressed. But the economy needs you to contribute! You have a serious obligation to go out there and compete for business and serve YOUR MARKET. You know... the ones who don‚Äôt want to do business with that douchebag Steve who may be as good or even a little bit better at what you do, but isn‚Äôt worth the investment. Sound a little brutal? I know. But... YOU KNOW I‚ÄôM RIGHT. So stop arguing with me and with yourself and listen up. Getting paid properly is the way to feel free and happy AND it‚Äôs the way to ensure you have the resources you need to continue to hone your craft and offer your products and services to the marketplace. I don‚Äôt want this to go to your head or anything... Why You and Not Some Other Expert? Chapter 3: Part 3 There are a ton of reasons why people will want to pay you and not someone else. I don‚Äôt want to spend a long time on this so just think about how you‚Äôve chosen one person over another simply on feeling instead of value. If you show up and do the work, you can find a way to get a piece of the market. That‚Äôs my pep talk. If you need one on one advice, you can always some time with me for a little tough love. (Paid of course... I KNOW MY VALUE) Pricing and Packaging. Chapter 4 Remember, I don‚Äôt know exactly what you‚Äôre doing and what you‚Äôre offering or how good you are. If you feel like you‚Äôre not good enough to charge some of these prices... lower them. Then... improve your skills. That being said... Here‚Äôs a good rule of thumb to follow. If you‚Äôre offering one on one consulting time or ... 10% Rule of Thumb. Chapter 4: Part 1 Take the highest price you‚Äôre comfortable with charging and then ADD 10% to that price. Let‚Äôs talk about the different types of products and services you might offer. This is going to relate to digital products and virtual services. Any physical products could be added in as well... just remember to calculate your profit margins accordingly. Once you start getting sales at your price, incrementally increase your price by 5-10% for every new customer you take on until you stop getting conversions. DON‚ÄôT BE THE ONE TO TELL YOURSELF NO! Let your customers tell you what they will pay. *note ‚Äì correct pricing and packaging for value isn‚Äôt going to be enough if you don‚Äôt know how to pitch your offer. If pitching is hard for you, study the book called ‚ÄúPitch Anything‚Äù and work on that skill. It will serve you well in many areas of life to improve this one skill. Lead With Value. Chapter 4: Part 2 First of all, I‚Äôm a big believer in leading with value. I grow businesses in many different ways. One of them is helping entrepreneurs craft solid offers and clear their head trash so they can actually pitch them and make money. I found that is SUCH a common problem that I decided I would give as much help with that as possible, free of charge. Obviously, it would work better one on one... but this is a way I can serve my market and find potential leads. Do the same thing for your market. You‚Äôre reading my ‚Äúlead by example‚Äù version of that right now. I want you to get some value from me and KNOW I‚Äôm worth investing in before I ever ask you to invest. If I can‚Äôt do that, I‚Äôll probably not convince you I‚Äôm worth your time anyway and that‚Äôs just not a foundation I can build on. So find a way to create something of value for your market that you can give away. Create something that complements OR supplements what you already do. Map a Value Ladder. Chapter 4: Part 3 The next thing you will create to ascend them up your value ladder is a low level offer, sometimes referred to as a trip wire. You can have many different entry points into your marketing ‚Äúeco system‚Äù... it does not have to be simply linear... but for the sake of simplicity and what I like to focus on, ‚ÄúFastest Path to Cash‚Äù let‚Äôs consider a linear value ladder starting with free, to low cost and upwards. Your low cost product should be something that can solve ONE specific problem for them. It should be easily digestible within one to two hours and should allow them the ability to implement within a day. The price here is between $6-$20. There‚Äôs so many ways you can validate that is worth more than dinner for two. It may take you a while to think about why... but think it out.... Write up those bullet points and look at it. When you look at that and say ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a no brainer‚Äù... You‚Äôve got a winner. Don‚Äôt Overthink It. Chapter 4: Part 4 Remember to make it easily and quickly digestible and actionable! The problem you will want to solve is not so much how to give value, not if you know your stuff. It‚Äôs going to be more about demonstrating the value in a product they haven‚Äôt seen yet well enough to get them to part with their money. So focus on this part! Pretend it‚Äôs your best friend and you want them to understand why they HAVE to have this. You would tell them: ‚Ä¢ Benefit! ‚Ä¢ Benefit! ‚Ä¢ Benefit! ‚Ä¢ Benefit! ‚Ä¢ Benefit! What are the benefits of your product? Get CLEAR on that and making the pitch will be a lot easier, as will choosing the price. Your Core Offer. Chapter 4: Part 5 The next offer is going to be your core offer. This is the one that should bring you the majority of your income. All of your marketing and products will be leading up to THIS product or service that allows you to give max benefit to max audience size. My preference is that this is scaleable, so it‚Äôs a digital product or training that modulated and self-paced (online membership course etc) with possible weekly trainings, live videos, q and a etc inside of a group. This lets you leverage your time while being able to serve more people at a solid price point. Upsells. Chapter 4: Part 6 Upsells are not created to be just one more possible way to squeeze money out of a prospect. Once you‚Äôve shown them value at each level, they are much more likely to want more from you and be willing to pay higher prices if you continue to offer them what they want. Upsells are going to solve a problem that not everyone in your market need solved, but the ones who do need it solved understand the value of it. I‚Äôll use one of my own value ladders as an example: It has to be purposeful and make sense for your market. Keep this in mind... people that pay the least expect the most. It‚Äôs harder to sell people on free and $5 than it is to sell the RIGHT person on $200 or more. The person who‚Äôs focused on VALUE rather than dollars (no, they are not the same) is going to be willing to spend more. TripWire Offer ‚Äì Projects in a Box Pre-mapped out project templates for multiple business scenarios to help the ‚Äúorganizationally challenged‚Äù get organized fast. $17 per template Core Offer ‚Äì My Freedom Systems - $97 Four modules in a membership site teaching people Time management, Upsell 1 ‚Äì Group Coaching $199/month or $999 for 6 months (one month free) I offer 15 minute one on one calls twice a month and a weekly q and a call that‚Äôs recorded for all members of the group. Free Optin/Lead Magnet ‚Äì 10 Ways to $10k Upsell 2 ‚Äì Business Consultation Call $299 90-120 Minute call with me to create a clear plan for what‚Äôs next in the business to increase cash and freedom. RARE UPSELL ‚Äì I offer this to less than 1% of my audience Retainer client agreement. Price varies. They get weekly calls with me and I speak to them and their team to keep projects on schedule and optimize profits and time. I‚Äôll spend 1-5 hours a week with clients from $2500-$10,000 a month. It‚Äôs not for everyone. The ones who want it are the ones who make enough that my optimization skills validate the investment. Applying this to your offer. Think hard and DON‚ÄôT undervalue yourself. Okay... Here‚Äôs the worksheet to help you with some numbers and seeing HOW fast things can add up to $10k a month for you. Did I just hear you say ‚ÄúFinally!!!!‚Äù??? I better not have! I had to warm you up to know what to plug in there, Speedy Gonzales. Without context, the numbers don‚Äôt mean anything. If you got to this point and skipped the rest above... Slap yourself on the wrist! Then go back up and read it. The strategy is to segment what you offer into a value ladder that you can ascend your customers up through. Use benefit bullet points to help you figure out what a price is for these offers. Think about how much time and stress your product or service will save them. Use reference points like minimum wage hours worked vs. expert hours. If you gave them, effectively, an hour worth of your time, is that not worth twice minimum wage? Is it worth dinner for two? Is it worth ... Well... What is it worth? Example Scenarios. Chapter 5 Scenario One: Lowballed. Chapter 5: Part 1 Lowballed. When you‚Äôre too afraid to charge much... do you see how many sales you have to make in order to hit $10,000 a month? Ask yourself... is it harder to charge more and get fewer people to say yes or to charge less and get more people to say yes? Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $5 750 $3,750 Core Offer $20 150 $3,000 Upsell 1 $67 50 $3,350 Total Revenue $10,100 Scenario Two: Bump the Core Offer. Chapter 5: Part 2 Bump the Core Offer. Here, doubled the TripWire cost, but it‚Äôs still only $10. We bumped the Core Offer price $7 and left the upsell the same. Here‚Äôs the thing. With this offer, you need 315 LESS ‚Äúyes‚Äôs‚Äù to get to $10k a month. When you think about what‚Äôs harder... getting a yes or a yes at a few buck higher... usually it‚Äôs just the ‚Äúyes‚Äù that‚Äôs scariest. I told you... MATH IS YOUR FRIEND! Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $10 500 $5,000 Core Offer $27 100 $2,700 Upsell 1 $67 35 $2,345 Total Revenue $10,045 Scenario Three: Bump in Price + Conversion. Chapter 5: Part 3 Bump in Price + Conversion. Again... just a few tweaks to the price and now we need even less sales to hit that number. Something to think about is the percentage of conversions that take the offer. The higher you can increase your conversion rate from TripWire to Core Offer to Upsell, the more sales you get, the higher value each of your new customer becomes. As that happens, you can afford to invest more to acquire each new lead. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $12 475 $5,700 Core Offer $37 75 $2,775 Upsell 1 $67 25 $1,675 Total Revenue $10,150 Scenario Four: Vip Pricing. Chapter 5: Part 4 Vip Pricing. This is a powerful example of what happens when you have higher ticket offers available. With only TWO sales, you just added nearly $2k to your monthly revenue total. See how fast that can add up? Only two sales out of your 450 customers. Improve your conversion rate and that generates a lot more money very quickly. EXCITING, ISN‚ÄôT IT? Bet you wanna call up your old math teacher and thank them! Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $12 450 $5,400 Core Offer $37 45 $1,665 Upsell 1 $97 10 $970 Upsell 2 $997 2 $1,994 Total Revenue $10,029 Scenario Five: Double the Upsell Price. Chapter 5: Part 5 Double the Upsell Price. Here we upped the Core offer $20 and doubled the upsell price. Remember, these are mock scenarios just to give you an visual idea of what happens when just a few numbers change. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $12 300 $3,600 Core Offer $37 40 $2,680 Upsell 1 $197 15 $2,955 Upsell 2 $997 1 $997 Total Revenue $10,232 Scenario Six: Tripped Up. Chapter 5: Part 6 Tripped Up. Upped that TripWire and BOOM. More $$. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $20 275 $5,500 Core Offer $67 40 $2,680 Upsell 1 $197 5 $985 Upsell 2 $997 1 $997 Total Revenue $10,162 Scenario Seven: Lower Upsell Price. Chapter 5: Part 7 Lower Upsell Price. Some different price points. Lower Upsell prices need a few more front end sales, but not much. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $20 300 $6,000 Core Offer $67 40 $2,680 Upsell 1 $147 8 $1,176 Upsell 2 $497 1 $497 Total Revenue $10,353 Scenario Eight: Lower Core Offer Price. Chapter 5: Part 8 Lower Core Offer Price. Lowered the Core Offer price... still making $10k. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $20 300 $6,000 Core Offer $47 45 $2,115 Upsell 1 $147 10 $1,470 Upsell 2 $497 1 $497 Total Revenue $10,082 Scenario Nine: More Please. Chapter 5: Part 9 More Please. Want to earn more than $10k a month? Getting those $20 sales on automation isn‚Äôt that hard with a good content or ad strategy. Even with a ten percent conversion rate on upsells, the profits look pretty nice. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $20 500 $10,000 Core Offer $47 50 $2,350 Upsell 1 $147 10 $1,470 Upsell 2 $497 1 $497 Total Revenue $14,317 Scenario Ten: High Roller. Chapter 5: Part 10 High Roller. A few years back, Digital Marketer did a study that found that they could charge THREE Times the price if they divided that price into three payments and it converted almost as well, only a 2% difference. Instead of charging $97, they charged three payments of $97 and only lost two percent of sales. Payment Plans are DEFINITELY something you want to consider adding to your model. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $20 500 $10,000 Core Offer $47 50 $2,350 Upsell 1 - 3 PAY $297 10 $2,970 Upsell 2 $997 1 $997 Total Revenue $16,317 Something else you want to consider is making sure that your tripwire cost balances out your ad budget. Work on your conversion rate and prices so that you break even on any ad costs with trip wire sales. In other words... If it costs you $2 for a new lead and your tripwire is $20, you need to convert every tenth lead into a customer to break even. Or... lower your lead cost. Or... raise your tripwire cost... but that could hurt you if you go above $20 depending on your market. If you‚Äôve served them well with your free offer, you may be able to get more. Bottom Line.

## Quote 2

> I'm wondering, so I talked to you in Samantha that one time and we talked a little bit about tracking time and she was definitely not interested in it and everybody operates differently. That's okay. This isn't that. picking lots of other things. But what I will tell you, is I haven't even marked it this exercise, although he pushed off on it for a long time first. But imagine that our time is, so imagine we're a store, and the store operates, and it has a certain amount of stuff that it can sell and make money with, right? There's this fixed, that's your inventory. Well, your business is the tasks that you do. It's rather than items on a shelf. It's the supply is your time, and the things that have to get done. And you have a certain amount of hours to work with. And that's it. So by tracking time, if we were to track everybody's time for a couple of weeks, this has nothing to do with micromanagement. This has to do with finding out what Legos are in the back. That's all it is. It's understanding where things are. are going, how long it takes, and looking at it and zooming out and going. I wonder what would happen if we changed the order of operations. I wonder what would happen if we changed who's doing what or when, but until we don't even know what questions to ask about how we can do it better, until we break down how everybody is spending their time. And if they're not afraid to share it, if they're not afraid to really track it. So for example, you've got Mike, Mike, we know Mike is late, we know Mike takes longer breaks, but we also know that Mike is bomb at getting just distributions, and that he likes doing it, and it doesn't stress him out. And so, you know, imagine everybody's a stick, and on one end there's a poopy side, and on one side there's gold, and you have the gold. but the only way to get the gold is to pick up the poop, like that's how people are. We've got the good, we've got the bad, you get both. You can't separate them, you can't cherry pick what's good about people and refuse to accept what's bad at them. most of the time, our strengths are actually the same things as our weaknesses apply differently. So for example, I'm very bold. I will say what's on my mind, I will step up and get things done, I will just do it. I have this like bull energy and it makes amazing progress. And my brain is powerful and I'm able to think about so many different things and so I can run several different things and several different projects faster and better than the average person is. But that's the strength part of it. When I talk, my brain goes ding, ding, ding, all over the place and people who are not like ADHD cannot follow it and it annoys them and it frustrates them and stresses them out. And when somebody repeats themselves even once, like I heard you the first time, I understood you the first time, you are annoying my brain when you repeat yourself. So now I'm annoyed and that's frustrating them because they're like, well, I need to process things this way. And so to them, it's a perceived weakness. Also, the strength of my energy, some people find incredibly intimidating when it's directed at them, even though it's not directed at them, right? It's just the conversation that we're having. So they hate it when it's pointed at them, but they love it when it's pointed at anybody else on their behalf. But they want to make me wrong for when it's pointed at them. And I'm right and wonderful when it's pointed at anybody else for them. Now, I'm not being any different. I'm being me the same all the time. they're deciding if it's right or wrong or good or bad and they don't get to. Does that make sense? So, you know, Mike, his nonchalance is what makes him so good at distributions because he doesn't care. He does, he does the job, he does it well, but he doesn't care what people think about it. That is exactly the same reason he can roll in late and take long lunches because either you're going to take it or leave it, but I'm going to do what I'm going to do. They are exactly the same qualities. One has a positive effect that we really enjoy. One could be considered non-professional and annoying, but you don't get to pick and choose how it shows up or you do, but if you get rid of him because you don't like how it shows up in his time behavior. here, then you lose the power of how it shows up in this conversation with clients. You pick up under the sticks, you either take the stick or you don't, but you get both sides.

## Quote 3

> So we could throw in an image like that, too. Let's see if I get the image. So because we have limited time, this is, this helps kind of just give an example. Let me see if I can add an image or maybe I could just drag it in. Let me just complete that particular step in my head. It's not a desktop. There it is. All right. right. Yeah, so what I would like to do, however long it takes, is spend some time, a lot of it I can do myself, and then I could show you, and then on calls we can kind of work through it and go, I'll go like, well, here's what I've come up with. And then discuss it, and as we discussed it, I would imagine because this is what happens is I'll either get inspired to make modifications or you'll have some modifications that you'll suggest. But at the end of the conversation, however long that takes, we will have a template that a person can pick and choose and say, okay, I want this board I don't need this board. This is not applicable, right, but they'll have the master thing. So instead of going and adding boards, they can just remove, remove, remove, being able to visualize the whole thing can help. And so it in and of itself could be its own product and service. The other thing is, though, if we get a high level client, then we go through and say, okay, these are the boards that are applicable. now we just create. eight assignments, like, who's going to do this? When is this going to get done? Who's going to do this? When is it going to done? There will be dependencies that are built into the template. For example, if you're building a sales page, first of all, you have to have a domain. You have to have hosting. You have to have the, you have to have a merchant processing. You have to have, maybe you have to have a gateway if you have a merchant account, know, like all of these things. But then you have to have copy. You have to have images. The images need to be inspired by the copy. So the copy has to come first. So there's a dependency, right? The copywriter has to know what the name of the product is and has to have some information on them. So the copy is dependent upon market research and definition. So all of that stuff can be created in a, not necessarily linear, but somewhat chronological process and for people. I've never done this or never done it well. Most of the people that have done it did not do it well, did not do it quickly. It'll be the first time they've seen it mapped out like that. Even on a high level, because a lot of the high level, and I'm talking about seven and even eight bigger earners, I think it's very different once you get to nine and above. They didn't get there by not systematizing, optimizing, even if they're not good at higher somebody who is good at it. They understand the process because somebody else was helping them in doing it. They did it themselves. But seven and eight figure earners, a lot of the times just got there by grit, determination, charisma, that type of thing. Lots of times. It's not through good business structure, organization, and optimization. Anyway, I would like to do this. So what I was talking about is for us to create an agenda. And the agenda can be we progress on it even if we can't meet because stuff is going happen. Yeah, we can't meet but then we still know what we're working on. So to me and I'm going to go ahead and save this for now and pop over to this one, questions for next meeting, I'm going to say agenda, meeting agendas. I'm going add a card so big rocks call it big rocks so big rocks are not that open card. Really the big rocks so I'm kind of prioritizing them. So the big rock is one, two, four, five, on the through three not two three one two three anyway one three um high level df done for you um clients or done with you either i'll say df y slash the clients um that we work on together in either well in some marketing plus project management capacity in order to fund everything else and keep our saws so we'll put this here then the other thing would be so i see the next level down would be hybrid coaching group. Yeah, I'm not gonna call it group where we get to serve mid to get, I'll say mid level. Because this helps us ascend our audience. The higher level helps us refine our teaching serves as energy for us because we're in the community of people who are doing things and have experience, but don't need a ton for us. Yes, we end. they are doing things that we don't. have a high level of commitments to them. Also funds, whatever we are building.

## Quote 4

> in the two hours a day, there's a lot that you could do. There's a lot of research, there's a lot of copywriting, there's reporting time, there's all kinds of things that would go into. One of the things I always do for my clients, which very few people do for them, is I set up something for them and then make them owners. So I used to use base camp. Now I'm using Trello because base camp is more expensive and it's more convoluted than it used to be. And Trello is still very simple. It's just camben boards and I can invite them and then I can make them owner, where you can't do that with base camp. You can't somebody to an admin owner whatever. But that way, because you want to teach them, and this is a gift that you're giving them. to own their reporting, own their data, own their stuff, no matter who they work for. So a lot of people, and this is again kind of my leadership style and what I give to them is I teach them, delegate, don't abdicate, but most people abdicate. They say, they think, I give you my money, this is your responsibility now, no, because they don't care about your business like you do, they don't, you know, all that, anyway. So, so keeping all of these in mind, one of the things I would do is, let's say, and I would write this down, and I can, I can take some bottom notes too, but I would start with one of the things I'm going to do for you is create a project management suite there. So it's going to be a Trello board where we're going to track all of the things that are going to get done, and I'm going to task by everything so that you will be able to see what I'm doing, when it's due, or whatever is doing, if we end up hiring somebody to do something, and you will be be able to see everything that happens as it happens and you'll have a record of it moving forward. So if you want to duplicate this across another one of your products, you'll have the project mapped out that you could find what's usable and duplicated to the next one. So this is an asset I'm creating for you that you'll be able to use again and again. Because now you're value-stacking, right? not like I'm just not just getting you the money that you want. I'm creating assets and value that are going to have compounding benefits for you. But the other part of that is now you've got something that shows your work and keeps people from breathing down your neck. Well yeah but Maria didn't get me the results, I didn't get the sales, I wanted whatever. Okay well you can see Maria strategically went down through the list and your offer still didn't convert. know that because you can't make everything convert well whatever. There's a lot that goes into that. Anyway, so the next thing I would do, but I would have done this before coming into it since your job is conversion, I would have looked at the ads. And I would have looked at the ad account because just even though you know the conversion rate, you don't know how bad or good the ads are. Like if they're really good ads and he's spending $50 a day and can only get that, that's a red flag, that's an issue, that means you're going to have an uphill battle.

> you can look at that. So then the next thing would be so in order to support the big rock. So the first big rock is this. And so, in order to do that, we need to create Trello board template. And we'll do this. Right out. Already. Slash pedigree. Post page. That's what I was looking for. Products. Already created. And define which ones need to be updated. Okay. All The sub task is create tasks and due dates, assignments, can we repurpose it, can somebody else do this, can we delegate it or not, for updating those products. And then, um, that creates a webinar or VSL or VSL or video, either way, however we do it, um, Our history, um, how we grow businesses and how. The power. of, you know, your marketing specifically, and my project management and ops is a powerhouse catalyst for sustainable growth. Something to that effect. So we've been talking about, that's what people need to see, right? They need to see who we are, what we do, how we can do it, we put it in some content where, because first we have to increase their level of awareness, just that we're even there. We need to have a application form, qualification form in order to talk to us, paid time that is given rebate, basically, on towards working with us. So to me, that's it for this big rock, because we have clients at some point, right? So potentially create maybe YouTube ads for getting eyeballs on this content, slash offer, whatever. I mean, but that's, it wants to this. But to me, that is the overarching kind of view of like, what we've discussed should happen. And that if we do this, and if we do these things well, it should attract the people that we're looking for.

> and make sure we need to do this and then that that's being done like perfectly and then the other side like the basic stuff starts to like get missed so it's like I don't know if it's something about you know being able to see it in order for them to not forget but it will help it will help a lot so one of the things that I think that whoa actually meeting myself um that we might do and again please frame this with your team and let them know that this is a work in progress that there is this is going to be probably really clunky in the beginning and maybe more of a pain than it seems like it's worth but if they will stick with it we will make a system that works well for everybody and it makes at least some improvement for everybody and from everybody's perspective if we're wrong about that you got a person that probably ought to go because really it should be something that everyone can get benefit from. The only reason that wouldn't be is one if they're just that negative or two, they don't contribute to developing the system. Meaning they've made suggestions, they've explained with some kind of articulate eloquence why something doesn't work, so we can figure out a workaround. But at the end of the day, things are falling through the cracks and not getting done the most efficiently possible. The goal is not perfection, the goal is progress, but progress doesn't continue to come without being intentional about it. You can't just show up and be like, hey, you know, I'm going to do what I do. Progress comes from strategically planning how to improve doing what you do, right? So that's what this is about. So to that point, Patrick, one of the. things that theoretically, because I've not used Slack like this, I have used lots of other project management suites. But I don't want to create a new application that you guys have to log into. So I love the Slack idea, Lauren, by the way, good job. And I love you, Brad, chat to me too. I was like, I just know you got to do that. I'm such a nerdy girl. literally be talking to chat to you in the middle like, okay, how do you write this? How do you figure out this? I had an hour session with my 14 year old daughter trying to plan her career because she's like, what's a good place that they have lots of pets, but not a lot of vets, because she wants to be vet. So we talked to chat TBT and it's like Aurora, Colorado, and then we were off to the races for like an hour. Anyway, hang on, Lauren, real quick. So, Patrick, what we should be able to get is notice a pattern like, like you just said, right? If we start doing this, then this dips off. We start doing this and this dips off. What you'll probably find is that just paying attention to things, so just thinking about how different operations have been for you guys just because you thought about it differently. We had conversations, it stuck in your head, it popped into your head throughout the week, you're like, oh, you know what? I'm going to go do this. That's what will happen with your team too. They're like, there's just something changes as soon as you create awareness. So there's the level of awareness of just, oh yeah, like that's a lot of stuff that has to happen in the case, and it has to happen with every case. And there's kind of like a timeline that has to happen, and then when you add in the fact that you're looking at your cases and Lorenz you're like, or either one of you like, hey, it's been three weeks, nobody's checked in to see and make sure, you know, client didn't die. Everything's okay. We've still got a number. that works. All, you know what I mean? Like, once a week, at least are hearing from us, Hey, we're just checking on you, letting you know where we're at. You know, nothing has really changed, but wanted you to know we're here, we're working for you. That kind of thing. You're doing that. Your whole team needs to do that. So the more visuals we have here, right, the more structure that they're looking at, if they can see the tasks and slack, if they can see the outline of these or all the things that have to happen, instead of trying to keep it in their head every day going, wait, what do we need to do? Like, did somebody leave me the correct notes about what I need to do next? Do I already know what I need to do next instead of sitting there for two or three minutes ago? Oh, yeah. The next thing is, out of those two or three minutes over a week, over each person, over a month, over a year, we're talking tens of hours at the very least that we're saving doing this. And that's on your best day. Sometimes people going to show up with a migraine, you got women sometimes are going be cramping. Sometimes and somebody's gonna be hurting, depressed, whatever, all kinds of things, right? The mental lag time multiplies at times like that. So this mitigates some of just the humanness and the weakness that we have. And but also really helps everyone to see how is the whole case flow doing, even if I'm not the one doing it. And again, if somebody's like all of a sudden, I'm gonna be out for two months. Well, what has Mike been handling? What's been Mike been on top of? like, look at all those mics. I got to give that to somebody else. Holy crap, know, like Lauren's you're going through this stuff right now. So it's a process, you get some insight with the insight comes some improvement. And also with the insight comes more burden to an extent because now you have a new awareness that, oh, we're actually to not doing so great on this. But overall, it creates lifts, it creates traction. And as you've seen, Patrick, now with chat GBT, you'll notice one of the things that we improve a lot is just the mental effort. We're reducing the mental load and leveraging the mental effort. Chat GBT, if we can use Slack, so you're not having to manually remind everybody, chat GBT, helping us strategically plan it. It's not real AI. It's just logic. If this, then not. It's got a database of questions to ask, but for the most part, the output is equivalent to the input. So if we ask it really good questions and logic, it's not going to come up with anything we couldn't have done ourselves most of the time, but it will get there much faster so that we can process the next question, the next step, and so on. And so, anyway. But At the end of it comes, your cases get done faster. More reliably, we should be seeing better incentive pay. also within, so timeline, roughly 90 days. It's going to be a pain in the butt for roughly 90 days. The first 90 days are lots of growing pains. It takes about 90 days to work out and create the first iteration of a sick, the first successful iteration of a project management system with a small team. I'd say 45 to 90 days. Okay, so bear that in mind. Think about whatever is important to your team, especially that this is going to help us a lot when somebody's not available or the team changes or you're just having a rough day and we can't keep track of everything. thing. The goal of this is not micromanagement. The goal of this is not to create more work. So ask them to have a little faith and try to be part of the team making the process better. Okay.

> And yeah, I mean, that's the biggest thing, technology in terms of project management in terms of automations for customer in terms knowledge and connection and even customer nurturing with the automation, right? So not just acquiring, but nurturing and extracting everything you can out of each customer and increasing the lifetime value, but making that reciprocal and creating the nurturing that gives everything you can back into the customer. That's a lot of shiny for me. That's fun because there's so many different, you know, like AI, all. these different things. But also the psychology of how to do that. So I get to study marketing psychology and I get to study leadership, which is more shiny to me because I love like Adam Grant and I love Robert Chaldini. And those are shiny for me because there's a new thing and I'm like, ooh, what happens if I apply here? But it's still like I've been doing systems. Everybody knows me as a systems person, which has kind of been detrimental to me because I'm way more than that, but that's where put their heads around.

## Quote 8

> Right. The other thing that, And I think that this is something we could probably start to help you put some meat on and create a framework, which is something I never really did well because I really kind of custom tailored around people. But now that I've been doing it for so long, I realize that there is a plan, there is a strategy like semi modules. For example, to give you is I've got principles and priorities, know, I have to go even look them up. That's how I know what they are and we go through them, but thinking about them chronologically. So principles and priorities, and then it goes into finances, and then it goes to time tracking, and then we go into project management, and then we go into teams. And then we go into hiring teams, and then it's sharp in your saw and kind of mindset and things like that. And then it's iterative, constantly, right? But the reason we kind of start there is because principles informally, priority, priority informs what gets done. And the reason we go to our finances next is because finances let you know what you need to be gunning for, what you can do, what you can't do. Then we get into time because money had to dictate what our resources are before we even think about how we spend our time. But also priorities had to be dictated before we could even think about our times, you know what I mean? So then we get into project management. Okay, now we know what's important to us, we know what we can afford, we know what we need to set as a target so that we can get to the team that we want to work on. And now we know where we're going to spend our time, let's structure it, let's get it into a project management suite. Okay, now that we've got that, who are we hiring, what's our dream team? And it could just be one person that we're starting anyway, but I do kind of have a systematic approach now. Not everybody is at the same place in that conversation has nuance of. looks a little different but really it's not and the reason that it looks different is because of values and priorities and things like that so budgets you know and things like working in front of the screen working behind the scene kind of thing you know things like what's your conversion right right how many eyeballs you're getting on your offer what is your offer how big is your audience list how many offers have you even made to them how long have they been sitting there not getting an offer um you know did you did you just give them one offer and it was way up here did you try down here did you ascend them like there's a whole lot of things that can happen kind of chronologically and so you go through that going oh you missed this spot let's come back here you missed this you know what i mean or you did this but it was we don't have clear data we have data but it wasn't well or you made this change since the last time you did this this. So systematically approaching all the things that you know how to do. Now, if you built that into a written down framework of these are all the things that I'm going to look at because you just do it automatically.

## Quote 9

> No, okay, that's what I'm telling you. Look, I don't have the time to think pretty. know you guys can do better. Don't talk like me or people will hate you and be scared about your jobs. They're jobs. Okay, so don't do that. Yeah, anyway, I'll ask GPT before I have please reward my my this sentence so that people don't feel threatened with their jobs, but Here's the thing though, they're grown-ups and you have to realize that your metrics matter and your ability to hit the goals matter. They're not random goals. There are profit margins involved in the business. The goals are set based on the profit margins. Okay, a lot of money is spent on marketing and a lot of money and excessive amount of money is spent on incentive program. It is not super- for profitable this model that's here. these goals are very important. Now, the goals, if everybody is rowing in the same direction in the boat, we get there faster and better, right? Yeah. So you, I'm giving you the overall conversation that needs to happen. You have to finesse it with your people. Don't be like, Tina said to do this and I'm like, everybody wants to quit and they're scared blah, I'm not, no, I have a recording. I did not say just go, don't do it. But you want to read them. You want to have a conversation and read them and know how interested they are in hitting the goals and making things work well. Now, if that angle doesn't work, the other angle is, you know, how much would you like to see things go smoother without really having to put more effort into it? How would you like to kind of just reduce them, the mental load of the... the job but still get things done and it's a little bit easier. Most of people would say yes. The reason that's important is because in the beginning this is going to seem like more like a pain in the butt. Systems and organization take setup and they take getting used to. Old dogs, new tricks, that kind of thing. People just tend to not want to do it. So you want to frame it with ultimately this is going to make less work, less stress, easier to get to the goal line without sitting there going wait what should I be doing. You'll know exactly what you should be doing when and why and how you're doing. But also when somebody is sick and when somebody is not there, everything's already assigned. You've also got historical data about what's been done and how much has been done. It will help you with reviewing your team in a good way. It's saying like, man, you've been doing awesome. All these tasks, because I've been done on time. And then you'll also be able to look at, because you can go and alitify and see, you know, what's the average days to close, or resolution, and give them that and go look at that. This is improving. Patrick, you're still new, but, you know, you'll be able to look at that and just know what your targets are from the beginning once you start separating and having your own cases, not any mixed with Mark, whatever. Like, your day is kind of dirty in the beginning, but it'll be really good. So, but in order to get people to not be negative and go, you know, talk, and also the other thing that you should tell them, like if you've got problems with the issue, you need to bring it to me, but what's not okay is to go murmuring around and being negative about these things. So. So yes, it's new. The point of it is to make the job easier, easier as for to cover each other when somebody's out, and less like trying to keep track of everything in our head and just kind of see how we're doing. Like unless you're the kind of person that just like, hope somebody's looking at your work, then you're probably in the wrong firm because that's not how many things here. So anyway, I think you guys should have that conversation and then we should find somebody and it could be one of you guys, it shouldn't be that hard. Or we can set our next conversation next Tuesday and we can go into Slack and walk through this and do it together, set it up in one account. then if we can duplicate it to another one, like maybe create, I don't know, new channels. I don't know how it would have to go. We'll figure that out as we do it. But worst case scenario, if you don't have anybody that you can deputize, you'd be interested in doing doing this. And Isaac, if Isaac is around and he would like to do it, that'd be awesome. Especially because he can, he can share that with Mark and go back and forth there. But this is a great idea. This is a perfect follow up with this conversation that we had. And really could lead to really, like I said, reduce mental load. Because you're visually going, this is where everything stands. And automatic reminders and follow-ups. You don't have to sit there and follow up with your team constantly. Slack is doing it for you. And then you get to see, well, are they doing what they're supposed to? Are they checking it? Now, the other thing that will happen is Slack notifications are going to increase. So that can overwhelm some people.

## Quote 10

> Like, oh, I'm never doing that. None of these, to me, are the simplest forms of success. Right. There is always extra and and they talk about the 80-20 rule, but I don't think that they really understand it or they they just overcomplicate it because We really don't have to have that much organization and structure. The bottom line is what are your most profitable activities, effective hourly rate, that kind of math, right? And what are the things that have to be done in the business or it fails to exist or it diminishes that is tedious and takes the visionary away from the most profitable activities. Those are two massive leverage points. Number one, you spending more time doing the most profitable thing, which almost always is also the thing that people love most. That's why it became the most profitable thing because you loved it first and we're good at it, almost always. In fact, I have not seen an exception yet. And the other one is as quickly as possible and creating a path to this if it doesn't exist. all the other things that pull you off of that off of your plate on someone else's. Specifically, someone who can work autonomously and not need to be micromanaged or anything like that. To me, those are the first two levers to go after. And then systematizing inside of that. But mostly, it's just a huge awareness of the greatest value in the business, starting with human resources, starting with the visionary, depending on how small it is. And then a single person of support in the highest level. So like Seth Ellsworth, his biggest person would be a salesperson, or a lead generator. The next biggest person would be an automations person, because what he does is largely automations. For Mark, Mary, um looking in the documents or looking at some of the reports and managing managing the people being available frequently and then having attorneys over their pods just being better leaders has you know those are his leverage points for you a developer because so much of it is technical and then a person to track tasks and move them forward and not necessarily a single person in any of these things but those are leverages and so you know there are things to glean from email from bill to sell from EOS but yeah anyway just contemplating all of that and but but things like that so you understanding going for a full circle how staying on top of technology has been a massive lever for me is for you, too, because the technology itself is the lever. So GA for being able to provide so much data, but the first thing is you have to wrap your head around GA4 and how it works in order to unlock the gift that it has in its data. And knowing most people will never do that, most people are just kind of going in the dark because they don't have good data, they don't know where to get it, or they won't put the effort in if they do know where to get it. anyway, you just leveled our leopard game, that was a long way to say that's what you just did.

> Why don't think so? He's too new for that, I think. I think, I think, I need to ask Mark about what left-hand knows about the right hand in this company, because... Yeah, I think one of these days I need to get Mark on here with all of us, so I can do same page and be like, what's up? That would be helpful. Yeah, so just helping because Arizona volume is increasing. For September so far, Arizona is leading the pack in terms of volume, so that's a shift. It wasn't like that before, and... So that has to come into account, especially because not everybody can practice in Arizona. Let look at this close to 25 team, and that's probably an outlier case that's not bad, which you have to drill into and look at. Average days to close cases, that number is shrinking. That's good. And Patrick, you're still not really getting the, what I would call a normal load to really look at this. So I'm gonna stop sharing on that right now. What I would like to talk about if I can find the right tab is just some tasks. Okay, so we talked about Oh, hold on a second. I'm gonna go to all this plants and provide feedback and culture and based on it. So the problem with me, I know to me to write my own notes, but then I'm busy talking so it's really hard to get them good. Let's do this and start with this really because I meant to ask you this, but then I got distracted. What? Tell me what you've just been working on, what you've noticed. You're working on in terms of leadership and management over the last week.

> Time mastery, making the most out of the hours you have, things like that. Business and project management, it's the same thing. It's teaching people the simplest, but as you can see, they build upon each other. Knowing what you want to earn and how much you want to earn starts and works best when you have your priorities and your values. Because so many people are like, I'm going to earn a million dollars by that. Why? Well, so and so did. And I'm like them. Yeah. Like, well, that's, you know, that's not gonna make you happy. Anyway, dream team, people want to hire when they have no business hiring, when they have no skill about delegating, when they don't know how to train, when they don't even know how to hire. And they want to go spend $3,000 a month when they're making $10,000 a month to hire somebody.

## Quote 13

> So I really want to, like, make this stand out so I can find this, that's easy because what I really would like to have for each of these projects, because my notes are weekly, right, and I go review and sometimes I copy and paste notes from the week before into next week's coming out or like save this for next week and just copy it so that I know I want to talk about But what would be really good is if while I'm talking, I've got the stats of whatever it is that we're working on because I have to keep a lot of that in my head or be able to scan through the notes quickly find it. Teamwork as a system for kind of tracking progress by itself isn't that great. probably just need to have like my own kind of stats spreadsheet. So I have this, so I'm not like asking that constantly and it's always staying in my head. It stays in your head because you're doing it all the time. But I ask better questions if it's in my head all the time also. And when I'm thinking about it throughout the week, I'm always thinking about these things throughout the week, then it's more effective too. So anyway, not to self, actually, I'm going to send that email to myself. And apparently the problem with email is not on the Y. That's weird. Oh, just because you have so many things going on, you're the only person that has so many things going on, but I have so many things going on and you have so many things going on. So that's a lot of my brain, which is low to my brain, and the nodes do help a lot, but I think that they could be better if I had those particular things, which are especially because the goal of being creating the market share increase, the value that we want to get to, like those are all the bullets that I want to have is like where we're at, when's the last time we measured and what are the things that are doing and just kind of, and I don't think you look at it quite the same way I'm talking about doing it. I think that it'd probably be helpful to you too, just to go like, oh yeah, it's actually this. And then what I know about your brain is when you see something more often than you would have put it in your face because you do have all the things going on. Your brain just goes light up and thinks of something else and then you go do something else. Incredible. And then come back like, what happens when I do this? So anyway, I will set that up. What is this? Oh, that was the new product for another 71 that you were talking about. You've launched that, right?

## Quote 14

> Especially as daughters, you're going to get those. But whenever possible, I would just say that problem will wait until tomorrow when I'm in that kind of zone. So, in the morning, I don't want to engage with anybody. don't do client work. I don't answer emails. I don't respond to anything that could be, um, conflicting or contentious and they're not the same conflicting could just be I don't even know I have to make a decision and I have to evaluate things so it's complex I'll say complex nothing complex in the morning because now I'm in problem solving mode. But in the morning I want to be in creative mode. So, because I want to use my best mathematical skills for creation and building and leveraging rather than problem solving because solving a problem honestly I could do that stuff in my sleep. But being creative is not a space that I'm in all the time. My brain is good enough I can solve most problems most of the time. Creating is different. building my business, creating new solutions, creating new organizations, hiring things like that so so my morning time is for. reading, meditating, just being slow and quiet sometimes just hair and makeup is a therapy thing for me. I'm just quiet. I'm not listening to anything. I'm just pondering and thinking while I'm doing it. And this has been really helpful for Mark too. He's doing meditative stuff now, but he used to talk Dolce. But in the morning, what he used to do is reach for his mom and immediately stress cortisol problem solving. His creativity, his problem solving in a creative way has massively changed since his morning routine has changed. Speaking of which, have to go meet with him in one minute. So we'll go through more of this schedule. But the goal is every week that you've got something that you feel like you can work on. something that you're pondering, something you're enacting, so we've got the gist of it. will send you a follow-up email within the next few hours. I'll say by end of day today, just because Mondays are kind of crazy and I gotta make sure where's my phone, set my alarm, set an alarm for 3 p.m. Call it get-go-g notes. And now you're official. Yeah, so good job. You'll be getting an invoice too for being 8 if you do it again. We'll give you, I don't want to give you a free pass. I'm gonna give you a free pass, but don't do this again. Get your homework done because, you know, massage or like, just imagine you won't pay $180 for just when you like it. You're definitely gonna hate that whole $90 for not getting your homework done. So I'm gonna give you one pass, one.
