## Quote 1

> Mark is so good for that. Um, Well, um, so I've been working with Mark for the last three years as actually a client of mine and I started working with him kind of partially on business systems teams whatnot. Um, I would call myself a business consultant. He calls me a coach names, whatever. My goal is basically just to help people optimize their business, but for them. It's not really all about the numbers. It's kind of more about the overall just quality of life, um, quality of operations, quality of team. I take a holistic approach to everything. Um, and basically the end result is that people end up being happier. So that's not how I started. I started out just trying to get the most out of the least because I'm that girl. I'm like, I don't want to work all day, but I want all the things. So yeah, I would, I've been a single mom for a very long time. And I also like playing and coaching soccer and doing all kinds of things. So I was like, how do I optimize this stuff? Got really good at it, helped people with it. But the end result was that as I was doing business, I ended up finding some things just made me really kind of angry, honestly, working with bad clients, working with bad people on teams, just being overwhelmed. then I'd go be kind of sharp with my girls and then I'd watch my four very strong will daughters ricochet that attitude across the house back and forth and so I learned that there were some things I needed to cut out and so some systems and processes were born out of Yeah, so that's where we started I've been working with Mark for three years, sweet lot has grown a lot since then in terms of how many retainers we get per month versus so when we started it was about 33 per month and now we're averaging about 90. But the team hasn't actually grown that much so we didn't have the Arizona office then and obviously your new since then and I think that we have lost one attorney since then so there really hasn't been a lot of team growth. growth in order to support that, which is speaking to the optimization of what is done, if that makes sense.

## Quote 2

> we just had the meeting yesterday to determine what is the big rock we're up selling this to eventually and we'd agree to be more of the CM pocket CMOCO offer and then also I think it was also like a maybe a group watching thing maybe or is it more just the but anyway so when I know what the end result is then when I record videos and stuff I can indoctrinate them into that other offer right so here's what I think you should I think everybody should keep this in mind all the time if you're going to be in any kind of coaching I think you should have top middle bottom tiers and the and there's multiple reasons for that but I'm going to touch on them super fast sure top tier higher money higher effective hourly rate but also higher level energy coming back from your clients when you work with high level people they teach you as much as you teach them you learn from them it's also higher energy and just higher value so it kind it it financially energy basically and intellectually fuels everything else that you do, the high level tier, okay? But you can only do a little bit of it. It also takes a lot of you energetically and intellectually, okay? The mid-level tier is to me, so we're talking about the 10% that not going to do a lot, the 10%, they're going to succeed no matter what you do, and then there's that 80%. And this is the impact-making group. This is where you make a difference in the world, the greatest difference in the world. These are the most influential, influential, influence-able group of people that you're going to be working with that need you the most that are most primed because they have the money, because they have the understanding, because they have the ability and the willingness to act upon what you're doing, and we're gauging that by the things that we've set out. to attract them as well as the things that we've set up to filter out those who don't match this particular group set really well. So but they also give a significant enough amount of money that they that we're earning from them and they help fuel you know our lives and what we're doing in our business but they're also the bigger pool where we get feedback because it's hybrid coaching right so we're getting some feedback in real time on what we're doing and so it's the biggest pool of it's the biggest feedback loop that we're going to get about how our stuff is working in the marketplace how what we're teaching is helping people or not helping what we need to do to improve what we're doing. Then the lower tier is kind of our give back but it's also the most scalable it's the most hands-off so it doesn't cost a lot anybody that wants it can probably afford it. by skipping McDonald's once or twice a week, if they can't, you know, if they need a leg up, this is where they're going to get it from, but it doesn't take a lot out of this, because once we build it, it's done. It doesn't require a lot from us, but it does don't give a lot because they're getting essentially almost all the knowledge, at least all the knowledge that they're going to be able to use anyway because of what we've already predefined that they're able to do. So, anyone coaching and teaching should have all of these tiers for all of the reasons that I just said, they need the center group for the feedback loop and to make the impact, because anybody who's coaching wants to make an impact. That is part of what made them go into it in the first place. The high level group is needed because of what I said, because you need to have that high energy, you need to have that high earning power. Um, you also want to have high level connections in case you ever need it in the world, but also be a high level connection. So that's important. And then the lower level thing, again, is just the super scalable, um, low, low impact. And if it continues to do well, that's also a market signal saying that this market still exists. Um, it continues to deal with lot of impact. So a lot of touching on it and everything that you do feeds each other. So everything that you do to serve your high level clients should, should come down. So you create, um, the things that you need to really support your high level clients. And that becomes something productized for each of the lower tiers. And so there's not multiple efforts, but there's three levels of entry points. Three levels of earning power three levels of energy, you know what I mean, um, so it can be That you have those three levels for YouTube, but I wouldn't do that because The to be a high level YouTube creator and coach almost really feels like you've got a high level in video production and Yeah, in their minds probably yeah, and that seems like a lot of work Because there's a lot of skill involved. We're talking about huge processing power Yeah, time suck. So having a top middle and lower class for YouTube itself does not seem like a great idea as YouTube as a channel inside of marketing inside of a marketing Operation business hybrid makes much more sense to me as you are such a generalist and I am as well even even in my systems operations that if we're going to have an and you can't the bandwidth required to do more than one high-middle low level type of offering as a coaching consultant would take too much more than I would be willing to give more than you would probably be willing to get so to me that is the offer it's business sustainable um business growth um profits however you want to call it through a marketing systems and operations right and obviously it needs a sexier name but but that's it and so hopefully that gives you some clarity does yeah yeah so yeah um one of the things I'm going to do is put in um to uh

## Quote 3

> Um, so that's good. Um, but, but this would be the thing. There's so much to it and that that's the other part like lately we spent about half an hour on. And, um, at the very least on lead to things like that, which is an important part of it, but, but for the things that I do, managing overall company structure, business growth, things like that, working with you as the CEO, like a dance time, we spend probably half of it, just talking about, well, it depends on what it is, what week it is, whatever. Yeah, yeah, um, but, but I'm able to go there, depending on whatever happens, and this, this three way version we have is the hybrid, and there's a lot of stuff I want to get to that there's, there's not enough time to get to. And especially where we're at right now, having systems for, we've got some good clear data. Anyway, I just feel like there's not enough time to really dig into some of the things that will work. will make the biggest difference like this and it really stretches out the runway for what kind of growth can happen. But I think that more is possible because you're primed for it now. You know the need for the numbers. We have a system for the numbers. There's more knowledge about your team. We've improved the processes. But I just don't think there's enough time really to dig into it and put a really solid framework on what's happening and there's constantly, you know, in the office, very having babies is what it is. You can't change that, right? But I really am concerned about the goal of wanting to grow and optimize the business and not having a physical presence in it and no one who is really looking at optimizing the business being in there doing it either. The reality is that It just doesn't seem like those goals are very compatible and I want to, we don't really talk about that, so I think that that's something that needs to be addressed. Now, if you're like, let's just have the best business that we can have while I'm not in the office a lot and just make this work as best as it can, then that's a goal. And it's something that that we're doing, but it doesn't feel like that's really what the goal is.

## Quote 4

> Yeah, so, I mean, okay, we're almost out of time. I want to make sure that we use whatever and cover whatever you want. But what I, you have other businesses, let me go to my notes, because I would, wanted numbers on everything, even Esther's businesses, if you want. would love to look, because here was the main goal, right? How do we double your revenue without really increasing your time and your workload? So that answer is always leverage and optimization. And the more things that you have that we could leverage and optimize, the easier it is to double without increasing your workload too much. So you have multiple things that could be leveraged. I would love to see the stats in a spreadsheet that I can look at with you on everything. So what we had talked about last week is anything that you could consider a KPI, right? So any revenue coming in, any expenses, where the revenue comes from, any kind of delineation that you can make between the numbers in terms of hours work to fulfill it, staff to fulfill it, at marketing sources and revenues, different price points, whatever it is between all the things we want to document the historical data, then analyze it together and formulate a plan for a small increase across the board with each of those things. then I'm pretty sure that if and then probably like I said take a few weeks because first you've got to get all the data, then we've got to analyze it, then we have to come up with a plan and then we have to see how the plan works. So it's not an immediate thing. So the sooner you sit down and capture this stuff, so that's the penalty for you is you don't have to worry about sending me money, you're not going to be making what you could be making probably pretty easily if I can't see those numbers and we don't go through this exercise. So I'll just let you sit with your losing money by wasting money, leaving it on the table. If I'm not doing the work, that's really all I have. don't have anything, any other questions other than when you get that data. So the other thing that I will tell you is once I see it all, I'm going to ask you to show me where you got it from and kind of prove that those are the real numbers and that's the accountability part. So you told me that you will answer things sometimes incorrectly according to what you think wants to be heard and I'm going to hold you to proving it. So I'm just letting you know I had a time. But the other thing is then I get to see how organized the data is, how necessarily reliable it is, what the potential is for managing it, what for growth and just kind of look over your systems because if they're efficient then they're If they're okay again not doing well, then we'll talk about that the Francis like July will you say me what you want because like I Collected the app like the P&L's and the profit and losses um, is that something that we that I should we because I can ask my bookkeepers for any kind of numbers and they can give me reports on them If if I know what to ask them So those are kind of things that you want me to start getting or like, uh, what kind of KPIs Let's start with P&L's for any business that you have and I would like them for the year and like total but then quarter by quarter. We won't go month to month and that will give us some starting things So just bring the raw data To our meeting we will dig through it on the meeting. It will be slow and it will be tedious These next few weeks are probably just kind of not be as fun as an exciting And I just want you to focus on the delayed gratification for a bit while we gather this because the planning that comes from this is really exciting.

## Quote 5

> Yeah. So Jason's a beast. He's super tall and she's really short and they always did video even though Tina never did. I'm really good about it now. And she used to be a hairdresser. And they. They used to do media buying, but they did all the campaigns. They created all the marketing and really just the whole growth business plan. And then they did the ads and they wrote the copy, they tracked everything. And they did amazing for these yoga studios that then COVID came and shut everything down and went to here. But Jason, they're both brilliant. Chandel loves the systems and the marketing. Well, he loves marketing too, but so he loves marketing and the tech. And he is really brilliant at creating the tech and snapshots and creating the automation and she loves the marketing, but does the customer support, the hiring, the deadlines and all that other stuff. and I've watched their kids grow up and yeah, anyway, but you know, to me, they're kind of like under the radar, but although I've I mean, their group is just growing.

## Quote 6

> I mean, try to put it this way. Starting this, I never had an expectation of being in this position, so I am incredibly grateful and thankful for where I am. The other part of me constantly wants to push the envelope for better force. And so that is always my struggle because there's part of the tail wagging the dog, trying to grow, but we've got to catch up to where our growth's going to be. But at the same time, the question always comes up, okay, so what is the plan? What is next? Where are you trying to get to? I rarely ever have an answer. Sure to remind, I certainly can belong to my doing this. Okay, this business gives me the best chance to make the most amount of money. I don't know what else we'll do. That would give you the same opportunity. I see the cases as a piggy bank for lack of a better term. They're there. They're worth a lot. And so, you know, that's there. I have a lot more flexibility than when it first had when I started this room. Obviously working for someone else. So, you know, I don't want to show up. I don't have to. There's nothing that I have to do. But along with that comes more responsibility, right? So, when the fan, you're the one who's responsible for it at the very, very, very end of the day. So you put in safeguard, you've been processes, but as we grow. As systems break as didn't happen that we wouldn't necessarily expect to more just quite frankly the nature of the business Didn't Mexico lawsuit barfing it's not really anyone's fault. It was just an on the other side. It just is what it is I have to get more used to it because we've had a fairly straightforward run and Or that is some Really easy going and I'm not gonna step over dollar or such trying to pick up pennies Yeah So if You just had All the money that you wanted and didn't have to work Would you work? Yes on what I don't I still think I'll be back here trying And Do the same thing that I'm doing now you know, seeing people be able to buy their houses or get married or, you know, a house to build in their lives because of this is, you know, rewarding. But sitting on a beach, sitting in a drink, it's fun for like maybe a month, but to be bored pretty quickly. But, you know, if you're like, you have all the money in the world, would I go be like a VC or something? Maybe that would be more interesting, you know, helping solve business problems. Trying to figure out how to help people with their issues and problems in a business setting to help them grow and get them where they want to get to.

## Quote 7

> Okay, with that, Jeez. Come on. So, yeah, so minimal invincibility, it is an extra expense, it's, I mean, a go-high level is $300 a month anyway at an agency level. you know, we could put that at, like, 2, 2025, where, okay, now we've got a community, now we've got people, and we could just start, instead of migrating people over, we can offer them, say, hey, we're migrating, but basically, live in both areas until everybody dies off here, or we moved over and can incentivize them to move over, because you get lost when you try to move people to new building, right? already got subscriptions going, and that's not good. Yeah. So, anyway, we could do that, but in the meantime, this allows us to teach them quickly into fulfill what's been sold and to nurture them, and then high level would be part of the larger master Sound which is first of all kind of automating the teaching experience with the follow-up Hey, did you check out this you know module one? I noticed you didn't check it out. Here's what you should what you can do for blah blah blah which takes a lot of time to write that kind of Engagement nurturing sequence, but we'll get more people to consume the content More people to get results and really help us to make a bigger impact which also then creates more brand awareness We'll sort of mouth all that but in addition to it then we can start working on expanding the You know the marketing and the business growth and upgrading right so higher value higher price and But also now where you can you will have money that we will have earned from here like like let's set a goal hold on so if we're talking about the beginning of q2 in 2025 that we've made 80,000 through this by then. So 40,000 for you, 40,000 for me, but let's say we set aside 10,000 for each. So maybe like we set aside 20% for business growth includes marketing systems teams forever. And then we just put that in a kitty. And it's, it's, you know, but high visibility, you see it, I see it, we both can see it. you know, you know, we know exactly where the money is at, at all times. And we have weekly updates on finances and total transparency. And not because either of us have any concern, but because that's just a practice. don't allow apathy, we don't allow any kind of temptation or anything to create that. I'm not worried about it, but the thing this, as soon as you stop worrying about stuff like that, you know, the adversary is good at what he does.

## Quote 8

> Yes, or just overwhelm. The whole point is to improve efficiencies, not to create more more tasks, more issues, more noise. So it will probably be wrong the first time to three or four. So that's where we need your leadership and having conversations with the team in working through it and be like just use it, tell me what's wrong, what doesn't work, so that we can fix it. This isn't, we are going to do something and you're going to do it. like it or not. Like we're exploring growth and innovation to improve and the specific goal is to improve efficiency but mentally as well. So we've got this entire lag time of task switching, right? And we have this list of basically 20 tasks that have to be accomplished across hundreds of cases. Your volume isn't quite there yet, Patrick, but it will be. And the goal is to increase the volume for everyone. So that scale, you know, there's a ceiling somewhere as to how much we can accomplish and how much we can do well, as well as what's the quality of life day to day for us doing the business. know, our human resources are everything. There is no business without human beings. And we all have emotions and we have limitations and things like that. So just a reminder, the goal of the system is to optimize for the human resources, right? It isn't prioritizing the task so much as the person who is completing the task and kind of building the Iron Man suit around them so it has to be compatible. Now, it is not going to be equally compatible with all people on the team. That's just the way it is because we're all different but we do need to be fairly consistent. Where we can make alterations per person without breaking a system, we will look for those opportunities and I want you to always be thinking about that and working with people. the alteration is just your approach. in getting them to use it, understanding what their intrinsic drivers and motivators are and how you can align what already drives them with the system and how the system can support what is driving them. Does that make sense? So you can keep exploring if you want to right now but maybe don't go whole hog on it right now till we have the conversation with the litify experts. Right, want to invest a ton of time into this if it's going to be a different system anyway. Yes, because so there's a couple of things that are going on. So we've been talking about reports this is kind of an ongoing process mostly due to the fact that we have a lack of frequency and conversations. So which reminds me, I got to follow up. So A lot of it goes through email. have infrequent touches throughout the week trying to work with a guy who works on the little by reports, and then we need to have a same page meeting, but also Mark was a lot like there's just a lot going on. So the pace of this is kind of slow, and I want to come back to that in a minute to talk about what you guys need to do in order to create and maintain and potentially increase momentum. In the meantime, but so we've got the person who creates reports who is not litify, he actually works his brothers and attorney, and they have a firm and so he's nerdy and was figuring it out for himself because litify is not great at reporting. They build this infrastructure, but it doesn't work well. It's very clunky. I don't expect them to be a whole lot better when it comes to the automations, but because Mark pays a ton of money. That's where he wants to start is having conversation with them. And if I get to be there, then I'm going to probe a whole lot and see what we can do. And then the other thing I'll do is take that back to our reporting guy who's also been digging into Letify and see what we can do. So this is probably going to take a couple of months to even get to one like version one that is any kind of really useful. So I want you to kind of put that in perspective. And then additionally, we're going to have a conversation with Slack and because Slack knows Slack really well, Letify knows Letify really well. The two of them know each other a little bit probably, but being able to talk to the experts on each one and then come back and come back to you guys and create that version. The way that the conversations are spread out, we're probably looking at a couple of months as a time frame, essentially 90 days. Roughly, the first iteration of every type of project happens between 60 and 90 days, almost consistently across the board. So keep that in mind. In the meantime, I always like a quick and dirty version of the system and it starts with just awareness. So we have the one spreadsheet that we created, which is all the types of tasks that have to be done per case, and who works on them, right? And then just touching the cases and looking at it and making sure we are on track. So that mostly comes down to file review and scanning quickly. So this is what I want to talk to you guys about. How has that been going for you? love to hear from kind of forensically, like low level forensically. that in terms of what's been happening, what's the anatomy of the case, like our list is basically the anatomy of the case, right? so we know that there is kind of an order of operations, something can happen simultaneously, and that we decided on a particular amount of frequency that for sure nobody should be going even a week without at least getting a text message like, hey, just checking in with you. How is all of that going for you?

## Quote 9

> Yep. So maybe we consider changing the branding and putting out the language. of hey you guys have seen me be doing you know this thing that thing because one thing that I am is I'm always a student I'm always a teacher I'm always a marketer and in that vein I've done these things in the past but really I'm an expert marketer and it helps you know to state who you are how are they going to know if you don't tell them yeah and and that goes back to the pedigree and the authority post of this is what I've done what you see is what I get excited about because this is social media and I'm being social talking about these things yeah what you don't know is I've done this and this and this and this and clearly this is what I'm focused on and I'm working with you know another systems at like another business growth expert who focuses primarily on systems and teams but is also amazing at market. marketing and that kind of thing so but but I think that you should always think about what are people thinking when they're looking at you and what are your the people that you you're like your ideal clients the ones that would pay the most the ones that you learn the most from the ones that you want to maybe do profit sharing with what are they thinking when they see what you're putting out there just something to think about and if it matters so to me it's a long-term leverage play to always know like what are other the high leverage people thinking when they see it yeah I also am I don't care who thinks what I'm just gonna be me and you know teach and do whatever but I do but there's wisdom that I've learned in considering those things because I have the best opportunity to serve my people when when I'm leveraged, when I'm making good money, when I'm working with very smart, high level people. So I need to make sure that they're aware that I'm out there and that they know what I'm capable of. So those opportunities come so that I keep sharpening my saw and up leveling, you know what I mean? they need to know that I'm out there and what I'm so anyway just something to think about is like who there's an audience that you serve and there's the uh not the stalkers but what are they the the lurkers. The lurkers are the high dollar payers that never say anything but DM you and say hey look I've seen you. I've been like I've got money you know I mean? They they operate very differently but I but I I want you to always think about what are the lurkers thinking when they want to.

## Quote 10

> No she has an employee mindset and you have a visionary entrepreneurial mindset that's what that issue is that's going to be an issue that is going to cause problems as long as you consult with her regarding growth. God. So you either need to keep her in an employee role and don't counsel with her as a partner of any type and decision making and growth and you need to compartmentalize her or you're going to need to just not have her which I don't think is what you want to do but something is going to have to change at that dynamic, if you're going to keep growing and evolving, and especially now that she has kids, that that would have existed already. But now she's nesting and that is counterproductive to what you're trying to do. So I had, I'll give you an example. And this is this is not the only thing. It's just the thing that pops in my head, because there's lots of different partnerships and things that pop up. I remember one time, because I worked at a call center, everywhere I worked, even when I was a teenager, I got promoted almost instantly, like within weeks. And so I worked at a call center and I got promoted probably 13 times in six years and ended up doubling my wages and that amount of time. I worked for first it was Apple and Intel. And then I went from Intel call handling to Intel network. working. And I learned how to build networks from the ground up I worked with. NASA at the Pentagon called me for tech support. It was a lot of skills that I had. but the payment like, you know, I was 19, 20, and no college because I dropped out, got rid of I lost full ride scholarships, I had two of them. And but but it was an opportunity without school to get paid to learn some massive skills, which have actually been the foundation for my business skills. And but I would constantly get promoted. So I'd be moving and having new jobs and new training, I got put into management training and certifications and all that kind of stuff. My ex husband at the time, he's like, you're first satisfied. You're never happy. like, wait a minute, where do you get that? I'm, he's like, you're constantly changing everything. Like, when are you just gonna stay in one place? that was really similar kind of thing. Like, how how do you it wanting to grow with not being happy and not being satisfied, they are not the same conversation whatsoever. Like being happy with something and being happy with the same thing next year and the year after and the year after is a completely different conversation, right? but in terms of having people who have had right-handers, know, well, I'm thinking now that that's what you call a Mary but I've had other people where they had somebody who wanted to show up in tick boxes. And this is a conversation by the way I just had with Lorenz and Patrick but it was specifically about Lorenz's team and I told him you cannot have a box ticker in your company that has to be counterproductive to sweet loss culture because those are people who will do just enough to get the job done. And the way that you work for reviews, the way that you work for the reputation of sweet law because of the impact it has on maids, box-taking will never be a powerful magnet for that. So for example, cases that hadn't been touched in two months, which shouldn't have happened, by the way. So I've got to go back and tell everyone's heater off the ball that it could have been gone that long because that's supposed to be getting cotton reviews. But, well, it did get cotton reviews. I don't remember who said they would do it, said they would do it and didn't do it. So that was 30 days ago. And but now I'm realizing he told me they're doing everything every two weeks. So he should have noticed it within two weeks unless he just, you know, what. or let them go, so that's part of it. But the issue was is that there are certain types of cases that people on the team don't touch, or they, here's the box ticking. I called, okay, did anything happen? There's no response. There's no update. Nobody did anything back. Nobody drives this case except for you, you and your team. So if you don't have a driver, it's going wherever it goes. And just because somebody doesn't reply to you doesn't mean, okay, well, I did my job because I took the box. I made a phone call. And so we had, I probably went on a rant for like 15 minutes on it between him and Patrick to make sure that they understood what the concept is and how you identify it, and that what that actually is, is apathy and complacency and cannot be, like I said, be tolerated. So anyway, there's something that you need to be watching for and Mary as well is to see if maybe there is becoming to be some some apathy. How does it show up or is it you know playing small and what can she do where that attitude can't be contagious and infect anything else in the business but you also need to know what can't she do that might infect other places in the business who could she talk to like is she going to complain because this was an issue you guys had in the beginning was talking behind each other's backs is she going to complain about marks always changing growing looking at offices every whatever like it so deciding on where you want to go is really really important and then where you going you need to make sure you've got the right people going with you yeah but first thing is deciding Where you want to go because what we were talking about last week is, or maybe the beginning of this week was, I don't know if I want to go, you know, drive, go, go, go, go, or just, you know, slow and steady or whatever, which, um, you know, I prefer slow and steady with sprints. Slow and steady because it's sustainable growth, but sprints because that's where you get the momentum and there should be some, you know, level up kind of effort happening, but it's not sustainable to do all the time. As a human being and as a company, it just, and you also can't make adjustments. imagine you're building a skyscraper and you're adding a new floor every time you do a sprint. Well, there's going to be some settling and adjusting. weight's going to change on the foundation. You have to allow. for, and this is, I don't build, I'm not an architect, so, but in my mind, right? You're allowing for the settling to take place before, and make sure it's all firm before you build the next thing. And when it comes to changing, let's see, a new system completely changing the phone system is one major change. an intake process, this call script is another thing. Like, you can't observe all the changes and see how well they're doing if you're making all the changes at the same time. So, in terms of like growing really fast, or growing as fast as you can, to grow as fast as you can, and sustainably, you got to pick, you know, one major thing, insert it, you know, implement it, and then see how it's doing, make adjustment, and then that's the new status quo, and then you build upon that.

> And Dan Meredith, it was, was wanting to get into copy. He was copywriting, but he was kind of new at it and he had his gym. But he did everything on notebooks and he just, I think he didn't define his values in the beginning. And so that was one of the conversations. And then it was stick to them, you know, and his values were shifting. And that's something that people have to take into account because values do shift generally until you kind of lock into your real core values and then they really never shift, not the main ones. But there's a point in most people's lives where they're shifting, shifting, shifting until they lock. I think kids are locked in now, but then they were definitely in flux and it was just the conversation about what you want, be clear about what you want, be honest about what you want, be aware of the way that you're sabotaging your opportunities to get what you want and stay focused, stop trying to please everybody, stop trying to, you know, don't say that you want to be a business owner and then also want to go play and do all these things, like which one matters most? If you want to play most, be honest about that and go do that. But don't act like you're a business owner that you care about the business. And so those are the conversations to have with a lot of people and like I've got one client and he's an eight figure client and he wants a lot of growth and but what he wants most is freedom. And so, the kind of growth that he wants requires more management than he wants to put in, and I said, that's okay, but you just have to be aware that there's this disconnect and pick the thing that you want most and the thing he wants most is to not have to show up in the office when he doesn't want to show up in So, then you have to be okay with, you know, 80, 20, right, this 20% of the time that you're not there, that a lot of stuff is just not going to be optimized and working the way that it should, but it's so profitable, and it gives you everything else that you want, except for the massive success that you want, you know, you have to be with the trade-off that you're not getting to the level of accomplishment that you want to, because the other accomplishment is you have a ton of freedom. Freedom and happiness that other people will never have.

## Quote 12

> So, so if you forecast, if you, I mean, you can forecast at this point, right, to some to a pretty solid degree. So, what happens when you forecast it out, right? It's you should be able to say, Hey, like I just did this for us, right? I forecasted. that we will hit our subscriber ceiling, I forget what day I did this on, but it was 155 days from the day that I did it. And then at our meeting this morning, we are 30 shy of hitting that ceiling. And when that happens, that's it. We're not going to get any more revenue unless we change something, right? So in our scenario, I have to change new customer, the new customer metric, which is I'm working on that, right? That's the only path to growth. Same thing with you, right? The path to growth is more retainers. But in my forecast, our overhead doesn't change, right? So it's like, we just won't make more money. We lose customers, we make less. But if we say here, it's like, we're just going to get stuck. And what I figured out was when we zoomed out, like when I zoomed out, which will be different for you, right? When I zoomed out, was like, oh, really don't work. really just kind of stuck for lack of a bit of word or no, it's actually true. Like we're just stuck at around three million, you know, 2.8 to 3.2 million a year. Like we just float in and out of that zone, throwing in the global pandemic. So it's like, okay, if nothing changes, if actually not nothing, if that new customer metric does not change, nothing else will change, we can just stay like this. for you, it's like, okay, how do you forecast this stuff? Because this is the scenario, like, it just made me think of, oh, it's my buddies, even knows this. I don't think I told you the story. So in, yeah, in January, my buddies like, oh yeah, we're gonna triple the business and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 60 days later, he was laying on top of stuff because he, and I swear, Tina, up. And it was, Because his, he forecasted improperly and like was using some math magic, some really happy math. I was like, Hey, man, I don't know about this. And within 60 days, he was asked out completely upside down, laid off after staff, and is now still playing catch up. So that was in March. And he's kind of, he's treading water now, but they're about to lay off like their number one salesperson. The benefit of it was, I mean, I don't know if there really was a benefit, I guess there was, is like, now he's really digging into like the inner numbers, right? He's not just looking at the surface level things. He's going deeper on these numbers. And he's also figuring out that certain processes don't work that great. But here, it's like, what's if you forecast that, what actually shows you what's going to happen. That's the concern I have it's like okay if I look when when when is that what is that horizon like oh yeah we're gonna be back we're gonna be in the black whatever you want to call it in 140 days because xyz is gonna happen based off of all this data I mean you have years and years with the data granted you do have growth that's happening over here but and never assume growth I would never unless rock solid yeah how'd we look at that looking at it if I use a hundred retainers and I would throw out the person outlier cases to me those aren't real those are just creepy yeah I can't rely on those no I'm looking at a hundred incidences or sorry a hundred retainers which were usually beyond but I think a hundreds of pretty solid number 15% between drop and sub-out rate which the real numbers 12 I'm using 15 as a

> We need, no matter what offer we're doing, low cost, highly targeted leads. Exactly. It also gives us a complimentary offer. If we did the whole, you know, business growth strategy, which we may not want to do, you may just want to focus on this. And then we use, um, you know, business and systems to make their YouTube strategy and their business better. Right. So, of just the whole marketing in general. Yeah, when that we do do YouTube traffic strategies. And if you want to upgrade to higher level coaching, we'll also offer you systems and team support, because the more that you grow, the more support you're going to need. So there's all kinds of ways that that it can work out.

## Quote 14

> No. All right. So good job, you guys. Okay. So John still wants to know what he can do to make his job a long term career that allows him to provide for his growing family. And you talked about how to become indispensable by consistently growing as a case manager, team lead. Mentor for Mary and Paralegal. I love that. That is one of my favorite things. have two kind of I don't know, M.O.'s part of my M.O. two aspects to my M.O. which would be one having unimpeachable character. That means I am the same everywhere. My feistiness, I will punch an old man in church if he's encroaching upon a young lady's face. I don't care. You can be high priest. I don't care. If you crowd a knee back off and if you don't take the signal, I have punched people. Okay. I'm a defender at all times. I'm enthusiastic all times. I love God and Jesus at all times. I sometimes swear really badly. Jesus loves me at all times. You know, but that means because I'm the same everywhere that I go that if somebody says something and it is out of alignment with my character, everybody's gonna do know that that's not true. Even if they don't like me and they don't want to defend me, they'll just be like, that's not possible because she's literally always the same person. So unimpeachable character meaning just you're just the same and you're person of quality and integrity. I sometimes I'm not the most polite I can be rude, but I'm never hurtful, I'm never vengeful, I'm never dishonest, I'm never um anything that somebody would go like those qualities, right? So that's one thing. The other thing what was the oh this I am always seeking to increase my value to those I serve. So I think everybody is technically replaceable, but that word indispensable is one that I'm always looking for. I've been a consultant for 22 years. My business is 100% what I'm mouth. I have not done any marketing and it's been a six figure business for working about 10 to 15 hours a week, by the way, since, I don't even know, it's about nine years. So, I have the people pay me a lot and in my industry, I am an anomaly. This doesn't happen. My business stands out even at like the highest level coaches. There are a few exceptions that that can do what I do, but almost nobody does. And here's why is because when I feel like, and this has happened several times, I feel like we're having the same conversations and we're just maintaining, but we're not growing. Well, my job is growth. My job is improvement. They can maintain if they get to the point where they're like, yeah, Tina, I'm doing all the things you taught me. I've got nothing else to teach them, then I don't lose that client. I don't want to, mostly because all my clients are really awesome, but also because then I've got to go replace that and I don't want to do that either. So I'm always sharpening my saw. I'm always looking for a way to be better at what I do. I'm looking at the new technologies, I'm improving my study of psychology, I'm improving my study of leadership, I'm improving my study of operations, and because I'm always growing, and also because I'm working with people who are always growing, that conversation continues to evolve and I know that they're not having that conversation anywhere else. Plus I'm paying attention to them, I'm taking notes, I'm thinking about what they're working on throughout the week. I don't just talk to them and then I don't think about them until I talk to them again the next week. And so because of that, I know because most of us don't have somebody that is really paying close attention to how well we're doing, and looking to make sure that we're doing better every week. So I know that I'm serving a very unique function for people that probably no one else is serving except for maybe their mama's. No. And so what you said is great is what are the functions that he can serve that maybe other people in the team aren't serving or what can he do best, but because we can't all do, like there are some things I just, I don't pay attention to details really well. So I do if I'm listening, but if you're going to give me a 20 page document, I'm never going to read it and I'll read half of it because I will read a paragraph and then there's my place and think a new thought and my brain just can't focus. So we've all got weaknesses, things that we don't do really well. The point is not to try to get better at the things that we don't do well. The point is to be excellent at the things that we do well because that's already in our real house and what that does is create so much lift that where our weaknesses creates drag the lift over compensates for that does that make sense uh so I love that you did that how did he respond to it um I mean he he was positive and he agreed with me which is his natural response you know that did he and this is what I want you to listen for and I also want you to tell him if he doesn't give this to you that this is what you're looking for and the conversation is not going to end until he does this which is give me an example of how you would do that what do you think about when I say that what does that look like to you open ended so he can't parent your words back to him and if he tries to parent your words back to him you say okay but that's what I say said. In your own words, what does that mean? What does that look like? And then you can just be quiet and let him sit in the awkwardness. However long it takes until he decides to not well also did you know that I think it's like two twelve is statistically across the board the least productive minute of the hour of every day and guess what our meaning is it's right around there so I won't take it personal just little bit just little bit and I'm sick did you eat oh that's not good did you eat chicken or beef I did the chicken first today so now you get to look forward to the beam all right all right all right this is last Please come and say some words. Um, so with John, there's, there's a little work to do, but I love what you're doing. I love the goals, nine cases ready for demand, 200 K and fees. So what I would like to see, I don't know if you have this next week is, and this may take some time in my brain literally can't even picture the start of it because generally when I want something like this, I will create a foundation. But I would love to see team steps, um, with all the cases that you have, who's working on what on a spreadsheet and then what that equates to monetarily so that we can track that improvement so that we can track your performance, your leadership performance. Obviously, we're going to have the big number at the end, which is what are the gross to. but if we break it down by how each individual set of goals impacted that bottom line number, then you'll be able to have an even bigger impact to that bottom line number, because now you know what the little levers are, right? specific goals by what specific people was able to create that lift?

## Quote 15

> Well, in correlation with E-Mits, which actually is updated, called E-Mits Revisited. It's very different. Built to sell by itself. Not so much, but it gets into the nitty gritty of what E-Mits lays down in broader framework. But I would like you to read it, the latest version. And basically, this is going to sound oversimplified, and you may want to push back on it, but I'd like you that suspends your doubts for bit. But the premise is, there's a few things. mean, they talk about org charts, I think, in there and the maturity of companies and how they get there is by strategy, planning, and specificity. And one of the topics, the thing that made me think about it, is what are your menu items, basically? Like, you can't go to McDonald's in order of filet mignon because even if somebody let you do it and they went to the store and they got a filet mignon on the chart to prepare it, first of all, it's inefficient. Second of all, they're not going to be good at it. Third, you're not going to want to come back. Fourth, the repetition of whatever you create and provide increases your efficacy at creating and providing that thing. So there's a potential that, I brought it up before and you said that that's not practical, but we don't have the data that says that. and there have been a few times where something you said was one particular way and then we dug into the numbers and lo and behold, it contradicted what you originally thought, that there may actually be a system and a strategy to the most leverageable cases rather than a catch-all of we need to take all the business because that's the only way we can catch the big winners and the big winners are what save us at the end of the day, whereas optimization may actually be the thing that not only saves you but puts you where you want to be at the end of the day, which is the most likely thing by the way. So I would like you to read that book and just see if you have any thoughts and really, really, really try to suspend any negative thoughts about why it can't work because you could be right and that's okay and those thoughts will happily come back in as soon as you let the door back in. What we need is what are the new thoughts that we haven't had, what is the new understanding that is equating us, keeping us from getting to that thing that you're trying to get to, that for sure, that's how growth happens. We learn the new thing, we do the new thing, and then we finally get to that. But if you want to be something different, you have to do something different, that kind of premise. So anyway, and it may give you some thought as to what you do want to build, which is still the conversation I would like to have. But now that we've got 20 minutes left, so Dan, don't throw a rinse in it.
