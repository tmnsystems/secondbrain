> 2024-09-17T20:00:00Z 00:00:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hey, Patrick. 00:00:05 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) How are you doing? Good. How are you? 00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Good. I'm trying to get on my windows up in real quick. saw you sent your assignment. I haven't got it yet. Microsoft. I'm gonna move this over to Google Docs for myself. I won't even let me copy it. Oh, dude. I don't want to go through all those steps. Um, yeah. I'll just look at it here, I guess. Um, how long did it take you to do this? 00:01:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I had a new guy that came, I basically did this with him for, believe, the other week. Yeah, because I was just explaining what we do, so I kind of already did it with him, so I just had to put it on in writing. 00:01:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, do you feel that there was anything useful about it when you did the exercise? Did you think anything? where's it just recording? 00:01:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) This is what it is. I mean, it's always good to know. Like, just get some cases to make sure that you know exactly what steps need to be done on each case. It's easy to like skip one and then. 00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like the health insurance stuff for the distributions are out like it'll come up because accounting needs those to process the distributions but I mean we did we do so many cases like you pretty much already know what needs to be done yeah and I only have two other people on my team so it's not like the tasks are broken up to like four different people yeah my gosh I hate I have a Microsoft account but I just never use it I have a PDF I might ask you to send it some other way because I actually have like three accounts I've got my school account because I'm a student I've got one for my mission and I've got my personal fun and they don't make logging in easy like you can't just anyway yeah Uh, yeah, if you would mind just copying pasting it, even into an email is fine. Oh, that should do it actually, let's see. I'm gonna try to get it signed in. Oh my gosh, always it makes me like reset my password. Chirping, oh gosh. That an allergy is my eyeball sting, sting, allergies suck. don't know you have allergies, but they suck. My little sister doesn't have a little. that's you so lucky. Everything makes my body just go bleh. right you emailing that to me yeah thank you let me open up see what i'm going to do i will make a new spreadsheet is what i think i'll we need a lot of like copy and paste in light bro calm down thank you what the heck Oh, good. Okay. I was like, it wasn't letting me crowd it. Okay, so I want to do this until I want to do it. I'm going to share my screen. So I want, that's everyone. And then I'm going to Actually, so introduction call. I'm just going to kind of do this stuff together. Um, because it'll make it easier to kind of sort and track this time. Did I do that right? I'll see does this and does them the best. Okay. So nobody is assigned to that. Oh, so he never mind. It's just in a different row. Um, sending defendant insurance. 00:06:28 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Cynthia does that. Okay. 00:06:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Sometimes the formatting like breaks in between things. Like this. Okay. Cynthia, he does it best. The job doing us by the way and thank you for that. That'd be helpful. Well, she and Cynthia are able to do the same. Okay. I'll see limits, other policy limits level is that or same level. Never mind. Okay. I'm trying to like fry in my brain. I got like four hours of sleep and not for good reason. I mean, kind of it's tucked in my sister and we're ridiculous cackling into like one o'clock in the morning, like 12-year-old, but making red jokes like 10-year-old. 00:07:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It's plenty of to wake up in the morning. 00:07:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, 540. So that's who worked out so well for me. I'm a little punch drunk, Patrick. But it's okay. She had to get up at four o'clock. 00:07:54 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) She works at a methadone clinic. 00:07:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She's a nurse and she has a 45-minute drive. I have to, when she comes home, she's going to be dead driving on these windy roads. I kind of, I know kind of like, I do feel bad about that, depending on what the call is regarded. Right. See. Soon. And now this is tedious. I'm just doing this and that seems always full of the time, but it's not because formatting it will just do some things I want to get into kind of creating a structure for time. Okay. And this will be better for kind of visualizing it and making a correlation to case-in-case volume. My daughters' birds are going nuts, it's got parakeets, okay, let's see, so introduction call. now bear with me because systems optimization, all of this is a case-by-case kind of process, right? So there are fundamental things that I look for and ways at approaching it, but it gets customized is for multiple reasons, team, time, and also the person who's running the system or the people who are running the system. So, for example, I know you don't want to read books. There are, you're not the only one. I use this example because it's the first thing that comes to my mind of, like, Mark, I wanted to have him do a gratitude practice just to help him be in a more positive mindset because it works really well. He's like, Tina, he tried for a few weeks. didn't really push back. He just really didn't do it. He's like, it's not really my thing. I said, that's you got to tell me that because, you know, just because I suggested doesn't mean I think I know all the things and it has to be one way. It has to be the way that you will do it, the way that you can buy into it. If you don't buy into it, you're not going to do it. You're not going here. Continuing client. Elsie does this and does it best. Okay, we'll go back here. I can tie. Does it best? Okay, and client doctor. gonna guess that's also Elsie. Patrick and Elsie depending on what the calls regarding. Oh wait, I put that in there. I'm gonna just didn't get it actually there. Now this is why putting things in a good format to begin with, which I did not specify as far as she might have actually, but it's okay. Just because later. So Um, preparing demand letters, why I know you just have to do that. That's Mark wants you to do that. Right. 00:12:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Uh, all the attorneys right there demands. 00:12:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. We just had the conversation screw looking at AI demand writing services, negotiating and finalizing new settlements, doctor reductions and distributions. Now, I know that at least the distributions can be done by someone else. What about not necessarily on your team that you have somebody on your team that can do this, but these things could be done theoretically by someone else, right? Doesn't have a turning. Okay. At knowing who's on your team and definitely don't think anybody else would be. That's what is that? So one, two, four, what did I do? Yes, property damage. Copy and pasting would not be that difficult. Patrick, right, I'm just not. OK, all right, um, let me go into little bit a real question. Do not update the password. That's how I get locked out a bit of I could use. There's some stupid things. See. Is that this one? If I mess this up, I'm taking that out to you and I think it might be just one refresh. I the last 60 days or not. Actually, I think I want to know I want reset the parts. How would you be by attorney? All of the cases like attorney are matters by team. And then team Patrick. So you have 114. Oh. Then, let's set up 22 negotiations. What's it? 00:15:10 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It's one we like to disperse the money, but we keep a little bit, as we're still waiting on something. Like a health insurance link to pay, but we can distribute the client funds and take our portion without having to like wait for it. 00:15:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm to do one more thing. So, Mark just took some of your cases right and put them somewhere else. 00:15:53 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, we saw some things too. 00:15:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hank, right, okay. How many? I have a number of that skewed, so let me text Marco because I need him to give you guys a report and I keep forgetting to ask Mark. Hey, when are you going to get me a report that the attorneys can look at with all the stats I asked about? Like weeks ago. I need a saucy face. Whoops. Come on, man. I'm dictating. Okay, so I need that because this should have a correlation to the closed date. But it'll be interesting to, let's see how we made that correlation. Again, I know that it seems like a very scattered frame, but this is the time that we spend creating the process and kind of putting structure on where the time goes is worth it. And it is kind of, I don't know, not just like it's disjointed, like there's trying to wrap around everything. So I'll see, I'll see. Cynthia, Cynthia ordering final medical records, initial documents, sending different insurance inquiries, um, and or policy limits. I also need people's time reports. okay. So Cynthia works in the office or at home or, okay. They're both in the office. And she's there every day. 00:18:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Cynthia, I'll see why it's a week is home. 00:18:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I'm just going to put nuts for myself. I'm just getting like overall operational structure so that I wrap my head around it. So do you think that you have a ballpark average estimation of how long these particular tasks take average, right? Obviously, there will be outliers, some that go very quick, some go very long. If I put a column here, do you think that you could give that? 00:19:42 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Is that just like property damage, like let's say just for one client, it could be like over the period of like two, three weeks to get it done? 00:19:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so here's what we'll do because time has to be We'll go to complete, like so, or phase, because I kind of like these different phases, and then um, estimated time, um, like, minutes, hours spent, like this task type, right? So, like, how, ordering the policy limits, I mean, like anything where you've got to call insurance, sometimes those calls, like, take a while, right? chasing clients down, and so I know that that's not going to have a real number two, but it'll give me some kind of ballpark, and it'll help, it'll just help in the mental process of kind of creating this, and then trying to figure out basically what is the best type of flow throughout world. the day in terms of like blocking types of tasks. And then also looking at it and going, how often do we need to go through this cycle for all the cases that you have so that we're not waiting two or three weeks before we check on the next thing? Does that make sense? Because I don't think right now that you have anything where you do that, like where you look at a checklist, basically, and everybody just mentally goes through a checklist. The problem with that is we are statistically human beings are terrible self reporters. So if you mentally are saying you went through the thing, right, you don't check on it, you don't look at something, we're going to forget or assume the other thing is, it's like the bystander effect that that we assume that somebody else has done the thing. As as Especially if there's a thing where there's, there's two people who do it. So I'll see in Cynthia. I'm like, oh, well, I'll see mine is done then or whatever. So if we have a list and we just kind of go through it and and you've got a list of your cases, checking off whatever things are done. And then whatever stage that we're in now. Do you have something like that in Lidified that has all of these statuses. Yeah, I didn't think so. Okay. And you don't have anything that that you could just go through and say it's in this section. It's in this status. It's in this status. Right. And can some of these be happening simultaneously? Yeah. Okay. So that's another thing that I want to know. So, um, um, can happen. currently it so we'll do that and I'm going to let's see yeah okay so let's see the concurrent first introduction calls obviously it's first thing one of the things can be happening whoa at the same time let's go down that row confirming coverages and liability I feel like that's kind of its own thing that has to happen first and then true it has to happen so none of these like these are all standalone right and then yeah assessing property damage you can probably be working on that while you're setting up for treatment yep okay so this is not for let's see let's say that can happen I'm going do number three for sending defendant insurance inquiry request or D&D. That can also happen, right? Same time-ish. You don't have to wait for setting up treatment and property damage to do sending defendant insurance inquiry or do you? 00:24:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) So typically you wouldn't be doing the treatment if you're sending those insurance and because basically we're trying to see if there's any insurance. 00:24:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so this goes before treatment? 00:24:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:24:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so I'm going to cut these, bring them down here, drag everything up, change this. Okay, let's go through the order then first in case there's anything else that can't be done before the thing above it. Can you hear these first? Yeah, I got to make sure the doors are closed next time. 00:25:33 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Okay. It looks like no, it's in order. 00:25:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, now it's an order. Okay, so one, two, the defendant. Insurance inquire request or DMV insurance chart request. So that will disregard the numbers. Actually, I'm going to go like this. One. Hey, that's not what was supposed to work, dude. Appreciate that. Okay. So any defendant insurance, um, is there anything else that happens with this or is that like preliminary that has to be done before we get to the next steps. 00:26:29 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Um, I guess you can do the intro call and stuff or it would already be done. 00:26:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, so do we need to change this order again? 00:26:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) No, I mean, typically the intro call would be done at that point. The intro call is like the first thing. So. 00:26:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So do we send the this before confirming or are they. 00:27:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It kind of does in techno can't be so like you do the intro call and you know, you they don't have the defense insurance information Actually number four order initial documents as police reports you would put that before setting defendant insurance thing Okay Could Since it's both Cynthia, okay, what else So ordering policy limits medical referrals You can do those simultaneously Okay 00:28:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) five, six. I'm just going to do this together, five, six. Okay. Um, what else? 00:28:24 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) seven, eight, nine and six can all be done together. 00:28:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) six, seven, eight, two, one, two, five, ten. Wait, now that's right. Oh, I'm thrown off because the rest of that. Oh, that's why I'm sorry. Never mind. This is definitely its own thing, own thing, own thing, own own thing, right? property damage weight. 00:29:12 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Property damage you can do with five, six, three. 00:29:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Then can three be done with five and six also. 00:29:55 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:29:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, because what I mean when I. say done with it is like basically it's not contingent, like you can't, you don't have to wait for anything. Okay, just want to make sure we're on the same page. Okay. So, do you feel like most of the work is done linearly, like people thinking that it's this step, then this step, rather than here's all the things that we could be doing for this case right now, what do you think is more likely that is happening? 00:30:38 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Probably like step by step. 00:30:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So, just this right here would probably could probably really help the flow of the cases. Knowing how many cases you have now, here's what I don't know is how long it takes and how much waiting there is and how good it is, but. What I would guess is that there's a lot of time people are just not really working super hard and at stuff and sitting there just thinking about the cases maybe and just glancing at the records and not really pushing it forward. What do you think? Do you think that because obviously I'm not, I don't want anybody. I'm making a wild assessment. 00:31:30 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I'm sure there's like times in the day where it's just like things slow down. Obviously, happens with me too. But I do think like some of these things like policy limits, like that takes like five minutes. You know, so it's like, let's say you're, or you just got off a long call and you don't want like take a call right now or something. You don't want to make a call. could like do the policy limit real quick. It takes five minutes. You just didn't put the info. 00:32:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So here's where I'm getting out with this. And this is my hard- slide that people don't really like, but you'll have no problem with your team. don't know. And and also you're kind of laid back. So if you're not looking at it this way, but my guess would be, especially based off of the conversations I've had with Mark about how things go, is that there are probably several gaps throughout the day, every day of the week, where not much is getting done and could be getting done. Because if you have 116 cases, and most of them are in a status of needing to get something, there are probably 116 calls that could be made somewhere in the team throughout the day. they're hourly, right? You're not, right? Or are you hourly? No, but they are, right? Um, I would bet that all the billable time is not used very effectively or, um, I would just bet that there was a lot of just about 10% level effort. Being put, and this isn't talking about your team statistically. I'm talking about people in general. And I think part of the nature of it is not necessarily laziness or unwillingness to work. I think it is the volume of things to do and the mental effort. And I think it's a lot. I would not do this job. This would be tedious. I would hate it. But, you know, that's me, I didn't go into this. but what I think could happen is if we work through this for a little while, go through it with Lorenz and get an idea, I would love to see you do is kind of create some structure and say, look, here's the list of cases that we have, even if you put it in a spreadsheet and if you're using Microsoft Office, you probably have a sweet lot account, right, with Microsoft. So, it's secure. Everything stays on your own drive, stays, you know, where only sweet lot people could get to it. You could check it with Lidify. You could have some other kind of identifier. don't know if Lidify doesn't have, like, case IDs. does matter IDs. Okay. that would get really confusing. I feel like I'll ask Mark if we could do this. And based off of other work that we've done together, I feel like he would be okay with that. And I'll show him this and see what he thinks. But honestly, I think that this could be really useful across all of Sweet Law. Because just the mental taxing effort of trying to track all the different, like you only have 160, but 116 is a lot. And some of the other teams have 300, you're going to have more. And whatever state that they're in, somebody needs to be checking to see, is it waiting on us? Is it waiting on them? If it's waiting on them, one was the last contact point. If it's more than 24 hours or two business days or whatever, you deem appropriate that we do follow up. So just going through a checklist of here's the things that have to get done. Here's the list of cases. Here was the last touch. So then there were be another column that's okay so like we would have this as a checklist while people just kind of get used to it like oh yeah I could be doing this here's all the things that have to be done and there's a spreadsheet with all the matters on it and then so I really want to see what you guys look at letify what do you do and letify what do you guys record and letify what do you use it for everything like the whole case is on there yeah so all the notes um so like you could go in here like click the matter yeah so this is what I see when I open the case so there's highlight activity can I click on activity I mean I can but so it'll show the last time somebody We touched it, but not necessary. I tried to call and nothing happened, right? 00:37:07 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Um, you could pull like left a voicemail still pending, whatever. 00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. timeline. No. How would you, um, like, no, what's the, what's going on? Yeah. What's the last thing that happened? 00:37:32 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Who, who touched it last? So, on the left side, this big, like, paragraph, how you do it there first. Okay. 00:37:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, yeah. So these are all the notes. 00:37:49 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) These are, they use this side for like, made, like bigger points. Like she's got an injection. So I want to know like that. And then on the right side, the, um, the activity. But if you scroll down, these are more like calls, email the sent out, things like that. 00:38:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) OK, so let's you look at both. OK, let's just let's just run through these real quick and look at something. So this was last touch yesterday. We're going to go like boom, boom through a lot, really quickly. Last touch three months ago. OK, tell me what we are going look at to go. Why was this only the last note three months ago? 00:38:37 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Can you go to the conversations? I know he's still treating, so we could sound like a follow-up text just to keep it on the I loop on what's going on with the case, but he's still in treatment. 00:39:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So, um, do you know when treatment is supposed to be over? 00:39:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Um, can you scroll up to the damages? 00:39:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And tell me like, scroll over here and then the far left. Oh, here. Click on it. 00:39:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:39:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) This doesn't total it for you, huh? But it should, because you are trying to hit policy limits, right? 00:39:47 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It does on the other page. But this. Yeah. Okay. Right. 00:39:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There are total damages. And. And where does it say what the policy limits are here? 00:40:04 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, if you go to insurance on it right there. So it's 150. 00:40:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I'm 50,000. 00:40:16 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:40:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) OK, so that's not likely. would think to hit a policy limit. So then, um, um, I'm not sure how much more I'm to do under this. Yeah, so it again, I know this much, right? So I'm just asking questions. How would you know? I mean, OK, you know that he is in treatment, but if there's no contact for three months, how do you know that they're still going? 00:41:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) you know that they haven't so is there a time period that a person can stop going for treatment that affects the case yeah more so in the beginning like if they don't go to treatment like a month and it's like the big red flag but not later it kind of depends but like if they're waiting for a surgery or something it's obviously going to take some time to schedule it and stuff like that but so as long as the initial doctor's assessment is there that has said these are all the things that they need they kind of have a window a significant window to accomplish it like basically they should be going consistently up until like the pain management visit after that it's like take some time to schedule injections or surgeries or things like that so there's some like I guess there, but like initial appointment, there shouldn't be any gaps really. 00:42:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So is there a reason why it wouldn't make sense to have at least a monthly follow up with somebody or every couple of months at a particular stage help me figure out like, if you were to look at this and just make sure you're on top of it and not assuming that things are going a particular way, what could you do that's not really bugging the client but is being proactive and making sure that things are going along a schedule? 00:42:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Like a quick text? Yeah. Every 30 days or something? 00:42:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Do you think that that's reasonable to at least have your team attend every 30 days? Okay. So we're just going to put this down here, attend. Well, so let's say we don't hear back for every 30 days. So let's say, okay, it's in 30 days, we send a text message. If we don't hear back, then do we check a week later and just keep doing it every week until we do hear back, just to make sure that we're still connecting? 00:43:18 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:43:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, let's see the text. Um, in the case with no contact. Um, well, I'll say example, in treatment. Really, that's probably the only thing, because everything else you'd be talking to a doctor or insurance, or you need to be talking to them about distributions, right? So this would probably be the only time that there's just an okay period to not be talking for a while and not managing the time. 00:44:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Is that correct during treatment? Yeah, I mean, you want to make sure they're going and stuff, but like, there's a certain point where It's less required because like, let's say, they can appointment for like October 28 for an injection, right? Right. It's kind of like It's a month away. 00:44:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There's no point. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. What I'm saying is, is there any other status here that the case could be in where It's acceptable to not hear or not have any communication efforts for even more than a few days. 00:44:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Negotiations like I got a 30 days for the insurance to respond. So There's not really not going to be much update until I hear back type of thing. 00:44:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So that makes sense. Um, but if the insurance has responded, then you're in a new state. 00:45:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Anyway, right or you're still dealing with it. No, it's still negotiations, but I have to update the client on what the offer was things like that. 00:45:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I better. Yeah. Okay. Um, all right. So we were going back in here. Let's just go ahead and. don't want that. Look at a few more cases real quick. Last one September 13, just a few days ago. So, um, mailing insurance, companion matter, oh, um, like, incidences in the same, like, multiple people. Okay, like Yeah. Okay. Yesterday, Saturday, four months ago. 00:46:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) And this one, I texted her recently. 00:46:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I'm stations. 00:46:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Right. Go back. 00:46:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. And you would think that that would be more useful on the home page, just immediately there, but okay, so that's been touched. Good job. This is what we want to see though is that, that says July 24th, don't go to conversations. 18th year to go. Okay, well actually, let me ask you a question. 00:47:28 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) So he's just still in treatment. 00:47:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. I'm going to keep getting them until three months out, because it's all up, okay, three months out. I didn't pay attention to which one I was on, I'm just going to look down here. July 24th. Two months ago. So. Um, what should we look at to see, like, uh, still have back pain and decided to get that after all? Uh, that was three months ago, which I'm gonna call, yeah, I mean, that seems like that should be followed up with what do you think? 00:48:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, was there a note on the website at all? 00:48:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, details right here, July 24th was the last thing. 00:48:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, so this one has to be touched. 00:48:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So here's what I would recommend for you just to, again, so we're just trying to figure out what helps you get things done the quickest without being tedious. Now, the amount of volume that you have, maybe you spread it out across a couple of days, but this wouldn't take very long, especially if you did this every week and just literally went in, clicked on all of them real quick, because what would happen is if you started doing that and you started following up with your team, they should be doing this. They should be checking on their stuff and you go look at it and go, yeah, they're on it. And then you just start to do it as just kind of randomly going through the cases as a audit and just be like, hey, is there anything that has gone too long without being touched? And if so, who did it? Why are we unclear about what the expectations are? just think that we shouldn't, but is there a disagreement internally about whether we should or we shouldn't? is there not enough clarity about what requires a response? Is it that some people just feel like they're bothering clients? And, and, and does that need to be trained because like, who's bothered by getting the job done for them that we're supposed to do, getting it wrapped up posted up that type of thing. 00:50:11 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:50:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) be something that you'd be willing to do is just just go like once a week, just once a week. And you can split it across two days if it just is annoying, but honestly, that should go really quick. I think, I think you could be done with all your cases in an hour. Just click, get out. Because most of them, you're going to see, yep, they touched it. Yep, they touched it. Yep, they touched it. There should only be a few where you're like, that's a long period, or you know that you looked at that last week. And you know that they're not at a time period that, because you already looked at it, right, that we should be messaging out. It's going to be a few more weeks. So after the first couple of times, it shouldn't take you very long. Yeah. But the insight into the gaps should be really quick and really clear. Would you do that? 00:51:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, I mean, my file reviews are basically that. 00:51:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:51:06 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) So, once you've clicked our older cases, I should focus on those. But typically, on the new ones, I'll just check like the intro call was done. We've found insurance to take set liability. Basically, get the case, like the green light to start treating it. Middle ones are more, you know, where are they at? Are they going? going? Do they fall off? Are they missing? And then the really old ones is typically settled or we're just like waiting on health insurance, lean type of things. yeah, mean, I pretty much do what you just asked. But yeah, this case needs to be touched for sure. 00:51:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, what is your schedule for doing that and making sure you've covered that? 00:52:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) all the cases, like what's the frequency? I try to do it at least every other day. 00:52:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) All the cases? 00:52:10 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Not all of them, but like we'll go through a portion of my case list. The other week we've got like a bunch of new files. like, you know, I went ahead and went through all those, make sure like what first of all see what the case is. Is it like a big case, small case? What potential issues we might have with it? Where to send a client for treatment? 00:52:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So would you just be willing then, let's say this is a starter, top to bottom, I'm looking at the way that we just looked at it. then also, and because we're running out of time, I don't know there's enough for you to tell me all of this, but like I'd like to understand all the things that you look at when you do file review. Now, we did talk about, would you be willing to do file review with your team yesterday? You did. And how many files did you go through? 00:53:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) We just felt like we did like 40 minutes. I think we went through like 10 cases. 00:53:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so that's a long process. So my version of this audit is definitely not as thorough as what I think that you were doing. But there were two cases that probably should have been touched that we found in the first few. And like you said, they were older. So what I would like is just once just go through everything top to bottom. And then next week when we're all meeting, of give me some insight as to what you discovered and realize, okay, we should be doing it this way. And maybe it's by the age of the case. Maybe it's by a status or something like that, but. How can we just make sure that we're not going too long without touching the case and making contact with the client? And yeah, it's just about making sure because there are so many moving pieces, so many cases, so many different things to do, so many different reasons, it's not a fluid process, right? Because there's so much waiting on insurance, on doctors, on the patient, the client. So it could be really easy to have for things to fall through the gaps. So having a very specific process that makes sure that the only way to not have things fall through the cracks is top to bottom. could do that broken up as long as you're sorting the cases by date, right, by the day that they open, not because until they're closed. And so let's say you starting with the most recent cases up to like the most recent 50 cases, and then the next one, the next day, the next review, whatever, within that week, two weeks max, you're getting to the next 50. But then, so what I also think is two types of fire review. is just the quick glance, did it get touched, which you could go through all those 116 cases, probably in an hour. And you wouldn't have to go through all of them every week because they're, you know, they'd be really quick. So there's that version of it, and then there's the thorough, are there opportunities for us to like, do we need to do something different? But what I think will happen preemptively, is that as you go through in your skin, you'll go, you know what, we don't need to review that as a team, I saw enough of it, it's good. So then you can mark the cases that you probably should review as a team, have some questions about or somebody else you saw, there was a question that somebody on your team had, and then save those for the team power reviews because there's potentially something to discuss, whereas if everything looks good, you can just be like, you know what, nothing to discuss there, so you don't need to waste the team's time with basically managerial kind of oversight effort, which would be better with you for the most part anyway. So how do you think, how do you feel about that? 00:56:42 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, I think that's the best way to do it because naturally we all go through our cases just to see what's, you know, available to be settled or, you know, these cases are my responsibility at the end of the days, so I need to know, you know, where they're at. and make sure that they get maximized. no, I think you'd write, it's the best way just to go through each one. 00:57:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so let's give that a try. I would love by the time that we meet next Tuesday that you had a chance to just go through everything and look at that and just kind of note anything. One thing I would love to note is how many cases had not been touched in more than 30 days. Do you remember that? Yeah. Okay. And just anything else that might have stood out and let's do the longest. Like, so whatever you notice, like, so there's one that hasn't been touched for three months. If you see anything longer than that, like, I want to know what's the longest that they had reached out just to check and make sure. and then here's our next step, just kind of restating the expectations of how the case will proceed. Does that make sense? Just people are people, know, and especially if they're going through hard things, there's a huge difference for really it's just a little amount of effort. It could just be the text message, right? And you could even have fairly canned text messages that are but let me fix this before putting in the number and or I guess if you're using the automations, it's already there so just be careful. But just it's that feeling of we are aware of you and we're at and we're checking in on you. It's a human nature nurture. 00:59:50 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) no, I get it. I mean, we don't really think about it because, you know, we see the cases every day but it's a business perspective for you, but nearby. 01:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like something traumatic and bad happened to me and all of this sucks and somebody called to check on me and it made my day, you know? 01:00:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 01:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It could do a lot for us and it can also increase referrals possibly if we just really made somebody feel good. It's a little thing. It could have a big impact over time and a compounding effect too as we gained that reputation for just really kind of holding, it's not hand holding, it's 30 days, but compared to just waiting through things, you know, make them not feel like it's a number and a transaction, that type of thing. Okay. Well, we were able to have that whole conversation because you did all of this, so great job. 01:00:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I'm here to see Lorenz have stuff that I didn't know on there. 01:00:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, so we're all meeting next week and we will take a look at it and I think that that is going to be useful too. I'm really glad that you guys want to do that. the the working together thing because I think it's going to be insightful and even if it's just like a five percent difference um but if you give him five percent of your good stuff and he gives you five percent of his good stuff you know none you're both you're both just getting better and and then we're all getting better insight into the whole thing it's good you know that's not good you got to fix that i know that's what navies are for i can't take it out though because i have conversations every day or no no i can't because i just lift super heavy until i can't and then i can't walk for a few days but my strength increases i lose weight i still have more energy my like i did some studying and it's crazy like it's like kind of a new hack. I don't have to exhaust myself. So yes, I I could do better. My last lake press was 390 though, and it was smooth like butter. So I was pretty happy with that, okay? 01:02:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Okay. I'll be able to work out every day. You won't stay up late because you'll hate yourself afterwards. 01:02:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I know, but I'll be so tired all the time. I ain't trying to be like that. And I just no. Naps are cool. Did you know I'm gonna leave you with this? It's like 80 reduction in cardiovascular events for people, especially men who take naps three or more times a week of at least 20 minutes. Massive benefit. 01:02:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I don't know I'm a weekend for sure. 01:02:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, you gotta get, you gotta get one in the middle of the week, just a little 20 minute. Maybe not. You're still young, but you're not up there like grandma here. All right, it was great talking to you. 01:03:02 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) What time is it? 01:03:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) two. Yeah, oh, we're over. I will nag mark for the report again. He did this emoji. 01:03:11 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Good luck. Have a great day. I'll talk to you next week. Good to see you. You too. Bye-bye. Bye. patrick@sweetlaw.comPatrick
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You Thank you. Hi, how are you? 00:04:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) How are you? 00:04:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Sleepy. I'm not fully awake yet. didn't eat yet. daughter took my, well, older daughter took my younger daughters to seminary. So got to sleep in a little bit, but I was up till two working. So. No, it's just the way my body works better like that. Yeah, but also I have a missionary training at nine o'clock. So, are we going to have to check? Sure. think I do. I do. So, anyway, what were we talking about yesterday? 00:05:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We were talking about mama bear marketing, um, talking about the, um, the Google Doc we have on there in the community and how to build the offers and all that stuff. then your boxers, just listened to and yeah, so I did have a fun night last night. Thank you. And, um, and then this morning, I actually was at my mom's for bit and then, but you know, I feel a little off-kilter and then after this call after I picked my dog up because I didn't do my Bible journaling or anything this morning because I just got off and went straight to artwork and then helping my mom. Um, but uh, yeah, so in the chat chat stuff, yeah, that's cool too. I remember Ravi doing that when I used to work for him a couple years ago. So, and yeah, that was cool. I think me and Karina were going to launch a AI thing for e-com for Shopify stuff. I know we were building a little bit of about two, but we never really launched it per se, except everyone still goes to the free version. But I get what you mean, like what would Maria say? Like, that is, it is powerful. 00:06:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, Yeah. Um, I was trying to figure out if I could figure out who I'm bear marketing was. Cause I remember there's this lady that's been around a long time also. 00:06:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And her name is Barb Ling. Oh, Barb Ling. Yeah. 00:06:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She goes by mama bear now. 00:06:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, oh, I thought she used to be just barbelling marketing or something. 00:06:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. might be, but she on Facebook now, she's mama bear B. Oh. 00:06:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, I'm a barbelling authority marketing coach. Yeah, she bought some stuff for me in the back of the day. And then she also, it was in the worry form of doing good offers. Like she's just a decent person, you know? that offers. 00:07:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm on her page and she doesn't say mama bear on her website but she just shows coffee. That's why I remember her. She's really in the coffee. That's right. 00:07:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) yeah, she says on apology baby blue word 23 plus year veteran marketer coffee appreciator moose wrangler and more virtual coach. yeah, she doesn't have mama bear anywhere here but you're right. Maybe she just recently really branded. 00:07:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, no, this is um, if you go to facebook.com slash mama bear entrepreneur. That's her. 00:07:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah, I would. 00:07:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, and I think that that's That's her old profile that she switched over. 00:08:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, Fred's. Oh, she can't use that because that's a personal page, not a business page. 00:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. And I can't switch mine to a professional page, not, not business, but professional. It's not an option for me, which is weird. 00:08:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Anyway, yeah. Yeah, I'm just shocked to see that it's not a page page. Did they take that functionality away? Because it used to be pretty easy that you could switch it over to a professional page. 00:08:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I don't know when I have more than 500 followers and half for a long time. 00:08:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So I don't know why I wouldn't be able to. But I mean, it's been years since I've had a client do that. But yeah, I'm going to try to get maybe there was a glitch. I always think something's not working that should work on Facebook. Then it's a glitch and go back next day and try. 00:08:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, any of it, I've been looking at it for months because. they have analytics now. 00:09:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And it's not a business page, it's a newer thing. It's not, it's gone. 00:09:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Anyway, um, so I want to be paying attention to the time with my brain. I did want to share with you though, one thing that Dan sent me, I'll just put it in the notes. Um, it's okay, I bought it, and I would share it with you if you wanted it, but um, hold on a second, gonna find chat here. Really inexpensive, and I think the only thing I'd probably use it for would be maybe some quick um, graphic type creation. I haven't gone through everything yet. their sales page, showed that they have some automations for graphics, but a lot of variety. And they do have AI. I'm playing with it to see. I don't like to finish products. don't think it's quality enough to be representative me, but I do think this type of stuff is sometimes good for repurposing old things. And one of the tests that I wanted to run was kind of a side-by-side faceless type of campaign to see what can be done because there's a lot of faceless marketing. People don't care about knowing, liking, and trusting if it's not a huge investment. They care about, are you teaching me something useful? And I got, I don't know if I still have it, businessprofessor.ai, where I would basically repurpose the same content and just change the voice a little bit to not necessarily be about the mom's side and the personal details as much, but still the same. The value of the content. tactics, principles, things like that, because the duplication shouldn't be that difficult if I get low cost, you know, assistant. And then if I'm duplicating it, but under a different brand sufficiently, it shouldn't be anything that's penalized and it would be like diversifying, basically. But it's an experiment I want to run because the audiences are so much bigger than they were, even just a few years ago, even pre-COVID. And it keeps growing this world of, you know, people wanting to side hustle, things like that. was thinking about, you know, even when I was a kid, my mom did, Mary Kay, Tupperware, Avon, what else did she do? But there was, women were selling things. And then there was, you know, the candles and the melaleuca and the amway and all that type of stuff. So, but now they've got the internet. I just think that it's, and the statistics are there, but there's just so many people to get to who aren't internet marketers per se, who are maybe they sell at the farmers market on the weekend. they could be taught about profit margins and simple things like that. So anyway, kind of thinking about how to expand stuff. Instead of, I always feel like I get trapped in the high ticket world and high value and high level. I, there's only, like I said, there's only so much of that you can do anyway, because high level clients require high level performance and investment. And so, you know, there's only a few of that. Everything else needs to be leveraged. And I just realized, like, there's a lot of people who know almost nothing and just to be able to teach them. So, anyway, those thoughts. But, and then, okay, so we were talking about potentially starting something with both of us as a kind of like a baseline foundation and being able to. And I mean, even at the same time, parallel, while we're not working together, kind of duplicate some of that work. Like, we could create a school group or a high level community that's similar and just start piping people in and figuring out a very low level schedule like where once a week we show up and answer questions. And, but because high level has rocking, like, let's say you make a reference from your existing group that you're building into this group, that link would be a tracking link. So those people are tracked from day one. So if those people buy anything, no matter what they buy, you get the higher level commission. And because like I have Facebook followers, that would just come in and do things. And we can decide if we want to create it as a free group or, you know, maybe it's $20 a month and it's low cost. And we're going to show up and talk to each other anyway. But how scalable is that? How many people would want to come in? I'm thinking volume of people who have trusted enough to give a credit card for $20 and to make a commitment for $20 a month. I think that could add up pretty quickly. But then, as we're talking to them every week, figure out, okay, what are you guys interested, what are you responding to? Where does the conversation not where does it consistently go? 00:15:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Let's offer that. 00:15:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let's make a training. Okay, this training is going to be $200 and this is what we're going to do. And we don't even have to like we can go run ads separately to bring people into that training. But if we have a group full of people who have already paid $20 a month and half of them have said, I really need to know this. And you and I know it doesn't matter what they want to know, we're going to be able to teach it quickly, live probably. And then provide some really good resources which we can take to VAs. I've got a ton of them of different sorts, video graphics, PDFs, all the works where we can take the live content that we made and then go make some pretty visual supports for them. And then that becomes an evergreen product that already exists in the members area. like, hey, you have this problem. Here's all our testimonials, these people. we give this to them and and you can have it now and it does not have to be a live training and if then you know if something goes really well we can say we'll do the live training again in a few months whatever if people want live more because they can do Q&A then we charge more that's the thing but there's so many different topics we could just do that on repeat but then so the Maria Tina version is always going to be a little different than just Maria riffing all by herself and just Tina riffing all by herself but especially if we really kind of like if it's a marketing question I'm glad Maria go at it and I'll have a little bit pieces and if it's a business management operations kind of stuff then I'll go at it and you contribute when you have a little something to say you might have a lot to say but if we agree that we're going to kind of let the other one shine in a particular area but give the other space and go So, yeah, I actually have really something good to contribute I want to share so that we get a well-rounded thing, know, so we're not competing, but we are kind of compartmentalizing so that we can establish separate brands under one roof for our personal benefits while still serving the community really well. I think that that could work and just flow, especially because I'm not going to get offended that if you've got some great ideas, I'm going like, that's awesome, and I can have eyes. 00:17:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think that's, there's something there, yeah, I can't get my full hand around it of all the tracking, know, because I also don't want to fall down from it, you know. 00:17:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It won't be hard, and we could ask Dan for it, but it won't be hard. It's really, all it is, is anybody that comes into us has to to be tracked once because the source tracking so they're either coming in from an ad that we did which we would be tracking where they're coming in from one of our personal links and we just need to make sure if we want credit for it right that each of those links are trackable so if you're you would just have one group or you could have multiple links and I would show you how to do it so that you know it and I could even set them up for you if you don't even want to touch it and just be like Maria this is it and we'll go do a test test like source right and make sure that they're tagged as came from Maria we'll just put Maria something like that right and then show you so then if that person makes a purchase we'll have to figure out how to how to do their reporting and the commission structure but for sure Dan would help with that and if he didn't do it for free I'd hire somebody to do it but high level does that really easily okay yeah that's one of the great benefits of it And if the community is in high level and the sales are in high level, it's all there. Yeah. So, yeah, it would actually be really not quite as simple as doing it without the tracking, but the tracking is not going to be difficult. 00:19:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. Well, that's cool. That's cool. So, and just on another note, when you brought up Designer, I shared screen real quick. 00:19:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I've been using it since 2016. 00:19:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah. 00:19:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let me share screen right now. 00:19:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, I don't, haven't used AI, AI, AI part. See that 2016, I created the e-commerce email promotions, like it's a product I used to sell, don't know, for like seven bucks, low ticket offer. that's really big. something's worth about it. Anyway, but yeah. and actually just the recent YouTube video that did really well, I made the product here, the 100 digital offers. So I made it obviously in chat should be T first and some of my own input. And then I used the template and just like put in my own graphic here of the screenshot. And then it's just super, super simple. 00:20:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's not as pretty as camera. 00:20:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) but it did the job and I needed done like in about 10 minutes before I put it in the community. See, I bought, I haven't pinpointed it yet. Where is marketing master account? need to re send it to my school community. But anyway, so yeah, that's cool. 00:20:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I've done that. I want to share something with you too so you can see I need to feed it more data to this library. 00:20:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) But what does Dan think? what we should be offering and all that stuff? he have any ideas input? Because sometimes I'm going to be honest, sometimes I get too confused. you know, when I start thinking about all the things, and maybe just because I'm not centered, because I haven't done my bible stuff here. 00:21:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Meditations are journaling this morning. I didn't ask him, but we could if you want to do, I think he is a massive Maria fan and Tina fan. So ask, ask, um, pretend you're a person that has a business question, fairly simple, um, about business operations or principles or strategies or even problem solving. Let's see how this AI does. 00:21:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, um, how do I get traffic from YouTube marketing? 00:21:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I haven't, it will be my kind of content, like, um, just, just not marketing specific, like, um, what should I pay my stuff? hiring people, how should I choose what to work on? um, yeah, pretty much anything that's not marketing strategy specific. 00:22:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) How could I get more productive in my business, family? 00:22:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I told you not to say, ah, would never say that. 00:22:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Look at that. It affects hourly rate now for the game changer. yeah. 00:23:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Now, go make that magic. 00:23:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) You got this. 00:23:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I mean, if for just being able to ask a question that that would give if somebody had never experienced that. Yeah, that we get them started. Anyway, so I haven't vetted all of my content yet, because you can only give it 10 files. So what I have to do, and I'm going to hire a VA to do this, is combine multiple transcripts into a single file, because it's not really, I don't know what the limit to the eyes of the files is, but I haven't anywhere near approached that. Okay, so just putting it into single files. And then I've also included the transcripts of testimonials from clients. Really long ones on YouTube that give details as to like what I can do for them. So anyway, yeah, just this. So I want to use this to when it's trained properly create short pieces of content for me based off of things I've already created and done. So if I want to pick a topic in any, I don't necessarily want to just use it as it comes out. For sure, I would edit some of these things all the time the struggle. No, that's no. Tell me your AI without telling me your AI that. But and take something, put some bones on it and go like, Oh, yeah, okay, well, tweet this, tweet this, even ask it a question because it's asking it from my library of vast library of information once I get all my calls in there and then be able to repurpose it according to okay well this is a Twitter post I wanted to and I know you can do threads on Twitter but if I wanted to make it shorter and make it like one line each so I can break it up into Instagram quotes and then go send it to a VA who plugs it into some images from you know really quickly there's like four and five dollar an hour VA is still that are good at Canva and I don't know if they're as fast as maybe eight or ten dollar VA's so that's an experiment I'm going to be playing with and I usually hire a couple people and just kind of try them against each other see what ends up being most profitable just because people are cheaper for our doesn't mean that they're cheaper for our. got it, got it. Yeah. So anyway, but yeah, um, what, what would help you get some clarity on the opportunity of what it would look like to do work together. Um, so that's, well, so that it's clear and then you can decide, do you want to put any mental energy into it or not. 00:26:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Um, I think, I think just like, so we got the free community, right? 00:26:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It can be free. It can be paid. It can be paid from, from the beginning, just low cost, like really low cost, but so that we know that we've got people who want to be there enough with their money, who have enough trust to pass over a credit card. 00:26:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay, so it's almost like, uh, I kind of do this when I. Great offers for people who share screen. know you got to go like a little minutes. Share screen. It'd be sort of is one that I've done with us for I'm possible. So basically like customer journey map like like like these are different. So like you know step one was micro offer magic you know then or about social group and five so step one could be like a community five bucks month. Maybe we make it like one buck a month or five bucks a month or whatever ten bucks a month and then what in their customer journey what is it like what step to what's that offer there and like what are we thinking right like what so we can kind of yeah so so like and if I go I don't know who else I've done a few of these four. or community. 00:28:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I have a quick idea for that the first variation. think the first version is you come into the community and we both have free pieces of content that they can consume so that they can get familiar with us and just kind of have a place and we encourage just talking. So it's basically another version of an email list, kind of. We can communicate with them. But it's in a place where so high level has an app, I think. And it's like lead something, whatever. But it's mobile and they have magic links so that people can open some things right from their email and go straight to the paid member area. And I'm OK with using school and paying for that too, if they need me. for sure, we'd want to charge like $5 a month or something. The first level is, we're going to put in lots of our content, pre-existing content, and you have access to it, and then the second level could be also not very much, and it could be either, like for me, could be they get the profit time, energy maximizer, and maybe one of your products, that is a paid product, but low cost. In addition, we'll have weekly meetings and you can show up to it, and so we maybe put the recordings in the free group, but they don't get to ask questions unless they're in the paid group, or in the like the five dollar month group, they get recordings, and let's say $20 or $40 a month group, you can come in and ask questions and we will answer your questions. So, the lower level group is you get our content, not our time. The next level up is you get our content and our time. And the next level up could be something much more high level once we figure out and we start talking to people. 00:30:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Good. 00:30:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) else are you going to go get 20 year veterans in business, women, know, that have been online veterans. It's not very, it's not easy to find. 00:30:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) No, I know I'm going to have an analyze them and I probably should join their community. 00:30:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) If I go to school discovery. 00:30:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) There's one woman that. I imagine in this grandma is making a lot and has all these people in that community. It's really right at the top of your digital growth community. It's number one for engagement and yeah, she's got. You know, you you you know, to build a daily pay customer base digitally. 00:31:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 39,000 members and what's the cost? 00:31:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) This one might be her free group, let's see, proven six-figure. 00:31:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) says paid. 00:31:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Where? Right there. yeah, but here, because there's joint group, okay. So, yeah, what email did you use to purchase? Okay, so she's then selling it via sales page, okay. Only how people to pay the joint here, live weekly mentoring support, giving monthly networking events, zero of six-figure online is six months. That's her promise. She looks really good, actually. That's fine, I don't know her name is. Payment methods. Are you saying that? 00:31:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) what's right there. 00:31:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Are you early, 423? And she's new system IO, isn't it, she's system Ha ha. That's her name. And she has any love us? 00:32:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How many do you have math real quick? 39, what was the note was 47? Yeah, so 39,000 times 47. That's 829,000 a month. 00:32:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Holy crap. 00:32:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And it's more than that because it's almost 40,000. 00:32:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So road map to attract daily pay customers digitally, build an impactful email list, create a well-known brand and proven six figures in six months formula. 00:32:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So my thing about wanting to do this stuff together is that both you and I have gone to the point where, and because we can still, like I said, have our separate stuff and feed it so that you're not risking building everything around me. And vice versa, not that I'm even worried about it, but that's just this smart thing to do because anything can happen, right? But the roadblocks that both of us will have, we'll get to them so much faster. We'll doing something together. And I mean, I'm all about leverage. To me, it would be so leverage because we have different skill sets, but we have very similar skill sets too. And one of them is so few people just show up and work all the time. And I don't mean all the time. don't actually work all the time, but I show up every day. I move the needle every day. lot of people, most people honestly, really don't do that. I've worked with tons of people. There's a lot of inconsistency, even with high-level performers, because they burn themselves out. so it cycles a burnout. I don't get burnt out. I don't let burnout happen to me. Because I nap. A lot. I can nap three times a day. I will nap three times day if that's what it takes. You feel good. I take time off. I take little trips like so and I don't work long hours, but yeah, I do show up consistently. I pay for help. I pay for good help. I train good. Most people pay for help. And then they don't train well. And so it's not useful. I'm not getting any help. I dig in and I get to thorough training quickly. Screen sharing, video sharing, then so we're doing it together. I'm showing you and then you tell, you show me that you can do it. And then you go be released to do the work. And we have constant communication and feedback. So like, some people, most people abdicate. 00:34:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I delegate. Yeah. 00:34:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) and they think that they're delegating, but they're abdicating anyway. And now your brain is always considering about marketing and offers. I hate starting there. also, you, yeah, I mean, you just love the part that I like. 00:35:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) to go about a lot. 00:35:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And I think where you have friction is clarity and should it be this or this and also anchoring because if you're trying something every month and that's your habit that I know that it's just your tendency to kind of bounce around. So what you would need support with is how does your spirit get the freedom to explore? Because obviously that's important to you. Without that sabotaging what you're already doing by distracting you too much. You get to play and get that outlet but you've got somebody helping you go okay. Now that you've played you have to make a decision. Do you keep playing there or can you bring something back to here because this is what you chose first or are you switching and if you're switching be real clear about why you're switching and make sure that it's aligning with your values because Sometimes we need permission to switch, and we give ourselves permission, right? Sometimes that's the thing to do too, but that logical conversation, I can have in my sleep. Yeah. You get really clear and really confident and peaceful, because that's the part that slows things down is trying to figure it out, you know, do what I want to do and don't I want to do it. And the usually it's a why, but sometimes that why is not very clear. And so the probing questions that have you get to that why, that's what I'm really gonna add. 00:36:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. Okay. I love based on what we just saw. I think we just have one community that's a little ticket, maybe start at $5 and bring it up to $47 and be like that girl. Like I think we just saw maybe a path. 00:36:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:36:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Sorry. Between the two of us like there's like, yeah, like people get so much value out of it. 00:36:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's what I was thinking something about too is just starting. really level and bringing it up and be like, okay, the price is increasing, the price is increasing until we get to kind of a place where the conversions drop and we keep increasing it. That way we can get numbers in because there's nothing like an empty group trying to talk to an empty group. And then we learn as we grow, but I think that that's the rocket fuel is getting the people to come in and tell us how we can serve them that were already attracted to us for whatever reason at a low level cost. And then we serve them really well and we can let them be grandfathered in or say, you get this price for this next year, but for this year, you know, but next year we're raising prices because in place and whatever, nobody, yeah, groceries don't get it locked in, rent rarely doesn't like occasionally, but most things in class. Yeah. got it. So I think the next steps would be to to kind of create like a very simple map like that, right? what the offer is and what the content would be. So like, I think if I have that profit time, energy maximizer to serve to the community, I feel like you think number one, I feel like I've brought a valuable contribution that earns whatever my low level portion of it is, right? And I'll keep bringing it. You bring something of yours. And but that's impactful that you know that they're going to go. Something is going to be they'll have an aha moment or something tactical that they can implement right away, but not your best stuff, right? And then we just put together an offer put together some graphics and images and start piping people in for $5 the first time for like, and Honestly, we'll see that the issue with school is that there's a few issues. First of all, people can very easily see how much you're making and how much money you have because of how many people are in your group and what your paid price is. Yeah, that's just one thing. Competitors, whatever. There's that. School does pipe people in, but you can only charge one price a month per group. So if you raise the price, you can't let one group. If you charge it through school, so what she did was she charged off-site and let them in for free or however it worked out, but because school only lets you charge one price per person. So if you say it's $5 for you guys, but it's $35 for you guys, you can't do that. 00:39:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) School, I'll let you do that. 00:39:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So anyway... We would just have to figure out the tactical approach around that and she does it, which is charging the money off of school and then letting them into it. 00:40:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, yeah, stuff to think about, yeah, all right, we'll have fun. Okay, you're going to your, your study? 00:40:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, I'm late, it's a missionary training, but they record it so I can still get it. maria@mariagudelis.comTina MarieMaria & Tina🪄
00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hello, how are you? 00:00:12 - Dan Ryan (3) Cleaners day and up on the poetry of my various furry friends. 00:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I like it. 00:00:21 - Dan Ryan (3) Doing calls, doing meetings, look out. 00:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's good, it's good. I got a full night's sleep and groceries just got delivered. My older daughter took my younger daughter to seminary and she's making dinner tonight. And there's a flipping spider on my ceiling. Hopefully I must go with this. A comment? I don't want to get it. I don't like spiders. But I am the only spider killer. I guess you get to live for a while. I don't feel like dealing with it. 00:00:59 - Dan Ryan (3) I don't want to live. 00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's, it's no spiders. Anyway, what, uh, was it a work call you had just now? 00:01:12 - Dan Ryan (3) Two, then I, uh, talked to developers at, uh, SOD at nine, and then I just had a meeting with Circle, because I was like, you know what, I'm going to look at these other community platforms, and I'm officially sold on Circle, Tina. It is. 00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Really? Yeah. Taylor, well, to agree with you. 00:01:35 - Dan Ryan (3) Uh, okay. Uh, probably not for the reasons. I'm sure Taylor really didn't evaluate it and just copy Brandon Burshaw or something. Uh, I'm like talking to the guy like, okay, what if I want to send a, you know, I didn't, I was like, I have a CRM and what if I want to send people over from my CRM? So they're going to opt in. through this lead thing, and that's where I'm going to send them emails, and that's where I'm going to make offers and pitch ship and, right, because they don't really have massive email or whatever. mean, yeah, I don't think they even have it. And I go, and then I want to get them over and I want to tag them with the three things that I'm collecting in the form. He's like, yep, API, don't use apps. I go, okay, great, that could be that. And then I was like, all right, let's say I want to have a free level, and then I want to have different paid tiers. So let's have paid tier one is like a group coaching thing, or whatever, or, or it's one on one coaching, or let's say I want to do a cohort. So there's like a six week cohort. He's like, let me show you, opens up all these sites. He's like, you can do everything you just said. was like, God damn, really? It's like, okay, how do I generate the payment? it's like the payments here. You can make it. a month to month. So you can make it a full page, you can make it a month to month. You've got a link at the end. Okay, so I have that link. So if I'm on a sales call, for example, I can downsell to the page, that payment plan is ID up, and you just send in this link, I know it's in the link through the fee around, I go, okay, what if I want to, what if I want to take, I got this is further down the I go, if I want to take activity from, from circle and update my record in my CRM. So using mom as an example, I met with him and I talked about Ninja and mom. Not so much because I thought I would use it for Ninja, but he literally, the reason I said Brendan Bouchard is because he showed me Brendan's thing. So what they're releasing right now is a headless API, that you can take circle components and put it inside. Buddy balls, basically. So when he opened up Brendan's side, And was like, that's body boss. And he's like, it is? And he's yep. But he's like, well, that's what Brent. And he's like, I don't know who he's doing it for him. But he's like, they're doing it. So see, they had circles just iframed inside body boss, which looked good, as a matter of fact. And but now you can take components, like the feed component, and then have that in there. And your users are in body boss, but you're using circle. And I was like, he's like, so you don't have to pay millions of dollars to develop these widgets, because you can use ours. I'm like, oh, that's dope. I didn't know you could do that. He's like, it's not out. It's coming out like two weeks. He's like, you're just showing me because it sounds like you would get it. I definitely get it. So then Brendan's got someone doing it for him. 00:04:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like, I'm pretty sure I can find out who did that. 00:04:50 - Dan Ryan (3) And then go talk to them. So yeah, I'm like, man, this is high levels. They're never going to catch up. of this. Schools never going to catch up to this. Like, these guys are way, way further ahead. 00:05:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, but I went and just got that snapshot yesterday. 00:05:09 - Dan Ryan (3) That's okay, because I do still think like you could do the sales calls. 00:05:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Wait, you got what's natural? Community one that you showed me. 00:05:18 - Dan Ryan (3) I think that can work. I do think that can work still, but for mom, because mom to me is going to be extremely complicated. So it's going to have, it's going to have all the things that I just said. You want a free tier, then you want a paid tier, then you want a government tier, then you want a dedicated error for fan flow users, then you want a dedicated area for people that are in. But we're, I don't know if this is going to be the name, but we have this continuous release strategy. So it'd be like, hey, no, you're going to pay to be in the continuous release strategy cohort. One, which starts in January, two starts in February 3 starts in March, and in that group, you are releasing a song every 8 to 12 weeks with whoever's in that 20-person cohort, whatever. So those would all need to be separate paid tiers and separate private groups. And I'm like, yeah, so at that level, I love them, right? I don't know. have no idea. 00:06:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think you leave it out with the communities, because if you can't do that, then that would be a deal breaker for me too, because I want multiple tiers. And one thing that Circle can do that I don't know if you came across it, but it gives you stats of who's logged in and what information they've consumed. 00:06:48 - Dan Ryan (3) Yeah, you have to actually build some of that, he showed me that. Yeah. Interesting. The other thing that they have that is perfect for mom is spotify interest. I was like, oh, that's dope, and then they do mp3s, which we need, which high level doesn't support. So I was like, okay, but it's also like, you could do this headless thing and put it inside of high level. I was like, oh, that would be interesting. So you can still use high level and then just have circle inside of high level and he showed me another version of that. And it was just like the E card and he was saying, yeah, if you owe off, he kind of lost me. It was not super off on oh off, but he's like, imagine you just owe off your high level log in that you give them. It's the exact same log in for circles and they log in high level, they log in circle, they just don't know. It's like, yeah, that would be great. So yeah, but I'm not totally sold, but I was like, oh. of this headless API is super interesting. 00:08:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What is a headless API? 00:08:08 - Dan Ryan (3) I mean, it's like you're not you're not using the wrapper, right? So you're not using the container of it of circle. So you're using the compound, you're getting access to the components. You can do with WordPress too. So it's like, it's super lightweight. There's not a lot of other code. It's just a thing. It's fairly new. I hadn't really ever heard. I'd heard of it for WordPress. I had not heard of it for like one of these standalone softwares that was surprisingly said that I was like, oh, okay. I did not see that coming. 00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Interesting. Maybe. Oh, 00:09:00 - Dan Ryan (3) But I'm looking at it more for, because we've been talking to these dudes grooved for the bands. So then I was like, I don't like those guys. And there's no way they're going to catch up to any of these people's school. You know, whether it's school or circle or it might be networks. But these guys are starting out and they're not even called Pepsi Sprite. They're nothing. They're like Fanta. They're never going to. But they're trying to target just musicians. that's sort of the value problem. But tech wise, they're texting. 00:09:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Who's texting? 00:09:45 - Dan Ryan (3) They're called groups. 00:09:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I was like, wait, what is the group? 00:09:53 - Dan Ryan (3) Okay, never run. Yeah, but it's the, it's those, I mean, props. It's those TikTok influencers. They're like, they got so much reach on TikTok. now they're like, oh, we do communities for all audiences. And they've gotten some of the biggest TikTokers to be on the platform. And they're, they're using that to attract other people. But the problem is the software itself stinks because it's a bunch of TikTokers developing software. Like, yeah, it's not good. It's not going to go well long term. 00:10:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think the, um, man, it's always so complex. There's so many things that have to be measured. So like the speed of implementation. So school is super fast to implement. That's really, to me, the only draw about it. There's a lot of drawbacks, including analytics, you have to pay for every community, um, they don't integrate, the communities don't integrate with each other really well, where you could do that with like circle. I think Circle is pretty quick to integrate, but also has a lot of complex features that you could do and it doesn't have a native app, but it does have an app. So that's good. You don't know if it has a magic link, which I think is really good for people that don't want to use the app and just want to be able to go straight to their content without having to log in and remember a password because a lot of people don't use password managers and they don't have an efficient login process. Yeah. But what I'm looking at in this high level community is it is convoluted. That was my issue with high level to begin with is that it's convoluted. It's there's. It's not pointing click. You know what I mean? It's not intuitive. And then same with Buddy Boss was the same thing. 00:11:51 - Dan Ryan (3) So yeah, Buddy Boss is not intuitive at all. 00:11:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) no, you've got to have somebody who knows exactly what they're doing. And that is. 00:12:00 - Dan Ryan (3) Not super easy to come by thing Yeah, what you need is like well, I mean, I think you got right the snapshot for high level is gonna have Hey do this or it's gonna build a bunching for you You would need something like that force you would need something like that for circle too But there's no snapshots right it's gonna be Build and you'd need someone that like he took me in a community that was clearly a coach and then doing individual coaching so like You would have like a damn thing so when I log into circle as like Let's say I'm like so I'm your high ticket level right so it's like you log in I'm high ticket I get access to everything like the courses or all the logs for me, but then I also have a dedicated damn coaching in the area they call it a coaching, but it's not literally the coaching area. And then inside that you could have Dan, Mark, blah, blah, blah, but Mark can't see Dan and Dan can't see Mark. So all I see under coaching is Dan. And then it's a dedicated stream of Dan and Tina. I was like that's interesting not be group. 00:13:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He goes, yeah. 00:13:25 - Dan Ryan (3) Okay, I didn't see I didn't see that coming. I can say in the video, I asked him to send me the recording. 00:13:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's all it's interesting. So what are your priorities for the membership for mom? 00:13:45 - Dan Ryan (3) So I've already proven I can generate a lead for under two dollars. And then they I think like 80% of them opted to join the Facebook group. But now I'm like, okay, I can just force and I can ask them if they want to join the community, if they assent, yes, and I can automatically go create the record in wherever I can do it in high level, I can do it in a circle. So then I go automatically create that record. So I'm not just putting in everyone, I'm putting in all the people that say yes, and then I'm tagging them as whatever, yes. And then the people that say no, I'm tagging them as no to invite them later. And then you would deliver potentially deliver the thing through the group and through email. So they're opting in, think I did two of the things I did, royalty release checklist and I did, no, I'm sorry, did a royalties checklist and then a release checklist. So they could get the thing in the group, or they could get the thing in the email either way. then ultimately they're for each, now we're going to Fletcher, if each thing is actually tied to a course, then you could sell them the course and deliver the course inside wherever, wherever that can be used. Then you have a free community that's just a bunch of people that are in the independent music space. And then I'm tagging them based on the first things that they tell me and then you'd enrich that, we let them enrich that through their profile, right? So the only thing I really ask them on the way in is what are you? And they're either a producer, engineer, an artist, a band, where those options are. So you would immediately be able to identify someone who's a band, come on up on that, possibly genre, and then you'd give them the ability to, hey, this is my Spotify thing. Because part of me has been mutilating, I forget who did this back in the day. I think it might have been Justin or somebody else. But... it was like in the community, they would go juice people's Facebook posts, right? just put up this ad, can you guys go like it? And then a bunch of people would just go like the ad and back at that time, that was an indicator to push the ad further for Facebook. So it was like the community was participating in juicing other things within the community. So my version of it is like, you earn credits. So you can, if you do it, you get a credit. And then you can then, once you have that credit, that credit can be spent when it's time to promote your song. It's like, okay, you have 10 credits, so you can now get 10 clicks. Something like that. So when someone released this song, it's Spotify. It's like, hey, my song's out, Ghost Treatment. That's the signal to Spotify. People are interacting, it's Ghost Treatment, whatever else, whatever the things are. So, or you don't do that. It's just that. community is supporting, right? I came and released this out, and one go go support it. 00:17:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, um, I don't know. They're so whatever. So, the circle has like gamification features in there. I think you're what you were talking about that they do actually. 00:17:28 - Dan Ryan (3) But they have, they have a bad game and stuff, but it's not game. It's not game. It's your, you decide. So you can build an automation in the background that hands out badges and stuff. It's not, it's not like built in. It's your user. So you could be like, completed the cohort completed the course that he showed me that those are these options. Automations that you build. There's nothing made of. That's like, oh yeah, we automatically have this game of occasion component. Hmm. Yeah. 00:18:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, but and I don't know all the different ways that you could do it, but the idea that you have where the community supports each other with those credits for like listening to songs, downloading songs, whatever. I don't know. But I don't know that I heard the answer for like, like, if you were going to rank, first of all, if you were going to list the features that you want and then rank them, but I guess it doesn't matter if you found a solution that does everything that you want, but in the search for things, if you hadn't found everything, I would be curious to know what were the things that you had been looking for. 00:18:56 - Dan Ryan (3) So, was it my list? 00:18:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) it was Marx. 00:19:00 - Dan Ryan (3) So, Mark was always shooting down this or the other so like the last thing he sent was oh MP3 and then not sport it was like do beyond having a dream and like yeah, we do That's kind of a deal breaker for a music community because everyone's dealing in mp3 or mp4 so there's no music no music in bed and and then Circle also just happen on Spotify. was like oh, that's even better But not or not because when you're when you're in the pre-production phase Imagine you're in a group that's producing it while I'm working on a producing a song to be released You can only have mp3s of that while you're saying okay. Here's the first mix. It's gonna be an mp3 It's not it's not publicly available. You could put it on SoundCloud, but you probably don't want to It did have a SoundCloud integration too, which I was like god damn really but So yeah, Mark, it was that and it was he doesn't like when you put a video in, he wanted like a full full video post, I love Facebook and school doesn't do that, high level doesn't do that. So that was more of like just a UI sort of thing. School doesn't do it and high level is copying school, so therefore they don't do it. Circle doesn't. Mighty networks did it. Then as far as like, then there was just having the different, the pride of any sort of paywall, right, so I don't know school has a paywall. So having the free thing and then a paywall. 00:20:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So yeah, I think I like this. It's one or the other. You can either have a free group or a paid group, but you cannot have two tiers. 00:21:00 - Dan Ryan (3) Oh, see, school, you can have like nine, you can have unlimited tears. You mean circle? Um, circle, yeah. Um, and then the main thing he doesn't like about high level is it's built around courses, as opposed to being courses is part of it. So it's not really community, it's courses plus community, and he wants community first, there might never be courses, right? So what if, especially if you're dealing with just a band, a band is never going to have a course ever. Right. So he's like, we tried to, he's actually building community and more on that, um, trying to see how it goes. But that was the main sticking point is that it's like, uh, he's like, no, that doesn't fit for a band. What is a band teaching someone? 00:21:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's like, no, you're right. 00:21:57 - Dan Ryan (3) But I was like, we could use this for mom. He could put our core like it totally fits for forces first teaching first community second, but the this scenario is completely flip-flop. It's community first forces second. like, okay, then it makes sense. I mean, I guess that's probably the best way to look at it is that. Yeah, it's it's it's need community forward, not forces forward. So I like I went through this dude. 00:22:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I took him through like ninja explain what ninja was.-hmm. 00:22:37 - Dan Ryan (3) it was like the ninja falls apart with our MCQ product. He's like, yeah, no. like, you're you'd never be like, he's like, I'm not saying you can't you have developers probably could. But he's like, then that's when he showed me Brandon Bouchard's thing and I said, was like, that's buddy boss. I was like, oh, okay, that's kind of interesting. So we could head this. BPS circle into because I think buddy bosses community stuff stinks It's like oh This could be better And then we can do the stuff like you know, we log them into our MCQ software from within buddy boss They don't know that they left. 00:23:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He's like, oh, never gonna be able to do that Yeah, For me and and and also why which I know you think is proactive avoidance, but for me, it's really it's it's tactical learning Because it's hard for me to comprehend the user experience without having the user experience and Trying to create a list of what are the features that matter most like I can think of some things for me The course is the most important thing but community is really important as well because Because if I can leverage the conversation of other people in the community to kind of create almost like a gravitational pull towards the content, because there's also other people there. but but then you don't even know until you've done it does that work or not, you know, yeah, and so it's all theoretical. And it's just, it's just thoughts upon thoughts upon thoughts until you do it and experience it. And that's the biggest thing is that I, um, whatever, I think if the list of the main things are there, then whatever else trade offs that you make, like, we know nothing's going to be perfect. But as long as the main features that you need are there and they're solid, then, you know, you don't have to move. But if you do move. I don't know, it's a whole nother thing. It's so hard just trying to build on something. 00:25:07 - Dan Ryan (3) And also for you, you're like going top down. You might never get down, right? if you're currently at high ticket. 00:25:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Explain what you mean down. 00:25:17 - Dan Ryan (3) Right, so the opposite would be free low ticket, mid ticket, high ticket, right? And you're at high ticket. So community is really more for the free, right? 00:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's where the community still is going Agreed. 00:25:31 - Dan Ryan (3) So if you had me and Mark and someone's in Quasimodo or whatever that guy's name is, like, if they were all... 00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, wait, wait, who's Quasimodo? I don't know, but the doctor. Oh, Boogie. Boogie. 00:25:44 - Dan Ryan (3) So if like me and Mark, right? If you're trying clients, we're in a community. 00:25:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We're not going to go in the community. 00:25:53 - Dan Ryan (3) No. No, I might go in there, I might go in there because there's something there for me, right? Right. You're like, hey, log in. I need you to log in and watch this video. Like we're going to talk about this next week. Yeah, I'm going to be in there for that. And so there, but there might be some discussion. I could see Mark, you know, Mark loves to talk, right? And me too, right? I might comment back to someone, right, in that context. we're not going to get in this back and forth discussion. 00:26:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, I wouldn't even have my high level clients would never be there. Because first of all, I'm not giving somebody access to all my people, right? And be like, hey, guess what? These are all the people for you to try to coach or something like that. I'm not really afraid of it. It's just kind of the thing that I have embedded in my mind because of the texture. But also, it's super high touch. Like why would I downgrade our interaction? 00:26:45 - Dan Ryan (3) Well, I'm not saying it's to downgrade. 00:26:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So my point was that you have those people. 00:26:50 - Dan Ryan (3) And yeah, you could be like, hey, the stuff's here. And I would go do this thing, right? And then when you go down to the next level, and what is the next level? The next level is like course buyers. Even them, even them, whoever they are, it's not going to be super cheap, but it's still going to be whatever. And a lot of what your stuff teaches them is antithetical to wasting time in the community, right? It'd be like, you need to be in your business. So I don't see you ever going down to this tier where there's like, just community, right? Like, like, what's exactly what's going to happen to my mom? Mom's going to start. We're going to try and turn free people into customers. 00:27:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You're not. No, I am. I am. And here's why, because it's more of a kind of give back type of thing. It's not about the logical approach to getting high level clients, although it does happen because I'm that person. And I've seen other people do it where they go buy the free thing, really high level people and just go like, oh, they know what they're talking about. But then they circumvent it. They don't go by the course or do anything else like that. They're like, hey, how do I hire you, that type of thing. But for me, it's the long term play, right? It's the ascension. It might take two, three, four, five years for somebody to get to, they become a high level client, but I've been teaching them the whole time. And it's also more of instead of having a blog where it's just one-sided and or instead of sending out emails, it's just a content home. It's a content medium source, and that, for me, is more about energy. It just feels like, right? It's not different. Email would work just as well. A blog could work just as well, Facebook just as well. It's just a preference of psychologically what it feels like to put it inside of something called a community. You know what I mean? Yeah. But then are you going to go like live once a week, teeny hours, like, so I'm not doing it by myself. I'm going to do this with Maria. 00:29:10 - Dan Ryan (3) She loves this. This is what I saw in one of groups like, so one of the groups that he showed me was for Alcatraz North, and I might have been with him, to be honest, and that I could see like, you know, their calendar or whatever, what I was going to get. Yeah. So I imagine they are doing that. They're saying, hey, get in on this on a time block freebie. And then, you know, then they're in the community and you go from there. 00:29:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Um, exactly that we, and I've been talking about it with her because, so she bounces all over the place. 00:29:47 - Dan Ryan (3) That's her biggest issue. 00:29:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I hardly noticed that about her. And my biggest issue is I don't want to be on video. I don't want to do all these things, but they're really good at drawing in people fast because you can connect. Now, I don't, it's not that I mind being on video so much, it's just, I don't want to talk to myself or talk to a camera. It's just so weird. And it's so, I'll have human conversations all day long. So I want to have somebody to talk to and do it with, and I want somebody else's brain that I can access frequently. And so, anyway, if we do it with, she needs all the conversation, wants to have all the conversations. And she does marketing, I do business operations, all the mental stuff. So it's a really good blend. And that's been a huge other part of reason why I haven't done this because I'm like, I don't want to do it by myself. I've never wanted to do it by myself. I do enjoy the community. do enjoy people. love teaching, answering questions. don't even mind having live conversat

Hello.
00:00:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Hey, Tina.
00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, how are you?
00:00:10 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Good.
00:00:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. good. So it'll just be us, not Patrick today, because he's on vacation and he just messaged last night about it.
00:00:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:00:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's all you, all the focus on you today.
00:00:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Nice. Sorry.
00:00:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How, how was it gone since last week? Any thoughts and ponderings about what we talked about before we get to like the tasks and assignments?
00:00:47 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, I just kind of went ahead and did it. I met with all my team members one on one.
00:00:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tell me about that.
00:00:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, it went well. Had a. Very well, you know, the whole reason I wanted to do it was to me with a very anyway, but she ended up being sick so I didn't get clearance of this morning It was good I got some good feedback the way I structured it I kind of like Asked them how they were doing and of course they gave me the generic answers, you know pretty good or you know Happy or whatever and then I got a little further asked them what their biggest stress was Right now and I got some good answers and then So usually it was like on the client side and then as I gave it we discussed that different solutions we could come up with and Then asked them, you know, what about the firm from the firm side you're experiencing stresses that I could help you relieve or any anything that we can do. so I got some good feedback on that as well. And then I set some goals with them. I wanted to have three goals for the next month for each one of them. So we set some goals. And then for coaching, I finished with coaching points. I just kind of went through a couple of things I noticed, but it kept it really positive.
00:02:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what I would love to do, what I think would be super insightful and helpful, is just to go over those in details for you to share what it was like, what you learned, your read on them, how they felt. Because like I said in the beginning, it's really an information. gathering process. So, basically, imagine you have, have you ever played with Legos? Okay, so you're dumping out all the Legos and you're basically taking inventory, and let's say you're doing something where you're just building it from your mind, not necessarily from a plan or schematic, and so you're figuring out what you've got to work with, so you can kind of build in your mind first, knowing what pieces you're working with. So, you know, some of the pieces are the people, but inside the people, so let's say the people are colors, and one's red, but there's different shapes of red, and one's yellow, but there's different shapes of yellow, and each of the different shapes would be their different skills, talents, abilities, weaknesses, any of those things, right? So, we're really just figuring out what do we have to build with, and it will be the people and all the nuance inside of them, and then it'll also be, obviously, the combination, like, where. not just building a red thing or a yellow thing, but so if we're, you know, we could do that together so that we're leveraging, you know, both of our different skill sets and see what we can come up with. What you think about that?
00:04:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I think be great. Yeah, I think initially, you know, I was a safe space. know, I wasn't like evaluating him for their next raise or anything like that.
00:04:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure.
00:04:39 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
But I think, yeah, that's what that's where I want to go. I want to be able to use these one ones as like, you know, a growth audience experience.
00:04:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel like um, very was a little bit more open this time with that intention that you set? Do you feel like she
00:05:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
end up at all more than normal. Yeah, a little bit. So, you know, what, it was a little bit different with her because I knew that that was one of the points we have touched on last last time we met. And so I made sure to emphasize the fact that, you know, this is a safe space, you know, I know that, you know, you know, I worked and passed four terms where anytime you were a little bit vulnerable, that was used as to, you know, those weaponized against you, then down the line. And I wanted to make sure I wanted to make clear that this wasn't this. This was just a way for me to, to be in touch with her and understand how I could support her, how I could help her. Set goals and how I could make sure she was happy here. And so you said that explicitly? Yeah.
00:06:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how did now reading both energy expression and words, how was that received?
00:06:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I could like, I could see her body language, she relaxed a lot more.
00:06:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She is way more like, almost like her shoulders when come up here. It's like down here is choosing. You know how big that is for that to happen. So you know what that means is that she trusts you that what you say is true. Yeah, she had an immediate response. What you said she trusted. That's, it's really important for you to understand that, that how to forgive me. Sometimes I get emotional when I think about people and our hearts and our spirits. and the things that we're going through because we are we are people and this is a big deal and our fears are a big deal our traumas are a big deal and they show up everywhere they show up in the workplace so when a person by default does not feel safe for them to come into contact with a person who can tell them they're safe and they believe it that is very powerful and I want you to remember what I told you about how you can be a different person for these people do you remember what I told you about yourself? I remember we talked about how I could be the safest person to these people because you are safe because you are kind because you do care um not Not because you just want to be that way, but I was pointing out to you that you actually are that way. And so what I want to show to you is now you've received a validation that is in Tina's just making an opinion and she doesn't know me, but she's guessing that these things. You just got validation from somebody that you've been working with, because that physical symbol of shoulders dropping and you can see that she relaxed 100% validates what I said is that you are perceived as safe. However, what I want you to also understand is that a lot of times we can do things somewhat obscurely and meaning that it's not crystal clear. Obviously, I know you know what obscure means, but I want to elaborate on my meaning. You can get a sense of something that you haven't dug into. you. So you haven't specifically identified it and brought it into crystal clear view. For example, Viri could may have sensed that you're a safe person, but you didn't give a clear enough signal to her to say, I am a safe person. I want you to feel safe. And so she felt it, but she didn't believe it per se. And generally speaking, we can feel safe around people, not know that they're safe for a very long time. And especially if you have the experience that you have trusted people in the past, and then they haven't been safe, you're going to doubt that your perception is accurate anyway. So she was able to pair her internal and intuitive perception of you being safe with your words confirming it. she believed it immediately. Hence, the physical experience and vision. visual symbol that she had relaxed and leaned into her the little bit. Does that make sense?
00:10:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, yeah.
00:10:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I want you to understand how powerful that is, because if you know that about yourself, Lorenz, then, but also if you know that there are people like Viri, and there's many, many, many, many, many of them, the majority, who don't feel like people that they are supporting that too in any kind of way are safe, who may not feel like men in the workplace are safe, or any of that, that you can give them a clear signal, I'm safe for you. I want you to feel safe. How you feel is important to me. want you to communicate what you need, what you think, It matters to me. I value your opinion. I value your presence on the team. I value, I mean, it could be your children. It could be other people in other places in your life. But you have because you are kind, because you care, but also because you're intelligent and because you have a good work ethic. That makes you rare. That's not the average person, friends. I've worked with so many people and I was just born weird watching people and intuitively recognizing them. I had grown people speaking to me as a child, forgetting that I was a child, talking to me and unburdening.
00:11:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, I'm not normal either.
00:11:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I've learned to recognize people and I speak boldly because I'm open to the fact that that I could be wrong, but I haven't been yet, and I won't be surprised when I am, well, I probably will be surprised when I'm wrong, but not because of me, but because of people and because of patterns and because of consistency. People really do give a lot of signals.
00:12:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's just most people aren't looking for them.
00:12:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm always looking for them. That's part of my bad for me, have actually become a superpower, which is actually true for a lot of people.
00:12:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So anyway, that's just all that interesting talking to you because like as an introvert, it's sometimes hard for you to express what I'm thinking, but it sounds like you're kind of like you can kind of interpret it before I can get the right words out.
00:12:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And it may not surprise you, but that's actually, I think it's probably one of my favorite gifts. And I get told that a lot is that there are things that people think. And they maybe have never even put it towards themselves yet. But I say it and I'm like, Oh, that's exactly what I was thinking. Or that's what I was feeling or like I had that awareness or whatever. So what you gave to me, even though I've already received it, it always helps me to receive that validation. So what I'd like you to keep in mind too, is that you have the ability to give validation to other people as well. And to take it when you receive it, because that is it's power. It gives people more confidence when they get a clear signal that this is true. So do you re needed that you gave a tour? And she gave you a clear signal of what I told you is that you are uniquely considered safe and trustworthy. So Oh, you told her you were safe because you were already received as trustworthy, she believed it. So those are two signals about yourself that were really important to receive. And I promise you, she's not the only one that thinks that. So that's really important and awesome and good job. Like, I didn't think that would be that fast, but that's how great you are. it does me no good to patronize or placate people. Anyway, if that would be counterproductive, I'd be out of a job very quickly because it'd be the emperor has their clothes.
00:14:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You know what I mean?
00:14:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So I really, I really am impressed that you were able to have one conversation and watch shoulders drop. That specific signal is really, really potent. Wow, I also couldn't even like apply on the wall and watch that happen. That'd be amazing. Okay, so go ahead.
00:15:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It was pretty, you know, a pre rewarding conversation. think she's, you know, she has so much to bring to the team and I've been frustrated with, you know, not being able to suss that out. I'm excited for the next few weeks to see how she kind of grows and is able to kind of trust me as an attorney and can bring her own input to our team.
00:15:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. I am so excited about that also, but I want to remind you, though, that she will need the consistency. So she'll need those signals again and again and again, because a lot of times people will declare who they are with their words, but it's when they support what they declare through their actions that we really know for sure. And I'm sure that you've already told her, like I said, she probably sensed it. This was just. the confirmation. But my point is that you'll want to reiterate that either explicitly or implicitly in the conversation that you have, even just saying things like, I'm so glad that we're opening up a little bit more and talking because I value what you say, just moving right along. not having to make a big thing about it, but a tiny little signal that I met what I said, this is on my mind, this is real, you know, let's keep going. And when she does say something, and it was, you know, more than what you would have expected before, I was just like, wow, I'm so glad that you're sharing more because I really feel like I'm, you know, from your mind and your experience. And, you know, just little signals like that, sincere, obviously, but I know that they will be. So then not only will she just continually be open but that should probably spread to other so if anybody else is needing anything and you say hey guys I need you to open up more a little bit and maybe Viri speaks up and goes yeah I did and it was awesome you know yeah super excited about this you're awesome good job good job good job and you just got right on it I love that and I love that you're all stealthy like I'm gonna talk to Viri but I don't want her to feel worried so I'm gonna talk to everybody well yeah I think you know the other interviews were good in their own rights for different reasons but Viri was the principal target yeah yeah but but you put in the effort to go through the whole thing first of all to consider and to not want to make her afraid and so to take time to talk to everybody which obviously is a benefit and wisdom anyway but that's the difference between bosses and leaders Lorenz and you just do it it because you're like, well, of course, duh, like, what else am I going to do? But, but I want you to understand that is not how most people operate. And it, it's what makes you really great and why people feel safe is because you default to that into caring and concerning about people. And they're like, what is this? That's not, that's not how people normally are. So good job.
00:18:24 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
job. Thank you. Thank you.
00:18:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Making me blush a little bit. Well, I am sincere.
00:18:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I promise you.
00:18:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good job. Okay. So did we learn anything? Did she share anything with you that that we can use?
00:18:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Did you have any coaching points? Let's get into the nitty-gritty of everyone. Yeah. So I guess that's where I'm very, let's talk about her. Okay. So generally, she's very happy. She's, she's, I think she was, she, she explained to me that, Initially, she was a little bit, she didn't know how to fit into the sweet lawyer's system because she came from a place where all the jobs were very segregated. so she would only do one type of task. Whereas here, it's kind of like all hands on deck. She likes that she's finding her way through that and that she's getting to a point where she's able to feel helpful, especially at the end of the mountain, things like that. And she likes that she's growing a lot faster than she expected.
00:19:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's living a lot quicker than she expected. I love that.
00:19:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
One of the stress points right now is she wishes she had more time. She asked her, do you feel like you have too many cases that you're too many tasks for the cases that you and John had. And she says, not necessarily, I just wish that there is a way for me to come in earlier in the morning. So like once we get, I can get some of those tasks done before we get phone calls raining in. And she said, well, I might look into some daycare for my kids, my younger kids that don't have school so that I can come in earlier and told her, know, she needs to stay later, that's fine too, know, she doesn't have to work around her schedule within reason. And then we talked, but I do think like it's also, this might be a product of, well, she's still fairly new, she's still learning quite a few new tasks. And I think some things will get quicker as she gets more experience with them. I'm also thinking about talking to John about making sure he doesn't all flow too much to her. Then, you know, we had a conversation a little hard to hard about, you know, like this is not a place where she needs to be on guard all the time, she can make mistakes and we'll work on them to get others, this is a safe place to be, know, she doesn't need to look for perfection. And we set some goals, I told her, you know, she had a hard time setting goals, and so we kind of looked at certain things together. I looked at the cases from her and John and they have, there's too many cases in collecting meds right now, collecting med status. So I asked her what would be a good goal for, to move cases from collecting meds to ready for demand and she set a goal for it to do 20 cases by next month. I think it's a little bit ambitious, I'm honest, but I don't want to, she wants to do 20, I'm not going to like tell her it's too, too many. Right.
00:22:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So elaborate on that for a little bit, did you say collecting meds to ready for demands?
00:22:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:22:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And like meds being like medical like reports and doctors and medical records and billing. Medical records and billing.
00:22:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. Kind of the biggest bottleneck in my case.
00:22:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Now. And her goal was to do what? To get 20.
00:23:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
In what time period 30 days, so we said goals for 30 days. I think 20 I say she gets to between 10 and 15.
00:23:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that would be very impressive. Where is she out right now?
00:23:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I don't have any prior data, but I know on average that's about how much people are able to get because there's so many things outside of your control zone. If the hospital says we'll get to it when we get to it, apart from following up every other day, there's not much you can do to hurry that along.
00:23:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm wondering, so I talked to you in Samantha that one time and we talked a little bit about tracking time and she was definitely not interested in it and everybody operates differently. That's okay. This isn't that. picking lots of other things. But what I will tell you, is I haven't even marked it this exercise, although he pushed off on it for a long time first. But imagine that our time is, so imagine we're a store, and the store operates, and it has a certain amount of stuff that it can sell and make money with, right? There's this fixed, that's your inventory. Well, your business is the tasks that you do. It's rather than items on a shelf. It's the supply is your time, and the things that have to get done. And you have a certain amount of hours to work with. And that's it. So by tracking time, if we were to track everybody's time for a couple of weeks, this has nothing to do with micromanagement. This has to do with finding out what Legos are in the back. That's all it is. It's understanding where things are. are going, how long it takes, and looking at it and zooming out and going. I wonder what would happen if we changed the order of operations. I wonder what would happen if we changed who's doing what or when, but until we don't even know what questions to ask about how we can do it better, until we break down how everybody is spending their time. And if they're not afraid to share it, if they're not afraid to really track it. So for example, you've got Mike, Mike, we know Mike is late, we know Mike takes longer breaks, but we also know that Mike is bomb at getting just distributions, and that he likes doing it, and it doesn't stress him out. And so, you know, imagine everybody's a stick, and on one end there's a poopy side, and on one side there's gold, and you have the gold. but the only way to get the gold is to pick up the poop, like that's how people are. We've got the good, we've got the bad, you get both. You can't separate them, you can't cherry pick what's good about people and refuse to accept what's bad at them. most of the time, our strengths are actually the same things as our weaknesses apply differently. So for example, I'm very bold. I will say what's on my mind, I will step up and get things done, I will just do it. I have this like bull energy and it makes amazing progress. And my brain is powerful and I'm able to think about so many different things and so I can run several different things and several different projects faster and better than the average person is. But that's the strength part of it. When I talk, my brain goes ding, ding, ding, all over the place and people who are not like ADHD cannot follow it and it annoys them and it frustrates them and stresses them out. And when somebody repeats themselves even once, like I heard you the first time, I understood you the first time, you are annoying my brain when you repeat yourself. So now I'm annoyed and that's frustrating them because they're like, well, I need to process things this way. And so to them, it's a perceived weakness. Also, the strength of my energy, some people find incredibly intimidating when it's directed at them, even though it's not directed at them, right? It's just the conversation that we're having. So they hate it when it's pointed at them, but they love it when it's pointed at anybody else on their behalf. But they want to make me wrong for when it's pointed at them. And I'm right and wonderful when it's pointed at anybody else for them. Now, I'm not being any different. I'm being me the same all the time. they're deciding if it's right or wrong or good or bad and they don't get to. Does that make sense? So, you know, Mike, his nonchalance is what makes him so good at distributions because he doesn't care. He does, he does the job, he does it well, but he doesn't care what people think about it. That is exactly the same reason he can roll in late and take long lunches because either you're going to take it or leave it, but I'm going to do what I'm going to do. They are exactly the same qualities. One has a positive effect that we really enjoy. One could be considered non-professional and annoying, but you don't get to pick and choose how it shows up or you do, but if you get rid of him because you don't like how it shows up in his time behavior. here, then you lose the power of how it shows up in this conversation with clients. You pick up under the sticks, you either take the stick or you don't, but you get both sides.
00:29:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:29:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we need to know what's on the stick. And we need to know what it's doing every day. And we need to know, so let's say I don't know, like, what are the things that everyone's good at? is there something if we do some time tracking, and we say, this person and this person both have, you know, similar tasks to do, but this person does this type of task super fast, like we're looking at it and they spend two hours a week doing it.
00:29:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
this person spends 10 hours a week doing it. Not me. I mean, I remember last year when we discussed it, I initially was kind of on board with it, and I presented it to the team. Usually the team is like, you know, whoever Lauren says, we'll do it, know, they're pretty well liked.
00:30:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
likes this task.
00:30:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
But this was like unanimously rejected, all hated it.
00:30:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I think it's because of fear because nobody wants the microscope on them. That is the thing that most people, when I get into teams, they're afraid of it. They're afraid of being inspected closely. But if we can help them understand, it isn't about them and it isn't about looking for flaws. It's about looking for levers, opportunities to find the sunspots and what's different.
00:30:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
it's in take.
00:30:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:30:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I believe my audible, but I might have read it like a few years ago.
00:31:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do. I would like you to read it. So there's one story where there, I don't remember where it was. I feel like it was an Asian, like an impoverished Asian population, where basically everybody was suffering from malnourishment. And but they found this one area, this one village, where the children were thriving. And they're like, and so, okay, so this, this group of people, I'm probably gonna butcher this because it has been like 10 years since I've read the book. But they were tasked with going to helping improve nutrition for an area. They had like six months and almost no money basically. They had like no way to overhaul nutrition because there was not enough money and not enough time. But when they did, down there and they dumped at the Legos basically and they looked at everything and they like what is different. So every single population they were malnourished the children were skinny they were sick they were weak except for this one village and the difference was that the mothers so they while they were working and they started adding the shrimp into the rice and that extra protein and nourishment completely changed the way that they they were they were healthy they were strong they were thriving so that was available to all of the rest of the communities they didn't have to re-educate them they didn't have to get a program going they didn't have to bring new food in they didn't have to change changed the food chain supply at all. It already existed. They just needed to change the way that they behaved, which is utilizing a resource that was already existing and adding it to their meals.
00:33:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, you know, I'm a, you know, my background, I did a psychology in college, but not like, my whole thing was numbers and statistics.
00:33:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
loved it.
00:33:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, yeah. So, I understand the value of the proposition, but I'm wondering if there's an alternative way to get the same results with that.
00:33:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's what I'm going to tell you. I don't. I'm not a fan of interrupting, but I'm going to because this is the leadership job. Sometimes you need to convince people that they need to do the hard thing. Your job is to motivate the troops and say, we need this data. so that you can enjoy your job better. There is something here, like go read that book, go get the study, go see if you can find a parallel study so that you have enough ammunition to explain to them. I have no interest in micromanaging you. I have no interest in picking apart how you're spending your time other than going, is there a way we can build a better mouse trap? How can I help you, like what are the things that you could, do I need to train you better? Maybe I can take something off your plate and shift it to somebody else who enjoys it more and does really well and give you more of what you like. I don't know, but until we break everything down and take inventory, we don't actually know exactly what we're working with. And I want you to care enough about your career. And I want you to have enough trust in me as a leader to say that if we gather this data together, we can look getting go huh what we're doing the best we can okay great job but I've never gone through this exercise with any company over 22 years in any industry where we didn't go whoa I didn't know that what if and then we make a slight alteration and there's improvement but what is requisite first is a willingness to get the information now either these are people who are willing to be a little bit vulnerable and invest in tracking this time or they're not but so let me give you one more motivator that you may not want to use but you can and you should you're spending extra time once a week meeting with me trying to figure out how you can be better for them you take out out of your own pocket your incentive pay to give to the team. You're investing in leadership and improvement. The least that they could do is track their time for two weeks. Because you want to know, look, are you here to collect a paycheck or are you here to be part of a team and be the best part of the team that you could be? If you're here to collect a paycheck, you're probably not going to last a long time. Because you're going to be at this for a couple more decades probably before you retire, right?
00:36:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh yeah, the fire retire.
00:36:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Right. This world is not getting cheaper. So don't you think you have the best odds of being successful at it and being like minimizing stress and actually enjoying your life and enjoying your job if you're surrounded by people who are invested and being the best that they can be like you are?
00:36:56 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I feel like I am right now. I think all four of them are pretty invested in what they're doing, which is why I appreciate them so much.
00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Two weeks of time tracking, like what's their biggest issue?
00:37:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
know this is like, I know you're probably going to say no, but Can I just ask them, okay, you don't need to give me your exact times, but you need to give me a percentage for each task, the percentage of the total time for that day for each task.
00:37:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me tell you why that doesn't work. They will guess if they're not writing down the times.
00:37:45 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, in other words, they would write down the time, but not having to share with me the exacts.
00:37:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Why? Okay, are they not getting paid hourly? Yeah, okay. Is there any reason why it's unreasonable to be held accountable for where your time goes when you're getting paid hourly. But the motive, that's the thing. That's your job as a leader to help them to believe and understand. you could tell them, look, I'm, if I wanted to be a jerk about it, my rights to say, look, you're paid hourly. This, this is, you know, a time report. Um, you know, I say do it, do it. But that's not why we're doing it. This is short term. This isn't going to be something that keeps coming up. It's not about micromanaging because it's not necessary. Micromanaging is counterproductive because you want autonomous people who are going to problem solves themselves. you need to tell them that also. Okay. But what this is, is a leadership effort on your part to figure out what. the pieces are and is there any kind of, okay, so for example, vieri came from a place where the tasks were segmented? Is the way that we're doing it better? How do we know? Let's take a look at what's happening and how it's going and how everybody on the team is performing and just see if we can do something like, do you guys not care enough to be willing just for two weeks, track your time? You can track your time too and you can report it and you can say, hey, I'll report to you, I don't have to, but I'm going to. Lead by example, if you want to, there's all kinds of ways to go about it, but at the end of the day, the more information that we have, the better we can lead and support and encourage and ask them to, like, are you going to be here for a year? Are you going to be here five years, 10 years, 15, 20 years? Do you want to be in an environment that is optimized for you to be able to spend your time doing the things that you enjoy the most or that you're the best at? and being surrounded by people who are being able to. I don't know, like do you wanna, how much joy do you wanna have out of it? Do you wanna come in and just drudge through it? Because what we're doing today, we don't get to keep doing. Like if you're not, we're always moving, we're either moving forward or moving backwards. There is no static, there is no being stagnant. And the market keeps changing. And there will be somebody better coming up. Like if you want to create the environment where you don't have to keep going and looking for another job and new people to work with, then we have to make the most out of what we have here. But in order to do that, we need to analyze it. And we need to not be afraid of analyzing it, which means they need to trust you that you're not there to pick things apart and break it, but you're there to look at it and go, how can we make it better? how can I support you? And either they believe you or they do. don't and either they're willing to do the extra work or they're not. They can grab about it. They don't have to love it. Nobody has to love it. And I would encourage that you don't grab about it because that doesn't support anything and that's negative and it perpetuates negative energy. You can complain once. can say, I don't like it once, once. Other than that, you become a complainer and that's an issue and the culture should be, because we talked about culture last week, we're not here to be a complainer. We're here to make the best out if we can. So that's it. It's a long conversation sometimes. It's a short conversation, but it's your job as a leader to try it now. Now, you don't believe in it, sorry my dogs are going nuts, then that's a whole other issue. So let's start there. Do you think that there's value in understanding how long it takes people to do tasks and how long they spend on it and seeing if there's any kind of patterns that evolve? okay data is my safety blanket right you like you just said like that's what you were looking at was numbers so this should make perfect sense to you so i need you to dig deep and explain to them why you love numbers and to me this is what i tell people all the time numbers tell the truth numbers don't have emotions right so if i go and i look and and very takes um 10 hours a week or 15 hours a week for for just collecting medical records and she's only getting five cases and i don't remember the other person who's equivalent on your team i have to go look at the numbers the spreadsheet hold on mike that would be mike right well they don't work out that way or maybe they did anyway it's not a perfect analog because it's a little bit differently on the other team but right so but anyway comparing what you can and going you know this takes you a lot longer but but for example it's Is there anything that Mike can do to help Viri or I don't know who else would would be doing distributions but can Mike teach anybody any that or is that just his innate qualities and it's not teachable there's probably a tactic that he could share right now and I'm all for cross training um do you have any problem with me saying telling them you know this time keep this time keeping data is just between you me and Tina not a thing not at all and you can tell them my origin how we came to work together um the impact that it had on you last year that mark has been hiring me for over three years now um that he has done this work he's done the time tracking and the time reporting so um you know uh Yeah, I think that that is helpful and to know that, you know, some of the surveys that they've seen in Sweet Law, some of the things that have your team is newer, but that we're constantly looking for supporting and making the best place for the existing people, rather than going, who can we fire? Who can we get rid of? There's never that energy here.
00:44:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I can sell it better like that because it, you know, it doesn't matter how nice Mark and Mary are. There's that upper management where they feel like they have to be a little bit more guarded.
00:44:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you can tell them, Mark's done going to see it, Mark doesn't want to see it. He doesn't even know I'm asking before it. Like that's the autonomy that I have and the autonomy that you have, which in and of itself is part of the culture autonomy and you're not trying to undo it and you wouldn't because micromanagement is a nightmare. It is a just stress cesspool. It's not good for anybody. It feels terrible. This is just data. This is just data. It's data that scares them and you get that because it feels like a microscope. But the intent of the microscope is to go, what can we make better for you, not what's wrong with you?
00:45:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. Yeah, I think I can sell that.
00:45:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The framing is everything and maybe you can tie a reward into it saying like the more accurate the data is after two weeks, like this is what I'm willing to put into it. Maybe you give them, I don't know if it's a financial incentive or maybe just, I don't know. I don't know how to do that. I don't know what motivates your people. But if you could then by sending it incentivize them, or just even show thanks, you know, whatever you have to do, but I can tell you that data is super helpful. There's always an aha moment where we can go, oh, this might be how we can support them better. For example, so one of the surveys that we did was Sweet Law. Black Swan, Black Swan, you know who Black Swan is, right? Yeah. Okay. That came as a result of a survey. That came as a result of me saying, how can we help your people more? Where are they struggling? And one of the answers was converting leads to cases. So it wasn't just intake, but it was also, you know, the attorney team. And it was primarily intake being better at sales, but it also can happen from, you know, getting fired up of cases. And there's this whole persuasion tactic. So But it was a long time going through, just trying to get people to read the book from Black Swan first, and then trying to get the appointment and get the training, like you don't know how many times, every single week, I'm like, where are you at with Black Swan? Well, blah blah blah. Like it just took so long, but as a result of it, Samantha, for example, just reading the book automatically improved, she took some concept from it. She had an aha moment, and from that point forward, applied it and improved her numbers rapidly. I wish I could remember what it was, but I don't know what the tactic was because I didn't read the book anyway. But that's my point, is that we didn't know until we did the survey and asked questions, and somebody was willing to be honest and say, I could be better at sales, and so we got that. And you can share that. There was another, the intake also, at least one person, but I think that there were a couple of people that said, I don't know how to talk to people whose child died or whose spouse died in an accident. Like, this is really difficult. And so we got the grief counselor to come in and talk to them. Did you know that?
00:48:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, but I wish I would have been there because that's like one of the things that I struggle with too was when I because in Arizona, the attorney has to talk to the to the client before they sign. And usually, like, I get a little nervous every time I have to talk to a debt, wrongful death case.
00:48:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, we could, I could get Mark to bring them back in. And also, there are people who didn't get that. So because they're new since then.
00:48:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You know, I do OK. Like, I don't like avoid it if I'm the only one available.
00:48:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But do you want to do OK? do you want to get some extra skills that can help you be even better at it?
00:49:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'm always for extra skills.
00:49:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, and that's the thing I want you to take from this is that these things are happening in Sweet Law, but it starts with asking questions, it starts with honest vulnerable answers, then it goes with taking action and trying to improve that situation, but none of it did anybody get, you know, laser pointed, hey, you're coming out of here. It has all been beneficial to the members of Sweet Law.
00:49:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, with the month I'm having right now, I don't know. Oh, we're having a pretty crappy month right now, so.
00:49:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, we've got a little bit more time. What is there anything that you feel like you have control over that you can improve that?
00:49:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
There's sticks in the fire, and I know they're going to come, but right now, I mean, it's bad. It's like my worst month so far.
00:50:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So we've been digging into your team. I would like to spend some time working with you and working with your processes. I'm sure that we can do something to improve it. But you are, your team is you. Like these are your resources. So I need you to be successful at persuading them. We need this information. I need to know what your resources are and you need to know what your resources are. Because being able to lean on mic for distributions had to have been really eating to you.
00:50:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, yeah, extremely.
00:50:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So is there other relief that can come for you and for others that we don't know about because we haven't fully inspected. So here's the thing is if Lorenz's pod goes down, guess what happens Like, if you don't hit your numbers and you don't have a job, guess what happens to everybody else?
00:51:05 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
They don't have job.
00:51:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, so help me help you, right? Jerry Maguire, then. Tell me the money. Tell me the money. So, look, and we're at the beginning of this, and I need you to just take a deep breath and be like, I am on the path of growth, and I'm willing to do the work. Now, if you see that you could hustle your way to something different, if you could see where you can make some improvements, what, so other than what we've already talked about, I want you to do that. want you to get your team on board with time tracking for two weeks, incentivize them, however you can, but you can be vulnerable to and say, like, this is the worst month I've ever had since I've been here. If I'm out, you're out. And this is not your fault. So, I'm trying to figure out how do I make everybody be as great as possible. possible so that we not only just have jobs but we have jobs we'd like that we want to stay with working with people we like um that's your job that's what you need to do you need to lead them you need to make them trust you because you are trustworthy anyway and you are safe and do that and then I need you to start digging into your processes I need you to track your time Lorenz that would be very helpful to me um I may need to ask Mark about that and say hey can you help me look at this you'll be safe with him just just your time and but I'm asking you at a time if you're okay with that um if you track your time for two weeks and say hey what do you notice about this could you make it better he likes you he knows that you are reliable he you you are wanted you are wanted so he wants you to be good you want to be good the business needs to be good. You'll get paid more if you do better. I need you to trust that you're safe with him as very as with you because you are.
00:53:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, he's pretty inscrutable when that comes to me.
00:53:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I get a different perspective and I need you to be able to trust me. I know both sides. I've seen glimpses of it and but I know the game. I know the locker room talk and I know the person and you're as safe with him as very as with you. So but I want you to buckle down. want you to roll up your sleeves. I want you to be vulnerable and I want you to get the work. So start tracking your time very closely. Let me analyze it first. If I can find an not on my own. We can just keep it between us. So that will mean that I need you to be super informative about all these things. So when you track your time, I want you to explain it to me too, because I don't know all the lingo. I don't know all the operations. I don't know a lot, I don't know all of it. So I want you to be really thorough and explain this is this, this is this, this is why this is important. This is what's hard about this. This is what this means to the value of the case. Like, I want you to analyze it as much as you can before you even give it to me.
00:54:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So you don't want just the Y as well?
00:54:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The Y, the how, the way you prioritize it, what logic you use to prioritize it. I want to understand everything I possibly can understand about it. Because the way my brain works, I should be able to help. And if I can't and we need to get It's what I need insight from market that we can, but the more information you give me, the less likely I'm going to ask or need to ask anything because Lorenz, this is what I do most is optimized. So that data is really important to me. So if you can do a good job of tracking it accurately, timestamps as often as possible, and then really explain it, I can just about guarantee you I can find something to improve you. But now I want to go back and just give you one more reminder that we had one conversation you thought differently about how to make leaders around you and you up to numbers immediately that very next month. So we are going through and we're looking for leverage and we're having way more than one conversation and I don't ever fail because when people will do the work and we get the data, there's always a very simple path to improvement even if it's small and then what happens is those small improvements start to compound. So there's really not anything to be afraid of because statistically I don't feel and the people I work with don't fail if they show up and they get the data and they do the work. It hasn't happened yet. Not saying it can't. I'm just saying that there's always a place to improve a little bit and that little bit of improvement having the compounding effect and now you're multiplying it times everybody else having a little bit of improvement and now your whole team is improving month after month, after year, like that's powerful. Those numbers start to become very obviously much better but what happens in addition to it and this is my favorite part is there's less stress while it's happening because now people understand the mechanics where they weren't even considering the mechanics before. They're like I still have to work and I do what I do. Instead of a stroke to work, I do what I do, but why do I do what I do and why do I do it this way and when they analyze it and then they optimize it, that's a whole new ball game. And so think about when you're driving and you're learning how to drive. There's a lot. And the first time that you get behind the wheel so imagine being a kid being like that's so easy. All you have to do is like press the gas and go room room and turn the wheel my kids every single time until they drive and then they drive it like oh my gosh it's so scary. Yeah, because you're having to make multiple calculations instantaneously on the fly they're so much going through your brain and you're having to evaluate every single thing. Is it my turn to go do I put a signal on do I break it my breaking too much. That guy's going is it my turn and like wait, wait, there's all these different things. Okay, and you're having to process them. And so in the beginning. you're having to make these calculations and they're new, so you're just asking yourself, what are the numbers that even going into the calculations? But eventually, you drive so much that they become reflexive. You automatically know, like, imagine what it was like when you were learning your times tables. At first, you have to sit there and like, it all down and figure it out and find some way to do it. And then you memorize it. And then you know, 4 times 4 is 16. 6 times 6 is 36. Like, you just know what they are. So you don't have to spend time on it, which means it's less stressful because it's reflexive now. Driving is no longer stressful because it's reflexive now. Math is not basic, right? There's a lot of things that become less stressful because they're reflexive because what you did was stop having to make the calculations. So But if you can create the system that removes the need to make the calculations and the calculations are needed because I'm stressed out and how do I figure out how to get through these things when the phone starts ringing all day? Well, I need to come in two hours early, but now I have to go take my two kids who are not even in school yet and get daycare. So I'm going to disrupt their time and it's going to be early and I'm going to spend extra money just so I can do the job that should be able to be contained in the work hours.
00:59:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Right.
00:59:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. That's stressful. What if we could get enough information and the only thing that came out of it is Viri is meeting her goals and now she doesn't have to go disrupt the lives of her young children by getting a daycare provider and now somebody, does she trust them? Are they safe? Are they happy? Do they feel loved? Is she stressed out the rest of the time? I'm now because she's leaving her little kids and they're only going to be little for a few more years before they start school. Like, that's a big deal in a person's life. But with a little bit more information, we might be able to figure out how to optimize what we're doing so that her children aren't so that her performance is still good throughout the day because she's not depressed that she had to lead them two hours earlier just to get the job done. Because we're not segmented and segregated here like in other businesses and maybe I should just go back to another firm where at least I only have one type of task and I didn't have to leave my kids. Like, people don't think about all these things in their teammates. Sometimes the bosses aren't thinking about them, but your people are thinking about them and sometimes they just make a decision and then they up and lead. So you need to think about it all proactively. And in order to be able to think about it well, you need eat data and information. So you can use that as an example. If you talk to Viri first and say, can I use this as an example? And maybe you don't use her specifically, maybe find a way around it and draw a similar kind of story that doesn't draw too much attention to her. But at the end of the day, greatness is always hard work. Average is, it's not fun, it's stressful. The average job is people don't want to go. They go because they have to. Because they have to pay bills. That's the average workplace. Showing out to a place that you like to work, even if it's remote and existing with an organization that you like and that you feel safe with, that's not average, that's above average. That's great. But to keep, to get even better, like it takes more or effort. So you have to decide what you want and then you have to decide who you want with you and then you have to decide if you can motivate them to be great with you because it would be so much more enjoyable than just being worried about your job every day or every week or every month.
01:02:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. I'll start trying my time tomorrow then.
01:02:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right.
01:02:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Hopefully I can be, you know, can have like first-hand experience and then I'll be able to sell them all that even stronger.
01:02:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that and we can wait so that you have some example and then you know if you want to wait a couple weeks before you ask them, track your time.
01:02:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
and I could only make sense for me to jump into the frame, know, before them.
01:02:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. I love that. I love leading by example. And then if we find something, a nugget that we can work on to improve for you, you can say, look, this was my experience. I did it, and I know exactly what I can do to make some improvements, and I feel better about it. I feel more peaceful about it. I feel clearer about it. that's everything. You know, you testify yourself, I know that this is going to be good for us, and I'm only looking for the good.
01:03:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
01:03:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. You can do this. And the goal, the goal is that it's to, it's to feel great, it's to enjoy the people that you're working with, the work that you're doing. We're not going to enjoy all of it. There's going to be stuff that sucks. That's just life. But you can create packets of just, wow, that's great. These people are great. This is awesome. And it's okay that I have to do this. for the next 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 years, whatever it is.
01:04:04 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, yeah, I want them to know what it's like to feel like you're working every day for someone else's dream. I want to feel like they're working towards their own dreams to they're invested in them.
01:04:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, the growth of business as much as they are on their own. Yes. And that's a good thing to also what we didn't get to what I would love for you to do is send me what everybody's goals where you said you wanted goals for each of the people about time. my job was waiting for me to take her shopping so she can get ready for girls camp. I'm fine. I'm excited about that. But please send me that just so I have it. And any other notes that you might have just clip notes on how those meetings went. And then so next week, I'm meeting just with Patrick. And then the week after that, we'll have our group meeting and then the week after that is our one on one. So we'll figure it out. out. But if you send that to me an email, then maybe we can just kind of work this in the background. But the very least, that gives you those two weeks to be tracking your time. And I want you to analyze it. want you to look at it and go, huh, maybe, you know, just see if you noticed any kind of patterns.
01:05:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Sure. Yeah.
01:05:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Thanks, Tina. You're awesome. Thank you for your time, Lawrence. I hope you have a great week.

The one that has I don't have it, so I'm still using my Mac, so which and if I told you this I have arthritis and I can feel it now.

00:03:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, did Mark decide if he's coming or not?
00:03:06 - Chona Sweet

00:03:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You tell me what you want. So let's go back over the homework quick.
00:03:20 - Chona Sweet
So map out, ideal, work read. Okay. So I can also copy his comments into my notes, which I was actually, yeah, when you're done. No, I was thinking about it and I don't know why it's having difficulty answering that question. I don't know why. I feel like because your question is now and the future. Yeah, I don't know why it, I'm having difficulty answering that. question. That's, that's something to look into.
00:04:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tell me just work through it.
00:04:13 - Chona Sweet
Talk, talk to me about it. So I think right now, I mean, maybe because of the, um, uncertainty of all of these, like, I honestly do not know how I, I assume that I will have to work a lot. That's what's in my head. That's why it's hard for me to even schedule something for, to work on my physical health and maybe, you know, schedule a workout.
00:04:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel that's actually the reason for the exercise. So we reverse engineer it is what we do. Now there are going to be seasons where you're definitely Going to be putting in a lot more time. You're in one of those seasons right now starting as always the hardest part right, but there is There's not really any such thing as work-life balance right where everything's always everything is good all the time That doesn't work but it's more like Changing harmony like if you ever seeing and you're seeing in music the notes are changing constantly and Sometimes they're in harmony with each other. Sometimes there's dissonance and all of it's beautiful and and it's orchestrated on purpose, so What what we want to do is figure out So this is a conversation about principles and priorities and values right and from that so Principles and priorities inform What we're going to do and why we're going to do it and well okay so principles inform priority right what's important to us our values inform what's important to us what's important to us is priority right and priority informs activity what are we going to do it should it doesn't always most times people are on autopilot or they're doing they're reactive and they're doing what they're told to do or what they think they ought to do rather than what is actually most important to them so by having this conversation early on we get to the point sooner rather than later where you can do the things that you need to do because whatever you do if you're burning yourself out it's not maintainable right hey Mark sorry I just caught the last part about trying to burn yourself out on purpose now yeah tell me something I don't know mr. sweet let's go faster let's go Oh, master. Oh, my gosh. Tona, do you know how many times if I could have, like, reached through the... Yeah, who many times?
00:07:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm really basis for her as well with me, so I have to I'm telling me shocked.
00:07:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, we can shift gears, Tona. We can go back to that because I'd rather use Mark's brain for two things. So what you brought up is just...
00:07:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm suddenly you drugged up at the moment, so just as an FYI.
00:07:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

00:07:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. My little girl went to school for the first time in a week. They've got COVID. It's been going around yesterday. I almost want to cry just thinking about it, but I got her up, and I'm like, are you going to go to school? She goes like... I need to like yeah, you do and so I go out and she gets dressed and she's to the door and she's got her backpack on She's being a good girl, I look at her and she got tears down her eyes, and I'm like going back to bed You were not going to school Okay, I feel better now. Okay, wait, no actually she thinks that's distracting me I was trying to pay attention to what you wanted. Okay, so When you're talking about she has a first shot at first one shot at first impression. Yes What is good ice? Oh, look how cute.
00:08:30 - Chona Sweet
Shona is China you so I'm telling he's You're cute.
00:08:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're adorable.
00:08:39 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You're beautiful Cool sandwich place in New York City Tell it's based in Tuscany, I guess like all on Tonshio sandwiches So they make the bread fresh every five minutes and so it's really thin You guys get all this good food.
00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I live in redneckville, okay, and they're And when I get to go visit my sweetheart, I'm like this Let's have like just feed me. I'm I'm happy. Okay. So, okay, so the automation and follow up. Sorry, is a conversation we were having. But the fact that you brought up first impressions, make me wonder if there's an issue that's happening. Okay, so let's talk about that.
00:09:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So, because we can never time things perfectly, because you know, like, there was a patient that came to see Chona that was involved in a car collision. And it's not like a big enough case that I would get super excited about. mean, I would probably take it all things considered. So this was a really good way to for her to introduce herself to some other law firms, right, one of which ways to introduce yourself to a law firm. Hey, I have a potential case for you. And depending on how she had the relationship start, depends on how you would approach that, right? Yeah. And so the initial reaction was she had a law firm try to send them a case at one point and pull the case from Chris and Frank. And so I was like, okay, we'll meet that. the good one, but they weren't very responsive. So, I connected Chona to Mike Hobbes, who's a firm that I personally work with a lot. I like the guys a lot. very, very straightforward, but they're a very high volume firm. So their model is they get a lot of referrals from other attorneys and they also do a lot of their own marketing. This is not as we confuse with the Hobbes up north that Dan's worked with before, just FYI in case that comes up at all. They do about 300 cases a month. So, they do a pretty significant amount in just California. Okay. So, they're a high volume firms, but they're good guys, right? wouldn't connect to Chona if you didn't think we're good people. So, I don't know how the conversation went, I just said, hey, I'm introducing you, I called Mike, I told them about Chona about the practice that's going on, and one of the things that Mike said is, look, we're getting pushed back really, really heavily about doctors in our cases. So the doctors making a huge value difference on the personal injury side, which is something that I've you've heard me preach about, you know, 10,000 times. That's why the doctors are so important. So I go and spend time with them. That's why we keep trying to find new doctors because the personal injury course gets to be known as, you know, people who just do the same things again and again and become very well known and the insurance companies devalue them very heavily.
00:11:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you watching the football game?
00:11:27 - Chona Sweet
That's, I don't know how you can see the background on the school.
00:11:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What, that was sorry.
00:11:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's muted.
00:11:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's squirrel squirrel. Okay.
00:11:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Anyway, I thought it's wrong. And so that's one of things that I love with what Chona works with with Dr. E because he does so much insurance work. He barely does any personal injury in comparison. And so he's a very like clean doctor. And so even if gets to pose or whatever else, he can honestly say the vast majority of my work is insurance. This is what I built all this is when I do this is why it works. And it's great. And so for a firm like Mike Hobbuses, they're really excited because, hey, this is a new clean doctor that's like a secret weapon to someone. So now we've got three factors coming together. And I do this to kind of lay the groundwork, right? yeah, she was reaching out to them with, Hey, I've got this new client for you. So awesome. This doctor's already sending me clients. I told Mike, you know, I don't really want you on a sending me clients and not really want to send them clients because I think it could theoretically be a conflict, even though it's not. But just to not be conflicting.
00:12:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Avoid the appearance.
00:12:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Avoid the appearance of it. Reality and appearance are obviously two different things. But you know, these are people I trust and they're like, okay, that makes sense of why he's marketing me something really great if he doesn't have any interest, right? And it makes sense of why I'm doing it because I can't do it really for myself. Right. So here's Chona's introduction this afternoon to Mike Hobbuses, who could drive them, you know, 15 to a. hundred patients a month.
00:13:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, huge.
00:13:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
They're not ready for 50 to 100 patients a month, unfortunately, of new PI with how they're set up. But I can always pick and choose the timing of these things, right?
00:13:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, you can not do it preemptively, like too soon. You can do that.
00:13:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
an option for past that option.
00:13:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I just wanted to make sure that we are fully accountable across the board.
00:13:28 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
The other part of it, too, is I know Dr. E's, I mean, he's patient, but there's some lack of patients as well. Like, you know, been 45 days now and he probably would want to see some movement on the personal injury side.
00:13:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're faster, Mark.
00:13:42 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What does that sound like? Yeah, I know. Constantly faster. But also, this gives Chona a reason to say, hey, we need these things in place rather than just home.
00:13:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, sorry. dias are starting to hurt. Okay, focus, focus, focus.
00:14:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Her, I also saw this as a way for Chona to leverage this fact of, hey, I've got this new attorney's office who produces a lot of cases that's going to start sending us stuff that we need to get our together for lack of a better term, because Dr. E said the right things during our lunch of, hey, we'll make sure we have the proper email and proper things, but I kind of know how these guys go and like they'll say the right thing, but they get so distracted by shiny objects and, you know, else that's going on, and just quite frankly, his work period, that it's not top priority until it needs to be a higher priority. And so this is a way to push it to be a higher priority. Okay. That being said, in the short-term interim, so you were trying to push Dr.
00:14:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
E into making your work that you're doing a higher priority. I just want to make sure I'm on understanding this clearly.
00:14:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay, cool. And sorry, Chona's value and everything else. So that way, Dr. E gets a little more excited about building up the structure he needs to build out. Realize it's actually right there. Correct. And it's happening and not just theoretical and not . Yeah, got you. Um, so that's the reason for it. And I know that if something does go wrong on the first one or two, like these are guys I know well enough I can give them give Chona another chance in a couple months, but I obviously would prefer not to do that. So so when you talk about first impressions, you're more about like the whole operation, not like I'm talking about, unfortunately, you know, Chona's been told, okay, we've got this like info ad, you know, pain management or whatever it's called. We've got cast. We've got everything else like you telling Chona like, just do it yourself until you have a system that works because when you rely on other people, it's not their priority. It's a higher chance of it going wrong. And so it's building a temporary system until she can build a better system and a better thing around it.
00:15:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm with you, except you need to understand where she's at. She is in the oldest profession. That's not the oldest profession. Okay.
00:16:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:16:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:16:05 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That is definitely not the oldest profession. Why not? she's in that.
00:16:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a whole other thing we're going to talk about. Okay. One of the oldest professions ever. That is predominantly male. And this is, this is the reality though. There is an energy and a stigma and a literal psychological term. Ask Jonah that shows up and I'm trying to explain this in the way that you could understand because I know you and I know you're like whatever just do it. That kind of thing. But it's not that it's actually it's really not that easy. Of course it needs to be how I do things. Okay, but so there's there's two things that you have to deal with. Number one is the the actual issue of the structure and the mentality that she has to massage and work around. But the first step is China has to feel confident enough to do that. And that is being built up right now. That is new. So you remember how I talked about saying sweet things, Mark, and being encouraging. This is going to be one of those things where you actually have the most power to do that and just encourage her, again, a particular way. Because I can tell you as a woman who's come up, you know, six years in corporate and then in this business, there even when you're a very, very strong woman and born that way, there's, there's a lot that you have to fight mentally because you're kind of groomed to feel energy and then pull back when, when you resistance and kind of be like, okay, well, work around it, whatever. So the best way, and I'm telling both of you, the strategy to go around this is similar to the tactic that you just pulled, which is let me show you what's really on the table. So, and Chona, one of my favorite things that I learned is that it's better to make forgiveness than ask permission and just kind of do things. But, Mark, the stress and the energy that, so let's say she goes and she does everything perfectly. It's still going to stress the crap out of her. And she's going to take that energy and anxiety and it's going to need to have an outlet. You understand this? You've gone through so many things since we've been working together.
00:18:31 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know. She's in control of it and it's not up to someone else to drop the ball. For sure.
00:18:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Chona, who's being quiet right now and can participate in this conversation, you can do all of these things. But you guys will all get there faster. Just understanding the real, like, so you're not answering your phone first thing in the morning and checking the email and being reactive to everything that happened. She's barking at the dare. They play tag. Literally, they will just chase you. each other and the deer will stay there. And if the dogs go away, it'll stay there until it comes back and then they just wait down. Anyway, have a daddy. What was I saying? Sorry, it's only last during the talk. Dogs, but I really need to be out of time.
00:19:21 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, if I were in children's shoes, I would use this opportunity to leverage it. To talk to talk to me, to say, hey, I've got this potentially coming in. Let's try to make a system for right now of some of these new patients coming through because the one in our trip, it's like, yeah, I'm going to make these changes. going to set up this email that's proper. going to talk to Cheryl. I don't know if I'm to or did that not happen or you don't know.
00:19:49 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, so I'm not sure you want me to answer your question for you. want to talk about what we talk about. We have us or, you know, I don't know where you guys will just start right now.
00:19:59 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
we need to know what structure has been
00:20:00 - Chona Sweet
I haven't seen him the whole day. I just saw my patients because he texted me like 20 minutes before 9. He says, oh, you're taking over Long Beach patients today. And so I just get ready and it's 30 minutes away. So that's what happened this morning. But to answer your question, I haven't talked to him. He's gonna call me supposedly tonight. He's in the OR right now doing cases. So that's that. So I don't, I don't know if we have an email. Sorry.
00:20:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry.
00:20:40 - Chona Sweet
Go ahead. You're still talking. Right now, I spoke with one patient that's coming from Mark. Actually, I talked to her last month. So she's kind of all over the place. So finally, she agreed to come tomorrow. So that particular patient is coming from me because. through Mark. So they created a group chat for me, the office manager cast, which is part of, the office manager Cheryl cast, which is part of the lean and then me. So they open a new chat for me and then another person for me to put in there all the patients that's coming from me. Just a, not a formal medical records. It's more like, Hey, I have this new patient. Can you put it on the list tomorrow for me? That's, that's the, that's the only progress so far that I've seen that some sort of kind of segregation, like for me to say, this is for Chona from Chona, you think the chat for her. So that's actually a good thing because I, that's a start because I, I checked them today and I said, Hey, I want this patient to make a release. then the managers, like, we created a chat for you. I said, I'm not included. So and then he's like, okay, let me include you. So that's actually a win already. That's number one and then number two about Mike have us about this new patient that I I'm referring to them right, so I talked to Mike have us and I we talked briefly about the patient about my background Where we're at where offices at and he asked something that I really don't understand he asked something about who manages your lean or your the paper you guys have someone else just doing that so what I understood is he's third-party Person like choice and what I said is no, it's just us managing That's my answer and then he's like, okay, so that's that was a question.
00:22:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Let me explain to you exactly what he was asking They know exactly what he's asking. He's asking about billing Yeah, it's a lot of pain doctors and a lot of busier practices have either third parties or a biller handle it. And it's generally a huge source of frustration because those billers are paid on what percentage of the total bill they get. So they're incentivized to try to get as much from the lowers as possible. And on our side, lower side, it can get really frustrating because it just sometimes doesn't make sense. we'll make a very fair offer. And they try to squeeze out an extra hundred bucks or 200 bucks that just pisses off the attorney and takes acceptance. So yeah, so what you about was you being the main point of contact for billing for scheduling for everything else kind of in the short term. So you have control and how this feels good about it. And God forbid you ever leave Dr. E or go somewhere else. It's tied to you and not to someone else.
00:23:48 - Chona Sweet
So here's where my appreciation of all of this right now with with because I view and I told Mark about this and Mark gets, you know, easily appreciated with me. because I asked a lot of questions and I'm new. I have to reiterate that I'm really new at this field. And I don't know the dem, you know, all the abrogations, like anything like that. And sometimes I think Mark gets frustrated because, you know, Mark wants the things done, but he doesn't want to discuss the steps towards it or even diminution, like little things. I, like when I was asked that question, talking about first impression, I don't know if he got impressed with me or not because I, and he asked me questions about where do you do your MRI. It's a good thing I remember where I've been there for one and a half weeks, one and a half months. I remember this imaging place. I said, the wave imaging, I said, and then he said, that's actually a good place. it's a good thing that I even remember that. But then again, between Mark and Dr. E, I don't feel like I'm getting enough information, like. actually not support me, but it doesn't feel that way, if that, if I'm being honest.
00:25:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a lot to say, let's break all of these things down. First of all, just taking into account that there's a lot for you to wrap your head around. And Mark, so have I ever used the driving analogy and explain that to you what it's like, either one of you? Okay, so do you remember what it was like to learn how to drive? Yes. Learn how to drive.
00:25:29 - Chona Sweet
Actually, I was telling Mark I learned how to drive here in America.
00:25:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so here's, here's the point of that is that when you learn how to drive, first of all, my girls always think that it's so easy. They're like driving it so easy. I can't wait until I can do it. And then they get behind the wheel and they freak out because it's terrifying because what you have to process mentally, you have to know the law. But the law seems like it just goes out of your brain because now you're faced with, I'm at a forward intersection and I don't know if I go left or right. to drive stick. So I'm also trying to process the clutch and the gas and the break all at the same time while my mom's over here freaking out and I'm feeling her energy. And then I'm like, do I go? Do they go? And there's all of these thoughts and it is overwhelming and frustrating. And every single second in the car is stressful. But then a year later, you know, you've just been doing it. And one day you look around and you're like, this isn't that bad. It's not that stressful. And five years from now, you can eat and drink and have phone calls.
00:26:32 - Chona Sweet
You shouldn't do that. I'm just kidding. Nobody does that.
00:26:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, don't worry. I don't put on makeup or do any of that stuff, but I will eat and have a conversation. Oh my gosh. Anyway, there's the neighbor dogs. So the thing is, in the beginning, and for quite a while, you're mechanically processing everything. But there are gaps in knowledge. So when you're first learning how to drive, if you've never come into They have roundabouts now. They didn't that used to have roundabouts. some of the roundabouts have multiple lanes. And some of them don't. Every day, China is running into something brand new. Every day. And we don't know what we don't know. So sometimes she doesn't even know what questions to ask. But then if she has enough perception to say, I need to ask this question, but there's nobody to answer the question. Or nobody who can answer it from the perspective that she needs it, right? And that's different brains. It's a combination of different brains, and different personalities, as well as different values, which hold on to that word of values, because we need to come back to that with Dr. E. But you have to keep all of that in mind. Chona, this is why I'm telling you, like this is where you just have to buckle down and know it's going to suck for a while for all of these reasons. And you are going to deal with people who don't understand what it feels like for you to do what you do. And that is part of the path and part of the journey is not doing it because of how other people show up because of but because of what you want to come out of it. So if people aren't giving you what you want, then you have to decide, am I going to keep pushing until I get what I want? Am I going to drive this? Or are you going to let Mark drive it? And then you are just passenger and you're just kind of the leaf blowing in the wind. So I would recommend that you take a little bit more charge of it. If doing these things that way but for you to feel confident in it, you're going to have to drive and but taking into account that right now you don't know how to drive. You don't have the tools and you don't have the practice so it's important to keep that perspective and it's going to continue to be frustrating. Now there are things that we can do to speed up that process and smooth it out and one of the things is having a conversation with Dr. E between the two of you, I'd be Happy to join the conversation and help facilitate it, but it's really important to know what are his drivers, what are his motivators, what is his top priority. Because if his top priority is I'm on autopilot, I get through the day, I want more money, but I don't want to really put any effort into it. I don't want to do the structure. I don't want to make any changes. That's not really compatible. So then you got to hold them down and mark this to somewhere where you could be really useful be like, you say one thing, you do another. So like, these are the numbers that are available to you. Now, don't use my language. Use yours. This is me saying this is around the conversation, right? You have to figure it out. Now, did you just sell him into something he wasn't really interested in because you could?
00:29:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, no, no, no. Okay. Dr. E is a good doctor. He's a better business person. Okay. And he's been doing some personal injury before all of this. Personally, he's not brand new to him.
00:30:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if he's a good business person, why is he not understanding how to support this process better?
00:30:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He is drinking out of like four firehouses at the same time.
00:30:13 - Chona Sweet
Like Mark worse than me.
00:30:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's not necessarily a good business person.
00:30:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That's a busy business person. Very busy business person. Like we're talking about how he took over for Optum. Now he has 6,000 plus regular patients he needs to see and not enough staff to build on top of it. He's in the OOR right now. He is a practicing doctor while trying to also manage this business. And again, what he does on the insurance side or is the personal injury side are two almost contradictory practices. And so what I mean by that is he gets paid up at flat fee per month to take care of all these patients. He gets a little bit extra for, you know, each procedure he does. But he is almost incentivized to make it harder or more difficult for these patients. patients to come in, because he gets paid the same amount per month, whether he sees one patient or a hundred patients.
00:31:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That sounds very contradictive to what you're trying to do.
00:31:10 - Chona Sweet
So I don't want to cut Mark because we already established a key busy. I feel like he wanted someone to drive this, but here's my problem. I feel like I'm walking an eggshells, not with him, but with his office manager. So, you know, Cheryl. Cheryl wants to be involved with all of this. I don't know what kind of pay structure he did with her. I feel like he did also something else with PI with her, and he or he wants her to always be involved on the back end because he wants to take control on this PI cases.
00:31:49 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
But even another layer to it, he won't let her negotiate on the billing for PI.
00:31:54 - Chona Sweet
He wants to be in control of the money side of it. No, he does. She negotiates the PI too, but she gets frustrated. because the lawyers always, you know, negotiate down, so she doesn't like that, but she, she, I've talked to her multiple times because I wanted to be on her good side too. I wanted to understand how the practice works. She wanted help, but at the same time, I don't know if she's ready to let the rain go, you know. So, because when I asked her, if I have a new client that's coming from me, how does it work? And she once, and she, wants her to be emailed first. And that's what Mark and I are trying to avoid, is steer away from that, create a universal email where I am CC, where it will go to me, go to Cheryl, go to Cass, and go to E. But that's the email that Mark is talking about. Beyond that, it's the politics of me trying, I feel like I'm walking on eggshells with Cheryl, today. that I have a new patients for tomorrow, I already make a schedule and then they ask do you want me to call the patient schedule? No, I already did all that. Because again, I wanted to drive this, I wanted to make sure that I'm in charge on making sure there's appointments. again, that's where my frustration is at, other than no structure. But we are overwhelmed with the new patients coming in because of this optimization.
00:33:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And new patients, not PI patients, they're regular.
00:33:28 - Chona Sweet
PI, this is the regular patient of the clinic.
00:33:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so there's a lot of moving parts in there and personalities and roles. And that's what I was talking about too, having a conversation like understanding what drives and motivates Cheryl. Chona, I don't know that you were there for the conversation, but we were talking about how can she take stuff off of Cheryl's plate or how can she make it better because
00:34:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm sure, so like Mary, this is kind of, I don't know possible.
00:34:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cheryl's married. Right. So sometimes it's working around, sometimes it's working with, but first we have to identify what is the situation. I'm probably going to move in a minute.
00:34:15 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
She's driving me nuts. Go ahead. More than that. It's making sure Cheryl's still somewhat in the loop, whether we're working around her or not. If she feels like we're actively trying to cut her out. That's when there's going to be the biggest problem.
00:34:26 - Chona Sweet
Which I can talk to her again tomorrow. Every time I go see her, Cheryl talks a lot. I feel like I like her as a person. She's a dog person. I really like her. But her mouth and her mind are working really fast.
00:34:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry.
00:34:44 - Chona Sweet
Hold on.
00:34:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So do you know what she wants? Like what motivates her? What is she happy with anything in work? How long has she been told?
00:34:58 - Chona Sweet
old is she? Um, I would. Let's say she's, I don't know how old she is, but she's probably like early 50s, yeah, mid 50s. She has been with Dr. East since the beginning, which is, you're due to the 2017 honey, he's probably about the same or longer.
00:35:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
She's been around for a while, she's like theoretically quite like 10 times kind of situation.
00:35:24 - Chona Sweet
They have a very, they have a relationship like Mark and Mary. However, she is more vocal than Mary in terms of, and this is what I don't agree, but then again, Dr. E allowed that to happen, but she would call him out and call him, like when I say call him out, like they argue verbally, very, you know, other stuff and hear it, which again, that's their relationship. But, um, but her as a person, we talk and we actually gone into, you know, a deeper level. She, you know, it's just, she's just the kind of person. But I think she doesn't like more work for her, which she verbalized. And with this new up to 300,000 patients coming in, she's overwhelmed. So she's hiring new staff right now. Um, that's what's happening. So in terms of the PI, this is not her priority, if, to be honest.
00:36:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, that's important.
00:36:37 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, that's, that's where I come in. She really thinks that I will help her off low without taking it away from her. That's what it sounds like to me.
00:36:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is a very clear distinction. Um, so then you have a conversation about that. With her? Well, I think. I'm not really sure. This is this is one of those things that takes some finesse and maneuvering. So, and it works better with time, which is, he's not patient. Mark's not patient, so that doesn't work out very well. But Mark, so here's the reality. If you don't take time to finesse and massage it, either Chona is going to fail because that it's just not going to be worth it to her emotionally to do this, or Cheryl's going to leave, or like something is going to blow up.
00:37:38 - Chona Sweet
Right. Before we left, we added the lunch with Dr. E, and he said, he's going to talk to her about the clinic, but at the same time about the PI. Because he, Dr. E, he's supposed to hope. hire someone to be just in charge with P.I. calling the patients, creating that connection with the other lawyers or whatnot. So that is the plan, but the immediate plan is to create an email and phone number supposedly. Just for P.I. because I told him I'm going to attend in November, I'm going to attend this thing with Dr. Choy. That's a networking event. I need to be able to provide a card with the email and phone number that you want that someone will have to answer that phone. That's right now our phone system, our current patients are mad because they're calling no ones answering. They're leaving voicemails and the staff go to the voicemails whenever they can.
00:38:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I think one thing that might be really helpful and without creating a lot of friction is start with an org chart and roles and responsibilities. the P.I. structure isn't 100% knew he's done a little bit of P.I. right?
00:39:04 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Unfortunately, yes.
00:39:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Chona coming in and the arrangement that you have is really a new kind of beast and a new structure. So it might be good visually to outline an actual like org chart of what the structure looks like, maybe like a company within a company or whatever, however it looks like, but then roles and responsibilities so that there is a very clear visual without even talking to Cheryl about it. Coming to the table with this piece of paper that shows Chona is not a direct report to her that Chona is the head of her own little kind of department. Look, because otherwise you're going to have this battle.
00:39:51 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So You are in my spirit.
00:39:54 - Chona Sweet
I think you kind of know because we're contractors. knows that the way in her mind, because again, I've talked to for a long time, I feel, every time go talk to her is like three hours. But anyway, on her mind, she's in charge of the business side, part of it, the logistics of patient appointments and insurance, and also in charge with Medicare paperwork on the providers. The medical side is Dr. E, so that's how she's structured in her mind. So if there's a problem with patient care medications, it's Dr. E. But if there's a problem with, I guess, Medicare or whatever insurance signature we need to do, it's her.
00:40:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So within that, there's, what I'm talking about is delineating a difference between P.I. and any other patients. And thinking of that as almost like the silo inside of the business. So that, and within that realm, you manage the patients and the finances and the operations that now, Mark, you were making a face when I was talking about the org chart and all of that.
00:41:22 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So a little bit, because like, she's like a merit. And so in my experience dealing with have a thing.
00:41:30 - Chona Sweet
Anyway, what? No, I said that that's that. Unfortunately, like Dr. E, that's what Mark allowed to happen. Same with Dr. E, that's what he allowed for Cheryl to talk to him that way.
00:41:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't agree with it. Because because it's not delegation, what's the word when you you why can't I think of this word? It's driving me nuts, freaking hairy menopause didn't ever used to have this happen and now it's just like tip of the tongue. Anyway, um, an abdication, abdication. And Mark, you're good for that, by the way, abdication, an abdication, abdication, they've got it, whatever. Anyway, you're doing amazingly better now too, but this I think is a similar situation where it's like, out of sight, out of mind. I don't want to handle it. I'm going to, if I can yell at you and tell you to handle a certain amount of things and it comes within the realm of what I'm okay with, then that's all I'm going to do. And that's the situation. But the problem is you're trying to build an optimized structure within a chaotic structure that the two aren't very compatible. So either I mean, like, now if you were just putting a person into this, it's a whole not a business. You can burn through people. This is your wife. So Oh massaging it well and making sure that it's not like ruining her in the process is little bit different. But you have the ability to drive it and here's how you do it. The angle is always the numbers when you show people the numbers when you show them. This is what's on the table that we're not getting to, but also here's the cost of this structure not working properly. Here's the cost of you letting somebody be in charge who doesn't even understand the value of this and why it works this way and why it needs to work this way. This is what happens when you don't follow up with people and we're trying to build an engine that generates money. But it has to operate in a particular way because PI is different than everything else that you've been doing all of this type of stuff. But so if you can sit down with the data, whatever data you can have, it can be some forecasting and some projections and just say, look, this is this. This is what it would look like if we're operating a capacity, this is what the finances look like, this is how many patients we have, and then let me break down operations for you. Let me tell you how I imagine it would look like, right? One person has to be in charge of this. We have an automated follow-up system, it does this and this and this for scheduling. We've optimized charting, we've done all of these things, and then you really don't have anything to do with a doctor, except for you house it, and you hire Chona, and from time to time we have meetings in conversation, so we're all on the same page and making sure everything's flowing. Like that's how simple it is, however, it's only that simple if Chona is empowered to be able to build the structure that has to happen. So are you in or are you out? Like really, that's the conversation. Now, however you finesse that and negotiate that, that's up to you, but I'm telling you, the clearer you get, and the more data and vision. jewels you bring to the table. And I'll give you a reminder, every time we needed to get you on board to buy into something, it happened as a direct result of we got numbers.
00:45:11 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And then you're like, okay, and seeing it what are the issue that she was facing is if Cheryl thinks you're trying to go either directly around her or just not involving her in some way, shape or form. I don't know if she's going to go to the point of trying to sabotage. We're trying to make things just significantly more difficult.
00:45:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So hold on. So this is an if, right?
00:45:39 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And we can do if all day long. We don't know. Okay, with a relative degree of certainty that if we try to go around her cut her out, she will actively get significantly more.
00:45:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I agree with you. I agree with you. And what Chona is dealing with is alpha females type of thing. Like if you're the head girl in there, another woman coming in, it's almost most always, it does not work out very well. So, but, but Chona is not that type of person, but it doesn't matter, because it's their perception. That's all that matters. So, but this, this is why Cheryl needs to, I would have the conversation with Dr. E first, and then with Cheryl so that she could recognize this is a silo. This is a thing within a thing. So it's not about cutting you out. I'm taking nothing away from what already exists from you. And what I'm bringing in, you wouldn't have if I wasn't here. So, you don't need to worry about that. But here's what I'm going to do for you anyway, while I'm here. I would love to help you with some of your systems and some of your things and help improve your life. you can do that, Chona without taking too much on yourself. And I think that you can bring some improvement, but, but while you do it because your stuff is not her stuff, it doesn't matter if she adopts it or not, right? And it could just be being a friend, being nice letting her vent, like whatever kinds of things. But she needs to be able to physically see and wrap her head around how this doesn't exist and be very clear that it didn't exist without you. It's here because of you. You're not taking it from her. You're bringing something in new that has nothing to do with her, but exists in the same building for all intents and purposes. And either she can wrap her head around that or not. And then you guys have to deal with this and make a decision. Is this compatible? Are you willing to work under those circumstances? Or do you need to draw a line in the sand? And if so, draw the line. But either way, be very clear about what you are willing to do and not willing to do and don't put it in somebody else's power with their attitudes and whatever. Either figure out a way that's compatible or find somebody else to do this with.
00:47:55 - Chona Sweet
I thought, well, I talked to her. You talked to her, Marcus. me and I and her talk and you know that that is the the common thing that we're trying to say is you know how can we help you make it a little easier for you but bringing it in so like for example like the chat system that I start today again it's like saying hey this is coming you know it's kind of like me in a way telling them this is coming now and and so I think she is on board um she's overwhelmed with the new new optimizations but and I think Dr. E recognized the burden on her and that's why Dr. E said he will hire someone else it's more a full time because right now there's a part-time person doing the PI which is cast um which is related to Cheryl again it's very close to it but um I think we are there so it's just more of a rating I think right? Because we already talked to her about this. It's just more of really happening now. The main problem is someone who answers the phone. We need someone who- There's a lot of issues.
00:49:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, there's a lot. And you know, both Chona and are trying to figure out how to approach this in the way that gives her the highest chance of success, right? Because it's a lot of different factors and a lot of different factions. And his practice is obviously very, very different than what my stuff is to some level. Same time, it's also very similar to what I have to go through. And Dr. E recognizes that what they do currently is not going work for PI. Cheryl also recognizes that what they do is not going to be good for her period. So the good news is they both recognize that there is an issue. Neither one has a solution for the issue, but at least they recognize the issue. And so another part of the reason to kind of with light of fire under this, I guess, for lack of a better term is when people see that it's actually a fire that needs to be put out, then they tend to pay a little more attention to it and put some more resources behind it. So is that the most ideal way of doing things? No. But you and I both know, like, especially when I'm like, , we're really behind this month. What's going on? We started taking into things.
00:50:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then we mark, which is last time you called your vendors?
00:50:23 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What? No, it's the same kind of idea, right? Yeah. It's Joan, are you paying attention? So, you know, it's not saying she's not paying attention, but like you're immediately going to get her attention one way another by saying something like that. Yeah. Here, Dr. E is focused on making more money. That's the only reason he's doing PIs, not because he wants to help more people. Sure, that's part of it. But he's doing this because it's another income stream. And Joan is doing this because it's going to make her more money. If it doesn't make her more money, she's not going to put up with this extra stress and headache because this is more work and this is more stress than just clocking and clocking out. There's no doubt about that. But Chona wants to make more and wants to grow and you have to go through pain in the to get there sometimes. This is gonna hurt at the beginning. I don't think there's any two ways about it. Chona's gonna have to do a couple of things that she's maybe isn't comfortable doing because it's not all spelled out while we get it better figured out.
00:51:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think she's doing amazing. Every week, this is the perspective that we have to have and you have to take Dr. E is like every week, there is measurable growth that's happening. So new levels of awareness, every single week that are significant, we're only six weeks in. first 90 days of anything is almost always mostly just information gathering and topography. That's it. It's just mapping. There's learning and understanding and then understanding the layout of the land then coming up with the strategy. So the pace of this is already pretty good. And I know that you're like bigger, faster, whatever. But the reality is, I've built companies from zero to seven figures, my point is that those are small to big really quickly within a year, many times over, but the thing, and I've come into ones that I've just hovered around for like nothing and then just exploded, it happens, the pace of it and the structure is always the same, if they're going to be successful and not implode, which by the way, I've done that and I've watched people grow way too fast with their arrogance and sell too fast and everybody lost their jobs and everybody lost everything because they grew too fast and that was the main goal. So understanding the human resources and the human aspect of it and knowing that the brain can only process so many thoughts in the first place, okay, just learning, then learning how to optimize while also dealing with other people and their personality. all of these dealing with the pecking orders, dealing with all of that, this is a process that takes time. If you're not going to break it. Yeah, anyway, so it's on a good track, but you are the thing that you, it's an unknown. You're building in somebody else's house is the biggest issue right now. You have to decide if that house is compatible with your vision because you're still a homeowner of your own, right? You're like, I'm building a house on your property, not in your house kind of thing. So that's a better reality. So I still need to have autonomy over my house and can we cohabitate? So that's the unknown. Worst case scenario is it doesn't work out with Dr. E. You guys have learned a ton of things and you go take it somewhere else. But you need to, there has to be a possibility that, and It comes very powerfully with this energy of a take it or leap it. It's the power of like a few money. Basically, it's like, look, we know it's going to work. We want to be compatible. We know that this is your property. This is everything that you're doing. We want to do this with you, but understand that we're bringing the strategy, the awareness, the skill, the expertise. We're taking care of your clients. We're managing the tech, the billing, the whatever. We are optimizing everything and you get to read the rewards. What can't happen is you pull out the rug from underneath. That's the cutest off of the knees. What can't happen is you create a bottleneck that closes off everything when we've discussed having open flow and making this happen. So your energy, even if you don't say the words that harshly needs to be like, okay, we're working together, but understand.
00:55:00 - Chona Sweet
I'm driving this whole thing and that was the point is that we're driving so You know you brought out a good point because I feel like well first I'm new and the expertise and I'm feeling you know, I I going over that hump of You know feeling self-doubt or whatnot that you know, I wanted to drive this Within Dr. E stuff, but I feel like I'm not confident because I don't even know the the terms that's being used You know that that's that and the second thing about the building is he has his own thing I think the majority of it the main point is he still he doesn't want to let go of the full control because he obviously the contingencies of what if I leave he needs to make sure that he can control that Yeah, we started and he's gonna benefit that I can
00:56:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
help you with that by the way. This is just a conversation that you have. So sometimes I work with new clients and I'm not 100% sure that I want to stay there. And I will let them know that ahead of time. But what I will also tell them is if I grow with you to a certain point and I decide, you know, I want to go, I'm going to replace myself. I will hire and train and insert somebody and you will still be better off than you were when I got here. So you can't replace me and you should know that I'm that invaluable that I never had anybody be able to replace me. But what I can do is build a structure and train somebody and train the rest of your team and also be available for consult afterwards. So but what you should not try to do is try to own me, try to control me, try to pigeonhole me because I can serve the best being free to work my magic and do what I do. So yes, you're, you're new at learning these things, but you aren't just you, you're, you and Mark together. Um, you have just because you don't know the specific terminology and the processes and the way they do things doesn't mean you're not incredibly intelligent, powerful, um, innovative, all of these other things, right? So I go into people's businesses. never know anything. Everything is brand new. Like I understand business theory really well. And if I ask enough questions and get enough answers, there's probably no where I can't bring a tiny bit of value, if not a lot of value, but I have to be able to have enough experience. I have to be able to listen. I have to be able to observe. I have to be able to watch for a long time to wrap my head around it to bring any value. So it's all potential. It's all there. But if nobody answers questions for me, if nobody lets me watch anything, I can't give anything. So there's no point in me being there and if that's okay, if I'm not wanted and I'm not needed, then I shouldn't be there in the first place But we're under the premise that you're wanted you're needed to facilitate this particular thing Therefore you need to be given all the things that you need to including the time and the space To wrap your head around what exists there rather than coming in with a grenade and going okay We're gonna just build this and blow everything up. No, we're going to figure out how to be symbiotic We're going to figure out not only just how to coexist with each other, but you feed me I feed you we're nurturing and nourishing each other in This thing that comes with strategy strategy has to come with knowledge and wisdom and experience which only comes after certain amount of time but somebody has to be able to Articulate that and have that conversation and make sure that there's an awareness that this is what's happening because most of time and people are like freaking neanderthal level conversations, money, faster, let's go. Okay.
00:59:08 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know what you're talking about.
00:59:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I wasn't honestly, Mark, I've got lots of experience with lots of people and you are not that brute force. I mean, I hear it, but then you're like, yeah, yeah, I get it. I'm talking about there really are people that just can't even comprehend the things that actually have to happen at all. You have at least beacons of awareness that fles for a moment.
00:59:35 - Chona Sweet
Yeah. I think, you know, even Dr. E, one did he say that he told that to me I think a week ago, I think he's also trying to think in his head if I'm worth this. And I think when he, when I was taking care of a meeting patient and I called whatever, I forgot exactly what happened. But he said, actually you do. feeling, helping with the lean cases now is, you know, is really worth it. He said that verbally. So it's like, okay, that's good in my life.
01:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to give you a strategy that you can use. And that is, you know, when you're wanting to ask for something and do something. So not only can I help take the lean cases off of you and ease your burden there, but I can also add blank. So you want to remind him what he's already acknowledged. And you want to remind him that the because because people forget, Jonah, they forget what's good. They forget what's right in front of them. They forget the value. People do that. They do it in their relationships. They do it in their habits. It's just it's human nature. So you want to remind him there's already proven value. I'm going to bring more. You didn't even know like this could happen and how good this would feel. Now, you know what this feels like, wait till we actually get going. So kind And I suspend your stress and your doubts and your disbelief and, you know, let's get at it.
01:01:07 - Chona Sweet
Speaking of the devil, he's actually calling me.
01:01:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
can call back and do a conference call with me, you and him.
01:01:15 - Chona Sweet
You want me to talk to him for his waiters, other stuff we need to talk and I'll call you.
01:01:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Plus, I mean, to me, you work with plenty of these types of founders and everything. They get excited by Shiny Ball without any help. That's him.
01:01:28 - Chona Sweet
That's you and him.
01:01:32 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So, hey, here's Shiny Ball with how this coming through, because it's been 45 days, so like the newness of Chona is kind of wearing off like, yeah, because you I mean.
01:01:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't mean she's not. No, no, no, no. I do get you. That's why I said, oh, but that's actually the perfect timing to do the numbers and the forecasting that I'm talking about. And look at on paper, this is what we're talking about, and then saying, this is like, so then you reverse engineer it. So what's the capacity? Then reverse engineer that across the timeline and go, okay, well, here's where we're at now. You know, if we grow at 5%, 10%, whatever, and make it a reasonable, taking all the things into account, like how, what we could do that. So what does that pace look out? How far are we away from this number? And if you're going six months, nine months down the road, and that seems like forever, it's not, because how else are you going to get there? six months or nine months from now have all that revenue coming in, and this additional stream with all this new systems and understanding, and you just, that you could potentially go apply somewhere else, like a whole new level of awareness on top of the revenue stream. You can't wait six to nine months to, to let that be built out and, you know, deal with a little extra.
01:02:53 - Chona Sweet
Like, where does he think he's going to go get that revenue without any effort anywhere else? Right. I think the only number that, You know, Mark told him that he's kind of that his goal to reach is the 400 patients a month that cap that mark that's from that He can calculate how much it will be Do the calculations for him in a spreadsheet?
01:03:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can do it on our next week's call if you want to we can do it in the middle of week We can have a separate meeting to do it whatever, but and we can we could do a little whiteboard It's too late right now to be able to do that. gotta go check on my daughter But that we could do that together or you guys can do it, Mark You've got it. You've got enough experience to do that, but basically What is the pace potential so I know from Fuji's marketing and his timeline like 18 months from now for sure You guys could be doing that But you know with all the experience that you have and and the SEO cuz Fuji did his own SEO So you're also a jerk into difference that Chonazim is an advantage that Fuji doesn't
01:04:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And the reason with the people I work with of, hey, there's a conflict, but I want to make sure, you know, show those taken care of with working with good people makes total sense.
01:04:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, nine months from now, that's an entire possibility, but, dude, get out of the way, like, either you want it or you don't, you don't get to want to and control the things that you don't understand. Yes, you're the doctor, but there's more to the business aspect than having a medical degree and going and handling the patients and even owning the business. Like, this is his, this is not his realm. You're coming in and you're taking the mental load of it, organizing it, masterminding it, structuring it, and facilitating it.
01:04:46 - Chona Sweet
So, my question is this, before right now, short term, if I talk to him right now, and he said, did you guys do the emails? That's no. Okay. So, I'm going to have all new, I need my business card with my email then. then I will be the point of contact from this for this new patient as of right now. And then the second one would be phone numbers. Now, this is what I wanted to ask you, and also I'm going to ask myself, do I put my phone number there for right now? That's my question. It's like, can I really do that? What if I'm with the patient talking to a patient and all of sudden there's a lean call that I have to answer or...
01:05:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, I'm going to be to backtrack. So building the optimal system means doing things the wrong way once in a while. Sometimes you don't know until you try it, and then you might get a Google voice number that's not your actual number so that it's separate just for this business with that face for Mark.
01:05:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He told me to do this for two months straight.
01:05:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because you want to be able to segment things and not have your number be attached to all these things.
01:05:57 - Chona Sweet
just opens up a can of worms. Oh, that's the best.
01:06:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You could do Grasshopper, but Google voice is easier, it's cheaper, it's less hoops, it's a shorter learning curve, I mean, it depends on what you need to do, if you need to have a complicated phone tree, then Grasshopper would be better, because I'm not the pending pincer miserly, but I also do the level of intuition that's needed to be able to organize it. The bottom line is figure out what you need to happen, how you need the calls to be handled. If there are options like logic, if this then not, if they're calling at this particular time, if I want to be able to press this number, if I want people to be identified ahead of time. Like if you, and probably would be useful if you really think this through like, how could I process different types of people, can I give them option one if you need this option two if you need that, Grasshopper would be great for that, and then you can actually use the phone system to kind of help process people. Faster even just by putting them in the right category priority, whatever. So, you know, I you're triaging right I get to this person faster because they Raise their hand for this and that type of thing.
01:07:11 - Chona Sweet
So Then the grasshopper do like if there's a number that I choose and we'll put it on the That will be the one that we will send out Can it be one transferred? to a different number once we have the main person who is gonna be answering calls or what once we have the Ask them the questions because all numbers have different transfer rules depending on where you're transferring from and to the reason I was suggesting grasshoppers That's why I use my first start my firm.
01:07:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I've used it.
01:07:43 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's it's it's a great service Yeah Yeah Yeah, and To your point you can make phone trees like okay, it goes to let's just use castes things It goes to cast castes and pick up then it goes to chona chona doesn't pick up then it goes to x then it goes to y You can make the phone trees, so you've got the backups, or you have all of them at once who are picks up, picks up.
01:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So the first thing that I would do is the two of you to do this together is map out what would be the most strategic way to process any types of call, right? If you could have the phone system working for you and make your job as easy as possible, what would that look like? Then you go look and say, can I do this? And what's the priority? Changing the number isn't the priority. mean, if you have existing business, it's a thing. could have some issue. could potentially lose some business if you change your number. But if everything's going, well, why would you change your number? Number one, and number two, people can, we all have cell phones now. not like there used to be a roll index where you went and write things down.
01:08:53 - Chona Sweet
You just be like, hey, save my contact. Okay, believe me, I've updated.
01:08:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
know what I mean?
01:08:58 - Chona Sweet
I did. Before I forget. I forgot already.
01:09:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait.
01:09:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I was just going to say, we don't want to use the Dr.
01:09:07 - Chona Sweet
main number because right now it goes to who the hell knows. Okay. I remember now. Also, I wanted to make sure that there is a way where we can delineate, okay, this is coming from Chona because if they call that number and it goes to pass, they say it's for Dr. E's. You know, that's what that's why I really wanted my email to be the one, the point of contact that the email on the card like here.
01:09:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
have the. I love the way you're thinking and so the hierarchy of all of this is first you have to have a conversation about what is the actual goals and values that are driving because if somebody has an issue with a decision that needs to be made, the decision supports the goals and values. And they're getting in the way of it, then, okay, something is not aligning, right? Either this is the goal or it's not. If this is the goal, what the hell is your problem?
01:10:09 - Chona Sweet
Why can't we do this? now, there's two. One from him that's currently on, which I'm also taking care of right now. And he said he didn't say the amount, but he said he will also pay me higher on those because I'm taking care of them. And this is mine, the future one. And he said it's 50% of each consult and 20% of procedure. This procedure, I don't get because it's coming from him. So that's why I really wanted to deal with it, you know, but that Mark said whoever he's not working now, but it's going to be very hard. But I don't think Dr. E is going to, you know, he. He's a reasonable guy.
01:10:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He's going to be going to vote. Really? like your show says his, he's not really going to like push.
01:11:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it makes sense even just like I'm on GoDaddy.com like Dr.
01:11:06 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
E. Payne.com was available. Like would it even make more sense to just build out a separate site for his pain management stuff?
01:11:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They went to quarantine to build it up. Probably, but you want to think about it a little bit more through just to make sure that like you've thought about all the things that you need to think about. That's all.
01:11:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Because two separate email programs can be difficult for someone to handle.
01:11:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yeah, what is the whole picture? what does that open? And is it going to, for one small reason, create more problems than it solves? Probably not, but I'm just saying it's not as like, yeah, just QKN doesn't mean you should. Yes, there's simple logic in that, but the business is complex and it deserves the thought about every aspect and what are the adjacent issues, secondary, tertiary type of. of consequences, potentially, of creating that. Does it trigger any trust issues? Do they feel like you're trying to siphon anything off?
01:12:11 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
would be asking for is OK first without.
01:12:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, right. But the answer to my point is think about it, talk about the right diagonally, all of these different ways, explore that. But the one thing that you guys could do that would be the simplest thing, and just get a piece of paper and write it out. So where do all, where does the business come from? How would this business be handled? How would this business be handled? You could take a picture of it and send it to me, and I'll create something more professional, kind of flow chart. Mark, if you could, and I'm going to give you a homework assignment, and Tony, you can neck him forever. But what do the numbers look like if we get him 400 clients? Like, how did the finances work? How does he get paid? I guess Fuji does it, but he has a whole team of people that help him with different things. So what I need to see is the game plan written out. If you do that for me, I will help you come up with the pitch to basically be like, look, this is how I need you to get on board.
01:13:20 - Chona Sweet
I will be able to handle it as long as I don't help with the main thing.
01:13:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I just need you to write everything out. And if you can kind of do it almost like a flowchart, my map, so the segments build the containers and write out like this so that I can visualize it. But also then I can help you with handling the conversations with Dr. E and Cheryl. So anything that's related to Cheryl, if you can draw a little circle and kind of show me what Cheryl does and what you can do to help. I might ask it'll probably inspire questions so I'll ask you some other questions but we will get a physical representation of visual of what's happening and then where we're going and how it helps Cheryl and how it looks good for her how it helps Dr. E looks good for him and you guys because when people can see we can literally on the same page because a page actually exists does that make sense um it becomes very powerful there's always an epiphany and aha like holy crap that's not what I thought it was every time right Mark so um we didn't get to some of the other things that I have but that's okay that's the pace and the priority has to be what it is so just tracking your time and having that awareness that you did have right you can only learn so much every week you keep coming back with this this new something so Keep that up, you need to encourage yourself and know that you can't do all of the things, but if at the end of every day you can look back and inspect it and go, I learned this, I did this better, I made this grow, got traction here, I got momentum there, whatever. If you have a few of those to look at every single day, there's nothing wrong. You can't be superhuman and you should go to bed with some peace and be able to relax and go like, I progress today, I move things forward.
01:15:31 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, it's, you know, for right now it's just more of me getting faster and, you know, with my between being patients and charting, because some of my colleagues, they do it, the follow-up patients, they do it right there and there. I've been charting after, I've seen everyone. I do chicken because, you know, I do my notes little here and there and then I kind of perfect it after. It's really just making sure I don't charge the entire night.
01:16:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

So I could be wrong, but I'm just saying it could be just a decompressing. Don't be nitpicky. Damn. She's doing good.

It's not a matter of weekend, it's a matter of like, no, that one. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. will make sure that I will, there are information. Questions I need to get from him like we talk about we don't know if he's done the email yet was a plan because if not, I will just push it to just be my email in that.

So there's also if you're not first, you're last and second place is the first loser and I won't and so when you are in your death bed at your end of your life, what do you think you're going to be thinking about? You know, same thing with my dad that I still work to finish because that was all the way to the last day.
01:18:41 - Chona Sweet
So that's probably what's going to be for me.
01:18:44 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I just want to be realistic. know that's up to say, but I probably agree that would probably be how I end.
01:18:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

01:19:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How's this care is rough?
01:19:14 - Chona Sweet
It's fine. We have to.
01:19:17 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
doesn't matter.
01:19:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Neither here nor there. It's only theoretical. didn't. Okay. Well, we have wasn't leadership part of our studies.
01:19:28 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What happened?
01:19:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Leadership. Remember how we discussed leadership for a long time?
01:19:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
There's also jumping in and figuring it out instead of having everything.
01:19:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just go.
01:19:40 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Just go.
01:19:42 - Chona Sweet
faster. Now, I called you before to have us call and I don't know if you can hear it from me because I'm not sure of what even to say but you just you told me you're good.
01:19:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You're good.
01:19:58 - Chona Sweet
Okay.
01:19:58 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You're good. We're fine.
01:19:59 - Chona Sweet
Everyone likes you. I mean, works out, but it's of that talk, though, Mark, can we have more of that talk?
01:20:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What? it always works out?
01:20:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, just positive, like positive.
01:20:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I, okay, I'm only you.
01:20:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We have to understand the different drivers. Everybody has different drivers. some people, like, if you say that they're going to sit on their laurels, and they're not going to do anything, and they're just going to, you know, like Tyler. Tyler? Is that the right guy? Tyler? Right. Okay. Then there's other people who will take that little bit of praise and multiply it a hundred times over, and they'll want to go get more and work their butts off. That's who you're married to. I promise you, I saw your eye roll.
01:20:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, we've also had a discussion yesterday about how just hiring people is the solution to all of your problems, and having someone else do things is not the solution to all of your problems.
01:20:58 - Chona Sweet
We talked about that one.
01:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. How's that? How's that relevant?
01:21:01 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm missing something.
01:21:04 - Chona Sweet
Because I said, he mentioned about Dr. Dr. Fuji, I asked him like, how fast does Dr. Fuji talk to his patient and telemedicine? He said five minutes. That's not enough to get the history. And Mark said he have a VA virtual assistant that gets the medical history for him, all the relevant information and the type it in. And then I said, you know, like right now my mom had a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist and they emailed her the pre, know, type in your information. But, you know, that's that was my question. And I said, maybe later on, you know, I can have someone that can do that for me, which is basically the VA. And, you know, but when we get busy, that's what is.
01:21:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When you get busy, you're going to need to do that. But right now, the more that you understand about the operations from the ground. The better you will be at hiring, leading and delegating all of that to people, but for sure, but, you know, tuck that under your cap for some energy for later is that there could be help and you can spend more time kind of strategizing and doing in the high level operations and getting some assistance, but there's timing to everything. And at the end of the day, all I'm saying, Marcus, just be more encouraging.
01:22:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I would not be putting my reputation on the line. would not be putting how much time in her in general, if I didn't believe that she could do this and do these amazing things. I'm taking away from my own energy, from my own time, my own resources, my own reputation, because I want to see her succeed and do well and achieve what she wants to achieve.
01:22:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so all I'm saying is, no matter what you say to help her, at the end of the day, you're doing great because you can measure the things that she's doing well. And if you need help measuring what she's doing well, come to me, I'll be happy to help you with that.
01:22:57 - Chona Sweet
How can I get her to go faster?
01:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm coming to LA.
01:23:01 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'll meet with all of you in person Ronan's big puzzle do it. Big Can I come hug Ronan? I know Ronan tagged both Jonah not yesterday because he hasn't seen us in a little while and he was adorable.
01:23:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just get me a plane ticket and I'm come down and visit everybody and I'm just and then slap you once and I'll take a sandwich okay bye. All right Thanks for paying attention. appreciate that show. Mr. I want to go faster. The way that you do that is do the job. Write down what it looks like. What are the numbers if he gets 400 patients like what what is the revenue to you to him? Whatever what does that look like? And then we have to figure out what does it look like operationally. So how many patients are being seen every day? How many people like who's seeing him is Jonah doing all of that. So we need the structure that you're aware, written out, I'll have follow up questions, but from there, this is how we draw the map of, it's basically the treasure map for him to look at, and you to go, do you want us to get to the treasure or do you not like.
01:24:17 - Chona Sweet
Well, he loves to.
01:24:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, so get on board with the show him what he needs, like you're going to need a shovel, you're going to map, you're going to. Exactly, exactly, but it starts with that. So if you do that, and then Chona helps me with the operational imagery, then by the time we talk next week, we've got a really solid game plan for the next conversation that you have that really should be impactful. The only way it's not going to be super helpful and get you. To do some traction with him is if he's just not actually wanting what he says he wants, but then you'll know, because if it's that in his face and clear. here. And he's still cognitive dissonance, right? Saying one thing and doing another, then you need to make a decision like, because if people can be faced with all of that and still operate contrary to what they say they want with all the evidence, that is not going to change. That's a personality trait. That's an operational trait. That's not, you know what I mean? So, but then you'll know, and you'll know very soon. So, get those visuals. You know what the assignment is now? Yes. Okay.
01:25:34 - Chona Sweet
And Shona, you? Yeah.
01:25:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And also, Tina, taxes are Ronan pictures.
01:25:42 - Chona Sweet
Very happy to receive them. Thank you.
01:25:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, you guys.
01:25:47 - Chona Sweet
Have a good night. will talk to you soon.

## Quote 4

> Chances that is has less to do with how much money you are making and how much time you are working and has much more to do with:
* Lack of clarity
* Lack focus
* Lack of goals and
* Lack of priority
Let me break down each step and tell you why it’s these things and not just being broke and burnt out that’s making you miserable.
First of all, understand that being broke and being stressed in work, as well as being miserable, are all SYMPTOMS and not a cause.
The above items I stated are the actual cause of the problems, and knowing this is what’s going to help you actually SOLVE THE PROBLEM.
First, lack of clarity.
Clarity is crucial in order for the next three items to be achieved.
Unfortunately, but not uncontrollably, people don’t take the time to get clear. (While it’s not uncontrollable, sometimes people just can’t get there alone… more on this later)
Getting clear is about asking yourself the right questions.
WHAT DO I WANT OUT OF MY BUSINESS?
1. Do you want a certain kind of schedule? If yes (it should be yes) why? What is it that you want to do when you aren’t working?
2. Do you want a certain amount of money? If yes… why? How much money do you need to do what you want to do?
3. Do you want to make a difference in the market? Your community? The world? If so… what EXACTLY is it that you want to do and WHY?
Once you have answered these questions, make sure you have CLEAR answers. Not wishywashy, lukewarm, flexible answers. This is CRITICAL to getting the business that gives you an extra spring in your step and spice in your life. (Yes, it can really be that great.)
When you answer these questions, the answers should EXCITE YOU, when you think about having the business that does what you want it to do.
IMAGINE WHAT YOUR BUSINESS WILL BE LIKE WHEN IT’S “ALL GROWN UP”…
In other words, when you have created the business of its FULLEST POTENTIAL… no matter how long that takes… what does it look like?
NOW you know what you are creating.
NOW you know where you are going.
But what you also need to know some boundaries…. And THAT is crucial too.
What ELSE do you want out of life?
* Time with your family?
* Time to travel?
* Time to learn a new language or instrument?
* Workout?
* Get more rest?
It’s important that, when you set HUGE goals, like the one to create YOUR DREAM BUSINESS, you make time for a quality life NOW.
***NOTE… if you’re a “I gotta grind while everyone else sleeps” person… either read and learn or go on about your way… your future heart attack and break up are waiting for you***
Make sure that you have an “off” time and protect that time.
That will not force you to get less done… it just encourages you to be more efficient at doing what matters most.
Which leads to the next three items.
LACK OF FOCUS:
This is NOT the same as lack of clarity. Clarity is having a clear vision. Focus makes sure you never forget that vision.
DON’T ALLOW YOURSELF TO SWITCH TO AUTOPILOT… EVER!
Every morning, every afternoon, every evening, remind yourself of what’s important in all areas of life. Remember your health, remember your relationships, remember your mindset, and remember your vision for these and how your business will feed them. Plan your day, week, month etc, accordingly.
Next…
LACK OF GOALS
If you don’t know where you’re going, how are you going to get there?
Yes, you set your vision and got clarity (RIGHT?!?!)…
But you can’t just quantum leap to that destination.
You have to break it down into steps, into legs of the trip.
Reverse engineer and work backwards from that vision.
What has to be true?
When you answer that question, ask yourself, “Does anything else have to be true, FIRST?”
When you have broken that process down to the final thing which has no other prerequisites, BEGIN THERE FIRST.
You should have LONG TERM goals, 5 and ten years down the road.
You should also have yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly and daily goals.
The trick is, set your HUGE vision goals and WORK BACKWARDS.
When you ask yourself “If I reach this goal, what has to be true?” … and from each answer, ask yourself what else has to be true.
Work backwards until you find the thing that has to be true that is nearest to where you are now.
In other words, what’s the FIRST thing that has to be true?
Make that your first goal.
For example… If you’re going to be a millionaire… the first thing that has to be true is you have to have a plan, right?
So start with the plan.
Then you may need to acquire skills… so acquire those skills.
You may need to create products.
Raise prices.
Hire people.
Whatever has to be true next to get to the next level… THAT becomes your next goal.
Make sure you set goals for all areas of life:
* Set progress goals
* set financial goals
* set “quality of life”goals
* set growth goals
Make sure that the way you spend your time takes all of these goals into account.
Finally… the last lack that keeps you from being happy in your business is…
LACK OF PRIORITY
How many times have you started out the day, unsure of what to do, and you got “busy” checking emails, reading blog articles, “engaging” on social media, and found yourself zero percent richer or happier?
It’s because you have decided what your priority is in work tasks.
Decide what activities will get you closer to your goals fastest and do those first (more on this in a future post, stay tuned) and if nothing else gets done at the end of the day, you will still have moved the needle forward.
And THAT is whats going to create more happiness and less stress in your life.
It’s impossible to measure progress without a clear destination.
How could you possibly know if you are closer if you haven’t even defined where you are going?
We are destined to evolve as human beings.
The pull to do that is innate.
Feeling like we are not progressing leaves a dissatisfaction to the soul that is absolutely toxic.
You DON’T have to be brilliant to make this work.
You just need to be focused, decisive, and consistent.
These are all things you can choose to be, and choose to improve on.
FOCUS ON DECIDING WHAT’S IMPORTANT
Then, with a series of deep questions to yourself figure out…
WHY IS THAT MOST IMPORTANT
Then… simply…
DO WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT, FIRST
At the end of the day, you will feel the energy and satisfaction and confidence that comes from progress.
At the end of several days like this, you will grow more confident and hopeful.
As you continue to be consistent in these processes, YOU WILL QUICKLY BE ABLE TO MEASURE THE GROWTH THAT IS HAPPENING.
At that point, people tend to get hooked to the process.
If you have to be hooked on something, growth is the best addiction.
SIMPLE BUT NOT EASY. I CAN HELP
These steps are SIMPLE… Not very complicated.
But that doesn’t mean they are easy, or achieved without difficulty.
Sometimes you can’t see the forest for the trees.
Sometimes getting clarity, the first step, eludes you for so long that you give up on the rest.
I offer a consultation call that will help you get this clarity, regardless of what level of business you are at.
It’s $299, a two hour, very in depth call that has been likened to drinking from a fire hose because I’ll teach you so much…
But you’ll get the call recorded, notes, and, if my track record continues with it’s 100% success record, tremendous clarity on where you want to go, why, how you should get there, what you should do first, and for the next few months.
This or my group coaching program is my entry level access.
It’s the first step to making sure you get on track for the business and life you desire.

* Hiring for Small Businesses – Know the Order of Operations
*  28 September 2017  0 Comments
* * Hiring for small businesses can be a little like Algebra.
* * Remember how many people were absolutely in LOVE with math in school?
* * Especially those arithmetic expressions that looked like this? 4 + 2×3 = (4 + 2)×3 = 6×3 = 18?
* * Let’s not even get into Calculus.
* * Some people loved it, absolutely ate it up. But MOST people can’t hack basic math, much less advanced math.
* * Running, and hiring for small businesses is very similar in a couple of ways.
* First… Most people can’t hack it. It’s over their heads. Oddly… that doesn’t keep many people for thinking they can go into business for themselves and succeed.
* * Second… Running a successful business is absolutely all about the order of operations. If you do it wrong… things just don’t add up correctly.
* * For any business, but this is especially crucial to smaller businesses, it is important that you identify the most important position for being filled within your company and fill that role first.
* * The position should not be one of convenience as much as productivity directly related to the bottom line.
* * Let me give an example.
* * Joe owns a small business and he’s making some money. Joe feel like he’s not getting enough “stuff” done and also feels like he’s not making as much money as he could be.
* * Joe needs help… and Joe is fairly average… not immediately strategic about all moves. Like the average Joe he is, he translates “I need help” to “I need an assistant”.
* * Joe gets a little excited about the thought of hiring his own assistant. It makes him feel important and he thinks he can sluff off his work to some lackey and now… he’s going to get some serious business done.
* * The problem is… the things Joe isn’t getting done isn’t just minor administrative duties. Joe has a few problems.
* * First – he’s bleeding money and doesn’t know it because he doesn’t track his finances properly. He just knows he should have more money than he does. (Sound familiar?)
* * Second – He’s got a new product to launch that he knows his buyers will eat up based on the market but he’s had it for a year and not done anything with it because he doesn’t like doing the technical work to get it live and able to take orders. It took him two years just to get his first product to market.
* * Third – People are starting to ask for refunds just because they can’t get an answer fast enough when they have a question, and they don’t feel supported.
* * All of these things are affecting Joe’s bottom line.
* * Joe is not addressing any of them… and it’s not because taking the time to schedule appointments or pay bills or do research (typical assistant work) is keeping him from it.
* * Joe doesn’t do this stuff because he doesn’t like it and he can’t convince himself to do it.
* * But, if Joe DOESN’T fix these issues, 1) he will never grow far and 2) he could be out of business soon.
* * As soon as Joe hires an assistant… He’s immediately losing hundreds to thousands of dollars a month. Is that investment going to return to him immediately? In time or money? Is that going to improve his bottom line? Is it going to give him back enough time that his earning potential will balance out?
* * What might be a better first hire?
* * Joe doesn’t even know where all of his money is going. The first thing he needs to do is correct that. Hiring a financial assistant or CPA to manage his books should quickly point out what the next hire should be for Joe.
* * Yes, it will also show him some money management flaws he has and help him to get a better grasp on finances, helping direct him in other ways…
* * But it will also help Joe decide if what he should be doing next is hiring a customer support person or someone to get his product to market.
* * How?
* * Numbers.
* * The CPA loves that math that most of us hate. (Weirdo. God Blessed Weirdo.)
* * You need to know how much you make and how much you spend and more importantly… how much you are bleeding. I define bleeding is money that’s going out without giving you a return on your investment or too little of a return to justify the expense. Nearly every single client I’ve ever consulted with (possibly with ONE exception in 14 years) has had a standing expense on their books that was not earning them a return.
* * Getting a very clear grasp of numbers is an absolute eye opener. Sometimes people find out how easily they could improve their bottom line by just making a few cuts to wasteful areas. Other times they realize they aren’t putting enough money into something… for example, running ads that are performing well.
* * As you can see… hiring someone to help you get clear on your numbers can have a much more profound impact on your revenue, and almost instantly.
* * It is not likely that hiring a personal assistant will have as quick and powerful of an impact if this area is being neglected.
* * In business, a numbers expert is definitely one of the positions you want to fill first when you’re building your team.
* * From there, you want to hire the roles that will make the most significant impact on your bottom line in the shortest amount of time. This person might be the head of sales and marketing, fulfilment, IT or customer service… often in that order.
* * When you’ve taken the time to learn your numbers first, you know what you can afford for each of these positions and you should have a good idea as to what kind of ROI you can get when you fill the role.
* Do everything you can to make sure that your return on investment when hiring can happen within the first month. To that end, part of your onboarding process should include very clear expectations of roles and responsibilities, outline their decision making power and autonomy clearly, and make the targets very clear that they need to hit and by what date.
* * It’s not your job to tell them HOW to hit the target unless you can’t afford an expert and are going to train someone. In which case, (and it happens in startups with low initial capital) make sure you give them the outline and resources to learn what they need to learn.
* * Of course the “where” and “how”  of hiring for small businesses is a process all of it’s own. There’s a book that provides some fantastic insight into this process called “Topgrading” which (although bulky, in my opinion) can be extremely helpful to someone who’s new to the hiring process.
* * In my experience, I find that small business owners will take action on the least amount of information they feel necessary to make a decision. While learning HOW to hire is absolutely an important step towards success… It’s the second step.
* * First, you have to figure out WHO to hire. What’s the most important role to fill first? What does your company need most?
* * Even a bad hire can offer some relief and if nothing else, necessary experience for growth.
* * But hiring someone who cannot earn the company back their investment could put you out of business before you ever get a chance to grow past two people.
* * That’s the danger of being out of order.
* * End post -

Hello, hello. Hello, hello.
00:00:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can't hear you.
00:00:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I can.
00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It looks like you said you can, but.
00:00:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You can hear me.
00:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I cannot hear you. I can't of what they're working.
00:00:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Testing testing.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Testing one to. I can't hear you.
00:00:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I went into my own settings and check like aah.
00:00:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you?
00:00:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Good, good, 1996, I was Apple support. You're kidding.
00:01:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nope. No way.
00:01:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yup.
00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I supported PowerMax and the first IMAX and I also worked for Intel as a technician and I built networks and I supported their network adapters and so I talked to people in NASA and the Pentagon and helped them fix their networks and.
00:01:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Holy crap.
00:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's amazing. I can build a network from the ground up like the server including the cables I can crimp the cross over cables and networking cables and I'm a nerd.
00:01:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You're really cool. My first when I left Delight Tush I was actually where for computer sciences corporation when I left Delight Tush they had a hundred of me to go into the States and then when I left them in 1999 I started a software company hosting websites in Southern California and cable Tron systems, the competitor at that time to. that? The big one that's there though, didn't tell anyway funded us like over million dollars to use their servers instead for our server farm and it was a brilliant venture capital financing because like they find us as a million dollars but it was in equipment. So it's a win win for everybody right because that was the most expensive thing at the time. So different now right, but at the time like you could charge $50,000 to build a website and host it for these medium sized companies California.
00:02:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have been in it for a while. Corporate experience was my first business experience I didn't like it's really a long time to get comfortable with certain amounts of money and things and realize that that's what I was doing. Because I did the technical stuff but then I became a technical lead but I was responsible for hiring, managing, training, supporting. meeting metrics, meeting with the clients, meeting with the head honchos at Intel and at Apple. And I would also play Peaceball with them and beat them and then get free dinners because I want like what, learning about staffing and understanding the metrics because we were constantly getting threatened with losing our jobs. They would be going to either Costa Rica or the Philippines. And so the reporting was really archaic at the time and we had Lucid technology systems for our phones before they got bought out by Orion.
00:03:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
think it was or the other way around.
00:03:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah. But, and I fell in love with telephony rooms and systems and IT at that time, but so I figured out how to be proactive about learning our numbers and our metrics because what would happen is we would get yelled at, we would see our person coming down the road now. call centers where all most of them were entry-level job positions. Yeah. people come in and be trained and the managers weren't much better. were recovering drug addicts, you know, like the town that I live in, we rank in the top five for domestic violence and unemployment and poverty, and all these other things. And so that was the hiring pool, which made performing well really difficult. And so most of the head level leaders were imported from other places. But anyway, there was a lot of, you know, not really corporate kind of handling of things, a lot of threats, lot of, a lot of, a lot of, lot of things, a lot of sleeping around, all kinds of more accessible stuff. So, but if anything would go bad, you would just see them just down the aisles like, well, what just happened? Well, they got chewed out by Intel for not meeting metrics. And so now everything flows downhill. I got really tired of having my job buttons. I was a mom and I didn't want to like, I don't want to do this kind of stress. So like, how do I figure this out? And so one of my nerdy friends, who was also LDS, I'm more in church of Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints. Anyway, he's nerdy. And I would see him in Excel all the time. might teach me about this and he taught me about formulas. And I'm like, so if I took this report that doesn't have all the data I want. But if I could plug it into this spreadsheet and then have another tab that got this other report and another tab with this other report, I could pull this data from five different sheets and get a summary tab that had calculations that told us exactly where we are at with metrics. And he's like, yeah. So I took about an hour and figured it out. And so now what used to take people days and several hours to figure out because they didn't even know where to get the data. Which by By the way, the same situation I still find with business owners all the time when I asked their metrics, they're like, I don't even know where to get that. So, nothing's changed because that was, you know, years ago. Yeah, 28 years ago. And so, it would take me, once that started to happen, I just did it every week, every Monday I would get my data, took me about 15 minutes, so I'd import each of them and then just go make sure the calculations were correct and make sure I could wrap my brain around what was happening. They ended up implementing it worldwide, corporation as a worldwide company. And it took me probably 10 years before I realized how exceptional that was, had no clue. But they were using a system I came up with in an hour all over the world. Like, I still think about that, sometimes I think I probably don't appreciate the way my brain works. works and but also this is it simple systems yep so nothing has changed people still over complicate things and mostly it comes down to you they don't ask good questions and then they don't force themselves to come up with the true answer so when i talk with people i saw your post today and i'm like i bet we're very similar to the saying but you will probably ask the question and be like oh wait get the answer go ahead that's how i said i'll just be on a call and and they say i don't know i said okay let's find out and we'll have to go look at this and this i'm i got an hour you paid for it let's go get it yeah yeah yeah well all my other questions i love asking on like more like well it's business coaching but it's really life coaching where a lot of them always say like this is not to be about kpi's or metrics but specific to like you know sometimes they don't know the strategy they should do or that's not the right word but that is i always i think what if you did
00:08:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, like what if you didn't know, you know, you just keep digging and digging.
00:08:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tell me more. Yeah, tell me more is great.
00:08:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so that's interesting about your background. That is cool. So like, wow, have you thought about with your background then? explains why you're still going to what you do. Have you ever thought about starting your own software type company then?
00:08:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, there's a whole lot of things. This is the thing I've had to learn is that I'm really good at a lot of things, which is because I can doesn't mean I should. I'm working on my psychology degree and it has nothing to do with my business other than people also say, can I need you to be like coach Tina today? And I have an attorney in LA and they do about four million a month. And he says, do you help people find their purpose? I was like, nobody hires me for that, but it's happened accidentally. Yeah, you're talking.
00:08:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
There's a lot of skills that I have, but what I feel called to most.
00:08:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. is being God's love. And there's just not enough, but there's very judgy Christians. There's very, there's just a lot of pain and anger. But are you familiar with the parable of the seed? Not the mustard seed, but the seed that landed in the desert, landed in the rocks, landed in the, and got blown away. Like there's four different places, I think, where the seed landed. when it landed in good soil, that's when it grew and nurtured. And so I don't have to really preach the gospel. I can be God's love. I can be the example so that when the time comes and they get introduced or they're ready to live any kind of way, he won't be strange to them because they will have felt unconditional love. Because, sorry.
00:09:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's okay.
00:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But God's house. to the house of water. I bring order to their business and it comes out in their homes. When I help people install boundaries into their lives, into their business, they install them in their daily lives with their spouses, their kids, with themselves, with their friends, their lives change and they become stronger, they come and more independent, they become better leaders, they become more sovereign beings and to me, that's the kind of people that are God's people. So even if they don't really feel like I still feel like I'm serving Him and giving His love. So there's a lot of different ways we can serve but I feel like my best, like I used to post on social media a lot, the reason I haven't been out is because I really felt like I needed to concentrate and think of like when you get concentrated juice versus when it's watered down. potency is different. so there was a time I felt like I needed to concentrate more on my immediate sphere, on my children, on my sweetheart, on my sisters, on my friends, on the closer people. And I feel like I've been able to serve and strengthen them well enough that now I can go out and increase in my circle of influence. But it is really going to be around strengthening people, helping them become their best selves, become the leaders that they can be in their own spheres of influence. And again, there's lots of ways to do that. But really, it is through teaching people, improved operations that, you know, it starts with business, but it really applies to life and they and they overlap because it's people that run business and people that run their lives. I won't be distracted into any other Shiny object and opportunity because this this is my calling for sure.
00:12:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Cool and it's funny like and I don't know how much work will get done right now this call because we can hook another call right um and don't pay for it. just want to the book. Oh no it's fine. Yeah getting to know each other but that like it's fun you know because we all went through a lot of life stuff over the last few years um when my dad did pass away I like obviously I went on a downward spiral because I was the closest to my dad of all the siblings like and I was the youngest one right so the baby and uh how many siblings do you have?
00:12:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's it? How many siblings do you have?
00:12:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Three.
00:12:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay just wanted to put that in perspective okay.
00:12:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh got you have older sister older into all their older brothers and um I think and I'm the only one that's the entrepreneur the rest are scientists chemists and yeah my sister's a uh doctorate in uh pharmacology toxicology and and she's a cool stuff of children's age research you know. When it. like there's more than 90s and stuff, she's retired now. yeah, the other two are engineers, but so I went the business route. But I think also, because I'm the youngest too, I always I realized after my dad passed away and all this life changes about my own inner work, is that I realized I was doing a lot of things to please my dad. I didn't realize that the laughter. And I also asked my mom a few times because she's very spiritual and I said, know, like, what do we hear for? You know, because it's like, what is this early all about, you know, because that was the first close death to me. And it's an interesting, my mom said, well, it's it's to be God's love, you know, so it's funny what you say, because like, you know, lot of people have different answers, like, why are we here on earth is that? But that's why mom says, it can be that simple, you know, and I'm like, wow, I never thought of it that way. So, so yeah, I'm sure there's a reason you're right. Well, I are process connected. We say, if you're big hug, I'm a big hugger. Oh, thanks. Yeah, yeah, so so I've been having fun the last little bit. I'm helping some people with their their funnels and all that, so. I'm not sure which way you want to go, you know, what do you want to take this call?
00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what I want to know is you had notes. You had notes when we talked to you said you have ideas. I want to hear for those ideas.
00:14:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
will pay to hear those ideas. Oh, OK, I have to go up and get it.
00:14:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's in my I'm downstairs right now. Do you mind?
00:14:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't mind. I'll wait. No, yeah, what I'll do just give me about five minutes because I got to go find the art book. I can't remember whether it's up in my office still or over.
00:14:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have like three places in my home I work from. I am not in in a hurry. My life and my work is so leisurely. Maria and the people that I work with, I choose the same kind of vibe.
00:14:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So whatever it takes. I'll just do some stuff. Yeah, give me about five, seven minutes. I'll actually put the T kettle on too and make a cup of tea. And because I, yeah, like I, it's funny because I'm going to take my mom to the art store again soon, I was like, oh, out of artwork. So I have to find where I put it, because it was once after your meeting, it was full.
00:15:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, so give me five, 10 minutes. I'll be right back.
00:15:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
cool, love it.
00:15:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. You You You
00:22:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You All right, she's getting back. Oh, no, it's keep going. I'll just keep breathing.
00:22:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Keep going. My little FTT month slack. Okay. Yeah, I'm right.
00:23:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Cool. Cool. I brought my iPod down to and connected it and we can even just be drawn as if you need to go to. Yeah, I got this an action. can take a picture of it, send it to a boxer after or, you know, yes, please, ma'am. Yeah, I'll do that.
00:23:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let me go with going people about to telling friends about you about how awesome it was talking to you and what your notes look like when we were done.
00:23:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
like, oh, her brain is different. I want to see it.
00:23:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cool. What's like that?
00:23:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm a weirdo. I love it. love it. Let me. Oh, well, you're going to be able to see the picture. But anyways, there's one picture we didn't I remember from the last call that was the beginning as well. So we thought just doing some the audience building with some quality videos. So this thing I just sent you this on Voxer, like it was kind of the videos you see video one and then V2 for video two. So video one is just about client's day with me for nine years. So I thought that was huge. So I really just took notes of some of the kind of repeatable tuples that you say as well, but it was really too, I don't know like what I did, hey, hey, hey, no, Merlin, no, sorry. doggy. Was that a dog? Yeah, yeah, he's I don't know how well you can see it.
00:24:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There he is. Merlin. Yeah. Oh, he's so cute.
00:25:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's probably getting scared because I think there's a big thunderstorm coming our way. You know, when the heat dropped, the heat got so hot, you know, all that could be storms coming. So yeah, the wind now just picked up and yeah, anyway, yeah. then, so, anyway, so yeah, so the thoughts I had were to just start creating this kind of connection. I don't know if you want to call it a connection connection, social funnel or culture, social funnel, whatever the words out there that people use nowadays. But it's really a bottom line just creating these three to five minute videos. We're just giving good value content with no intent to sell right away, even though obviously that's what we're going to do.
00:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're building up your invisible list, so to say, right?
00:25:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So for example, like me, Karina and I have one video. video where I scripted for her and I said, hey, just do this, like 10 reasons to trust us, right? And she's Shopify certified partner. So she kind of lists 10 reasons to trust her like, hey, I've also built a million dollar business on Shopify, still on the boutique, it's still running, all these things. it's not really like, okay, my stuff. It's more just, hey, here's 10 reasons to trust it and it shows, hey, I don't want my mom, you know, with my husband and kids and stuff. so, but funny enough, that video brings in sales. I was just looking at ads this morning and showed the purchase column and it's like, don't know exactly which thing they purchased because we have a few things. That business model is more like what we call the, do you remember the Sears catalog?
00:26:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yes. Yes, I do.
00:26:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And Avon catalogs.
00:26:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you remember when we opened? I'm also Avon and Tupperware and Mary Kay.
00:26:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes, do. Yeah, so like, there's so many ways, as you know, to build a business that makes sales. But one of the ways that I think is like strong now, um, because of technology and social media reach and adds the way it's beneficial to videos. Anyway, like, you know, we all bought through catalogs when we're younger or my mom too, like she's Avon seller and and and Sears catalog come wait to have it come out and go buy. Do you need the Christmas catalog? Yes. And then I busted my marketing chops going through the JP Peterman catalog before the internet existed. So I would like learn from the direct sales master's back then was like, yeah, yeah, Robert Colier. I used to buy for me, be his antique books used to be a pastor and then became. Oh, wow.
00:27:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I did. I did Don Don happy days.
00:27:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, I'm not Don Tom Bosley's SNC.
00:27:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, okay. Don Don the pre's as like, I did my tone and everything. and Melaleuca and everything and a lot of my friends are in direct response and oh cool one of my clients is Brian Kurtz as partner so I've been working with him for six and a half years and Brian threw that as well so yeah it's it's a small world I was I was going through because I do my research and looked at all of your Facebook profile things because that's what we do it's we suck face images and I saw a picture of you with Seth Laraby. Seth sensed my sweetheart my fiance to go on the internet and be on Facebook and now we've been together for 10 years so oh my god small world how we all interact and impact each other in a professional way but in in a really personal way because I was not looking to date I was I was gone through divorce and he was um well I told God if he wanted me to be
00:29:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
with anybody you'd have to drop them on my lap. So I love it.
00:29:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
love it. Yeah. I was coaching soccer and raising four girls and teaching music in Sunday school and running business. And anyway, but, but yeah, our history is amazing. I was looking at it and I saw something you did saying you've been doing this for two decades. I'm like, I've never met another woman that's been doing this this long. And then the post today about people call you like the mom of their business.
00:29:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, I've never heard anybody else be that, but I've been that for a long time.
00:29:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm like, this is just like, how did it take so long to even know? That's what I'm like.
00:29:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But anyway, that's cool. That's cool. Yeah. Well, actually, when my dad started getting sick about three years ago, I kind of hid for a while. So I wasn't really as much. I was buying the scenes as the chief marketing officer for a couple of companies.
00:29:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, so, so yeah, going back to the catalog model.
00:29:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So yeah, we have a of my business model, because I have a percentage of her company, is more selling all the little things like this for three bucks, this for 20 bucks, this for $30 like a catalog model. So, because once they find one thing, as long as they're good quality products. And of course, you just have some mid ticket, like $500 and $4,800 high ticket. But most of the sales are driven through the low ticket. And the exit strategy, we figure for that in a couple of years is the boutique brain software, AI software that we're going to come out with in about August. But so for you, we don't know what path and since you're so open talking about it's cool, we don't know what path even God's going to have for you. But I know that if we start creating your audience, that's something cool could come or we just stick with what you already are, you know, selling. But the first step is like just spend the first month or two, sort of my cats, stairs, it's a bedroom divergent office.
00:30:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think they're just all going bananas because I'm down.
00:31:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
here.
00:31:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's cuddles, but what's going on?
00:31:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, it's only 334 here and she doesn't get fed to five, but she's acting like it's five. So anyway, so one of the things that we should just do is like just like all these videos, we start creating them and then run $5 day ads to them and to find out which audiences are working and which videos kind of work better and then there's KPIs that come into place.
00:31:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, you know, many people stay watching 25% of the video?
00:31:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What's the cost for 25% of the video? Because like when I first started now with Ginger for about a month, it started about $0.70 to $1 for every 25% video view and different angles like Gary Vannerchuk audience, Marie Forleo, a reporter field, digital marketing, software companies, because she builds websites for people. And So, in her case, after a few weeks, we found some of the better audiences and tweaked some of the videos so that she now has more like under 50 cents video view, which is like almost a hundred percent decrease in her cost of building her video views audience. And when you, Green and I have been doing the video views for over six months, we're now down to some videos are getting like 10 cents per 25 percent video, which is really good. Yeah. every day's for sure. Yeah. Yeah. So every week we can, you know, gain like about 2000 people that and they're not just watching 25 percent of the video view, then percentage of them go on and watch like 75 percent of the three to five minute video, which is priming that person then to whatever, say just to choose a simple model, like let's just open and close, Hey, the higher ticket product three days every month. So So for Kreno, we're opening and closing a thing for $500 for the next three days. because we've built up so much brand equity from the video views and value videos and I don't know the right word for it, it's not culture equity, it's not community equity, maybe it's connection equity, but like silly videos too about like 10 reasons to trust us are a little bit more about you, know, like the client stayed with me for nine years. I don't mean that silly, the word silly is the wrong name for it, but it's like not a typical direct response video where you're teaching here's right for you to double your average order value, which are good videos to have to, business, know how to, but the client's statement for nine years just build a, wow, that's a big deal.
00:33:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, a huge person of why people will say you don't keep talking to anybody that doesn't have a personality.
00:33:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I have personality.
00:33:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It will come out, but if I were just to talk about the business stuff and not show my personality, which means there will be silly videos, sassy videos, things like that. It is for people to stay with you a long time, they have to have relationship. You're not going to have a relationship with anybody that is tedious to listen to. That isn't entertaining to some point, and especially that you don't feel so to feel connected to somebody near a neuron being what they are, you have to feel like they see you. How do I make people feel like they're seen through the video? Well, it is through talking about my stories, and I know you've experienced something like this, not this, and the language, the nuance of the language is really important. I have a client, I keep brow beating him with these like, nobody's doing this, nobody's ever seen this. I'm like, you're wrong about that. You haven't seen anybody else doing it, but to be so arrogant as to think that you're eight figure and I'm for your clients. I've never seen anybody do this. They're playing in a different pool than you are. First of all, they're all over the world. And I know people who are doing what you're doing. They're just not broadcasting it. They're secret weapons working silently behind the scenes. But what I'm going to tell you is the one day that somebody besides me tells you, you're not the only one doing this, like it's going to hit his ego really hard. And it's just just being mindful. Like you don't have the Lord over people. Because you know you have a powerful, potent skill. I am incredibly rare. Few people can do what I can do. But I also know there are a lot of people who can do things I can't do. I am cut off at the knees if I have to do everything by myself. Some things I can do by myself which makes me powerful. Yeah. Building my own business, I cannot do by myself because I will lose. I am a social creature. I draw energy from other people. So in serving other clients, there's always other people, but I can't do that for myself. So what good does it do to be great at business if I can't do it for myself, by myself, right?
00:36:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I need people.
00:36:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And anyway, making videos and helping people see one of my, I think special talents is, and I get this from a lot of people is they'll have something in their brain for a really long time. But because they've never spoken in, and a lot of times even they've tried to, and they don't know how to, but somehow I'm able to find the words and it's usually a story or an analogy and say, it's like this, where they're like, I've never heard it put into words. And sometimes it's years that they've never heard the words spoken, they've never heard articulated, which means they've never understood it themselves, and or felt understood by somebody else. And so what I found in my years on Facebook, which has brought me all the business I could handle up till now is that even in my posting, just written text, people feel that, people feel connected to me, people will tell me a post of mind changed their lives. I have people that are making videos that have huge followings that never made a video until I did a video challenge about 11 years ago, and they made their first videos. now video is their life and their TikTok and Instagram and YouTube stuff. And I just think, I don't know how a big ego about it, but I wonder how much I showed up and people were following me and they had been following me, but silently, we weren't connected, but now I've had people send me jewelry that they made. one girl sent me a shirt that said, Team Tina on it. And I just post a little bit of stuff, so I know that. I do know how to connect with people and to the we don't know what God is going to call me to. I don't care what works or how it works. I care that I work, meaning that I shoulder to the wheel elbow grease work. Yeah, I mean, what comes out of it is always enough. I always have what I need as always taken care of. I've been poor, I've been rich, I've been everything in between and that doesn't matter. What matters is that that I'm doing the work, so I don't have a lot of attachment between the work very easy to do because the goal is serve people and I'm taking care of. It's always been like that. God has made it that way. If I will go where he wants me to go then he will. So in terms of like these videos, the picture that you sent me. these are things that I feel so okay. In terms of like what I could get from help with you and it's. also crazy too that at the same time as I found you and I'm like I really want to talk to this lady because you stand out and all the ways I told you you did. I've got these old clients that want to do work and it's a husband and wife team and their kids have watched them grow up and we work together for you here and she wants to do this because I had put together your hosting can I share my screen? Yeah absolutely and I'm just going to the the TV automatically went on down there I'm just going to go turn it off hold on just let's see you
00:40:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, back back back, here we go.
00:40:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I showed her this yesterday, whoops, apparently I'm on my keyboard. That was like this, I'm not greedy. I want to work on a profit sharing model. I mean, not just that, I'm willing to pay base pay because I'm all pizza, I get paid plus rev share. But there's also, so there's a couple things like, for example, my fiance is very wealthy, but I, I keep a very independent work of my business and the biggest reason is because I want to be able to show women what's possible when they're doing it on their own.
00:41:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And that's been a huge thing before we get married. I'm like, I need to have accomplished a certain amount of things, not pride, it's not ego, it's evidence based.
00:41:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
People listen to the people that they feel like understand and have gone through things because I've gone through a lot as a single mom. And because one of the the biggest ways to convince someone is to be like, I've done it. Yeah. So to kind of take the excuses away. Anyway, but the other thing is like, you know, in the men's world, they're ref sharing partnering, helping each other make money all the time. women are just paid. can't tell you how many millionaires I've made, Maria. Yes, I know. Well, going bankrupt, by the way, I fired a client when I had no other income.
00:42:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It was, they built something called Coffee Shop Millionaire, this dude named Anthony Trister.
00:42:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, it took them two and a half years to make a product and launch it.
00:42:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
When they launched it, it's made $80,000 like in a couple of weeks, but then it goes out to $3,500 a month on ClickPink.
00:42:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so they did that two months in a row, they're like this sucks. And his partner's name was Manish. Well, I met Manish through Eric Luvier and job crusher. And because I was working on job crushers payroll for a while, right around divorce, transition time. And Manisha, hey, can you help with some tech stuff? Because I can do all this technical development. I made my bread and butter customizing WordPress themes for a while. Like I can do the copy.
00:42:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I can do the graphics. can do everything.
00:42:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Anyway, Um, so I came in there to help them with some, some tech stuff, some automations, but they had a developer. And the biggest thing that they did was they had created this. It was, you know, make money online activity coffee shop millionaire. He was not a millionaire. So there's integrity issues already.
00:43:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, and what Anthony did was just went around and hustled.
00:43:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He was in the affiliate market and the, you know, the mastermind circuit, all that stuff. Well, by the third month of $3,500, they had asked me, would you be our business manager?
00:43:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because I would ask them questions. are you doing this? Why are you doing that? Why are doing this? Yeah.
00:43:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Finally, um, four months into working for them. So I started in March, which by the way, this is how God is. I had zero clients. I had taken my girls into homeschool because my ex was abusive.
00:43:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I was like, if you're going to get bullied at home, you're not going to get bullied at school.
00:43:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Also, I can't at least keep you here. can watch you more. So I hadn't taken any clients. for a while. So I had no money. A week after I left, I got this job and was on payroll and was able to take care of my family. So God is so good. Anyway, this is all relative to what's happening. So this is my first time making a million dollar company in less than a year. And so took the two and a half years to make it, did their launch 3,500 a month for a few months. And then I'm like, why am I even your business manager? You should go find somebody else because you don't listen to me. You don't do any of things I tell you. You have the same conversations week after week after week and I wrote money. They get paid to hear this stupidity all the time and be forced to listen to this. I have to take care of kids.
00:44:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't want to do it in business too.
00:44:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they're like, fine, we will do what you say. Eight months after I started working with them, they had three other products on the market and they had broken a million dollars in sales. That was not them. partially for sure. But they were spending their rills. They didn't know how to do it. And then, are you familiar with Ryan Moran?
00:45:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:45:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, he wrote a book last year, I think, called 12 Months to a Million Dollars. It was about a company called St. Labs that I helped him build as his business manager. So they were already doing pretty well. But when I came in and I have a testimonial from his partner, I helped them 400 times what they were doing.
00:45:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. No, I remember you were mentioning that.
00:45:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was like, yeah. So and all it was better meetings and whatnot. But anyway, those people will profit share profit share.
00:45:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They were paying me $15 an hour, Maria. Yeah. That's the hour.
00:45:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. Yeah. And so then I was like, I'm no, not going to do this. Okay. So I had to do this whole quitting thing, big drama.
00:45:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They came up, okay, well, we'll you $40 an hour.
00:45:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So within a few months, I was getting paid $500 an hour, but not for from them. And then Ryan called and offered me to one third of his company, if I would come down to Austin and run it for him. He said, everybody's got their prize, Tina.
00:46:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, you can't pay my Ryan.
00:46:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't hate men by any means, bags, and they can be nail and female.
00:46:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And there's lots of I agree, I just don't want to work with them.
00:46:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, so you may or may not have any interest in this. Shando did. And she's like, I will, I will do this. This is not ownership, but it's profit sharing. I want to be able to own my content and what I create because this is my two decades of experience and things. But, and I don't know if you would have any interest in it. I, there's definitely an overlap, but there also could be multiple marketing efforts coming because I create content and you two have very different personalities. And maybe I wait and see what happens with her and if it doesn't work out see if you want to I don't know that sounds kind of do She to me, but I'm also just a Throw everything out.
00:47:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I bomb it and see what happened. Oh, yeah I mean never know until you start working with someone, you know Yeah, we want to go what would the topic of this be this product?
00:47:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So this is So I have a I've put together a We'll call it an e-book right now. It's ultimately going to be on it. I think it's a crap I think it's gonna take a long time No, that's not it. Hold on sec There's my VSL from like 12 years ago for a product I mean I called my freedom systems 20 minute VSL because that was the thing and they worked Yeah, yeah, it was crazy. Um, let me which accounts my Sorry So, so first of all, there's some, these could be trip wires, they could be free. I could do, I've got like nine different things. I think the ones that are the most powerful would be simple finance systems. This is, these are all first draft, but transform your business finances. Actually, you know what, let's go to the time one. I'll show you the time one, because I had people do you know who Tyler Ellison is?
00:48:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, probably if I saw him, I might recognize some of the stuff because he is a media buyer.
00:49:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And, matter of fact, he was the media buyer for sheer strength labs when it got started. That's Ty.
00:49:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We're cool.
00:49:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And he, he's been doing stuff with the Annalene anyway, he bought my program 12 years ago and said that this time sheet homework was worth the $97 out by itself. And I had a lot of people go through it, let me see, open it up real quick. But, and I won't say nobody else does this, but this is definitely not a, everyone does this kind of thing. few people do it. So I have three primary, well, four primary principles, I would say, hold on, principles and priorities, finance, time tracking, let's see those three. The first thing is just teaching people about principles and priorities. And the reason is one of the biggest issues that people have is that in the same reason that we have people showing up to meetings and you're talking about the same thing and it didn't get done. Why didn't get done? Were you not working? Of course not. Of course I wasn't not working. I did this instead. I did this and said, well, why did you not do the thing? Because it wasn't a clear enough priority to me that I knew that that was what I had to be working on. And the reason that is is because we didn't establish values. So even when you're one person working in your own business, a lot of times people just sit. All right. What do I do today? do I need to work on? Well, if you have established that you need to work on X because X is going to give you this and Y and Z can't really be done well until X is done. Then you're very clear that X has to be done because it is, it's the cornerstone. own of everything else that you're doing. But you don't know that unless you've asked yourself what matters. Well what matters. And then you get into and almost all the time people can't tell me what does matter. What they can tell me is what they don't want. They can tell me I don't want to work after six o'clock. I don't want to deal with bad clients. I don't want to do my taxes.
00:51:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't want to do you know what I mean?
00:51:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's like types of activities, types of people, amounts of times and how much money they want to get paid.
00:51:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Those are some very clear I don't want this.
00:51:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But they can tell me what they don't want clearly without being able to confidently say but I do like people can tell me I don't want to work past three o'clock but they don't want to say I want to be done working by three. only want to work six hours a day. It's this weird thing it's almost like they haven't given themselves permission yet. So I removed that. They don't even know I've removed it. They don't care that I removed it because I'm me them say it in a way that didn't scare them by saying, I don't want this because they're good at saying what they don't want. Anyway, all of that can be done in a little product, a little seven dollar product, $20, whatever product. When they've determined that, but sometimes they can't determine that. So sometimes we have to mix it with this activity. And this is the thing that has brought people hundreds of thousands of dollars just by going through this because it's a mindset shift. So when you figure out your mostly profitable activity, I had a real estate agent, he went through this, he's like, holy crap, I'm spending my time doing whatever kind of basic stuff when really my money making comes from showing houses. So I need to get this stuff off my plate. I sometimes people just don't ask themselves what's their most profitable activity. Most people, ask themselves what their most profitable activity is. Then you think about what's the other stuff because you have to know what's there. And then when we get to the time sheet exercise, I'm going to wrap this up really fast because I'm sure you probably have another call. Time sheet exercise, a lot of times people will under predict how long it'll take. Well, it's only going to take me half an hour to write this copy. Yeah, plus six hours, something like that. You know, people tend to underestimate.
00:53:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So once we start talking, I try to do that all the time. Yes.
00:53:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So but once you start to be more mindful of it, you start to be able to better engage and then you give yourself a little break and go, Oh, the reason I didn't get this done is because it takes longer than I thought it did. Yeah. So then you start to give yourself some grace and time things better. So but then a lot of times they'll plan out their work week, but they won't take into account that is gym night. Well, for me, when I go to the gym, the next day I am diminished. I don't have as much strength. and energy. I'm tired. I need like 10 hours of sleep that night instead of eight. I'm going to eat more the next day because I've left heavy weights. And so the day after needs to be calculating what's happening that day, people don't do that generally speaking. so they're just like, I'm dragging what orchestrate a day that is compatible with the activity of going to the gym the night before. Date night, a lot of times we'll energize people if they have you know, a good experience with it. And so I talk about energy sandwiches. If there's something that really sucks in your life and you have to do it, sandwich it in between the really good stuff. Yeah, yeah. So anyway, these are things that and I bought another hour so we could schedule that another time and go through it because at the very least, I would love to have your mind just say, this is what I think that you should do. This is where I think you stand out.
00:55:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's part of why.
00:55:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm talking so much because you have experience so you could say, Tina, I've never heard this where I rarely hear this. We need more of this in the world.
00:55:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think if you say that to me, I'm going to trust your expertise because you've been around a long time.
00:55:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I benefit from you specifically because of that. So my, I'll tell you all my modules if I can get to my chapters. So principles priorities start by defining what matters most.
00:55:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Simple finance systems, what comes in, or it needs to be greater than what goes out.
00:55:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Time mastery, making the most out of the hours you have, things like that. Business and project management, it's the same thing. It's teaching people the simplest, but as you can see, they build upon each other. Knowing what you want to earn and how much you want to earn starts and works best when you have your priorities and your values. Because so many people are like, I'm going to earn a million dollars by that. Why? Well, so and so did. And I'm like them. Yeah. Like, well, that's, you know, that's not gonna make you happy. Anyway, dream team, people want to hire when they have no business hiring, when they have no skill about delegating, when they don't know how to train, when they don't even know how to hire. And they want to go spend $3,000 a month when they're making $10,000 a month to hire somebody.
00:56:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't know how to lead.
00:56:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So a whole long conversation about before you do this. Here's how you do this optimally to get your money back and to increase your energy, not just your revenue, by who you bring on to your team. Optimizing iteration, scaling, which is not the same optimized, obviously is making it work the best you can scaling it is growing what's already working good. And this, I don't really hear people talking about this but sharpening your saw, whatever you're good at, keep getting good at it, keep getting better at it. They're one of the reasons I never lose clients. I won't say never lose clients, but I have it. I fired them. They haven't fired me is because when I feel a lull and they're showing up and we're having the same conversation and there's no excitement and they're like, yeah, everything's okay or everything's good. But they're not like, oh, great idea, Tina. But they don't say that to me for a little while.
00:57:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I need to go have something better for the table.
00:57:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But also I become happier because I'm investing in myself and I'm learning more like working on my psychology degree so I can understand how the brains work better and how my people work better and things like that, including my own children, finding your heart. We lose people, we lose pets, we lose spouses, we lose parents, we lose kids. If we don't fortify our brains and our hearts and our spirits, like filling them up with good books, good stories, good understanding. underdog stories, especially things like that, then when things go bad, we don't have anything in the tank to go and help us through this. But it's inevitable that a human will go through this. That human that's running a business is going to take their business with it. And all the people that rely on them and work for them and the families that rely on their parents who work there. So I just want to fortify the people that lead and the businesses that they lead. And this is what I'm doing. But all of this is segmentable and iteratable, which means there is a tiny portion that I can give away, a tiny portion I could sell at the next level. There is an ascension in all of these. How a person who's making zero money applies this is going to be different than how a person who's making $10 million a year applies this. It's going to be different than how somebody making $100 million a year applies this. But all of these principles will apply.
00:59:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Does that make sense? It does, it does.
00:59:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, like, how does this work? There is a personal story in anecdote several and infinite really for all of these in terms of stories content creation of my own of other people calling in other creators and collaborating with them. This is a this is a community thing like we all need these things we all have had these issues and nobody is ever mastering all these things at all times. No. So, this is timeless. I'm not the expert in all of it, but what I bring to the table is the depth of the conversation so that you and your own skill and your own talent and you talking about these things with the brains around you and the hearts around you are going to be better and going to be four to five for your whatever investment in this is going to pay you back over and over again. I'm confident about that.
01:00:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What's the example Jack's 90-day plan?
01:00:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Whoa, where are we at?
01:00:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, on the left-hand side, I'm looking in the table of contents, yeah.
01:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's realigning his actions with his vision values. Jack set a goal to increase his digital marketing agency's client by 15% over the next 90 days. Using the smart framework, Jack made his goal specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound. He then created a 90-day plan to break this goal into actionable steps, so I actually have like a 90-day roadmap of these are the things that we're going to do. But they're not, that is a pace, and it wasn't actually Jack, it was Dan, between you and me. But the pace is very specific to the person and what happens most of the time, is people get overzealous in the pace, and they're mad that they don't get there, and then they feel like they feel feel feel. And worse, they feel like their team has failed, and then whole thing. Dan is very laid back, so this is much slower. This tends to happen over a year, but we did create the 90-day roadmap, kind of working off of Aaron Fletcher's stuff, but it was already things that we were doing. He's like, Tina, you already have this.
01:01:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You already have this.
01:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, But we don't have it written down. Anyway, Dan is one of my biggest fans who's never made a testimony.
01:01:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's like, I'm not that dude. I'm like, I know it's okay. I was just curious, it's kind of a big deal, too, the 90-day goal setting, creating a 90-day plan. 90. And the other thing that intrigued me is the scaling your business is hot, as you know right now. Hot trend, hot words over productivity, but the productivity time is powerful, but often is the vitamin that you put into the program, and I know you know these things, but... Yeah.
01:02:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm-hmm. Sell them what they want.
01:02:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Give them what they need. Yeah.
01:02:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
them painkillers because that's what they want.
01:02:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Give them vitamins. Yeah. So, yeah, cause I know a friend of mine just bought someone's course and she's going to stop the monthly because it was like no contracts. It was like 300 bucks a month. But she's intrigued by it because the promise was, you know, get a hundred K months. Line with your heart and stuff. But once you got in, she kind of, cause she's already, already wasn't Taki Moore's black belt program. I'll go because a lot of it was all just that. But the interesting part is that he sold her what she wanted. The hundred K and result goal. But once you got in, a lot of it was, which is just important, but she already knew it. As a line in your, your business around the life that you want, run your values so that you don't create a monster of a business that you want out of. That's all synopsis, right? But he led with the hundred K months, but. Yeah. once the 90 day roadmap or something that's always really hot even when I do surveys to people.
01:03:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes so this this the thing is I usually custom customize this them for people and the other biggest problem is that usually this 30 days ends up being 90 days this 30 days ends up being 90 days this 30 days ends up being it depends on the person and how much they show up but generally really there's a whole lot of resistance that happens in here a whole lot of um executive dysfunction yeah I know I need to define this I know I need to crunch the numbers I know I need to ask myself these questions but what happens is is they think about everything that's attached to that question of why am I here after I've been doing this for 10 years they start asking themselves other questions which overwhelm them depress them cause them anxiety and make them want to bury their heads so they do don't do this until they get back on the call and I drag it out of them on a call which is one of the reasons a lot of this stuff doesn't work without coaching because the thing that's stopping you is your own mental stuff and there's nobody there to extract you from your stuff and your stuff from you. It's a huge part of the work and if somebody doesn't have the mental fortitude to do that on their own they're going to continue to spin their wheels until they get somebody to help them. Yeah. That's what's hard and nobody wants to hear that but there's enough people I can sell this to who have been doing this enough that they know that they're in their own way. Yeah. And that they know there is no diet pill that actually will give you the body that you want. Yeah. have to do diet, you have to do exercise. I only want to talk to people who are not trying to buy lottery tickets.
01:05:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
diet pills anymore. There's a lot of tickets and diet pills. You haven't got where you need to be to talk to me. I've already got them for you as well.
01:05:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I stay it all the time.
01:05:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. I get some diet.
01:05:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, right? You want the easy way to riches, you want the easy way to health and it doesn't exist. Now, there is an optimized way, there's a leveraged way, but there is not an easy way. Simple, not easy.
01:05:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
How does this phrase resonate with you?
01:05:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Leveraged I recall it leveraged abundance because riches to me puts a very specific connotation of money. I also don't want to deal with FTC, but abundance is a whole different kind of thing. When I think about even the. for I had a lot of money, I had a lot of wealth, the kind of freedom I had over my life and the relationships I had with my kids, with myself, with God, with my, that was, that was exceptional, even then. It led to the money. So leveraged, leveraged abundance or leveraged wealth, even.
01:06:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But yeah, I like abundance. I like wealth. Don't get me wrong, but there's already, I'm trying to sort of kind of also as you're talking, think of how you can be a category of one as well, like from a branding perspective. Yeah, because in these videos too, like, like typically after the I've been, you know, I've helped create, you know, multi-million dollar companies or sold company in 18 months for a million dollars. Like, I'd say some accolades, right and for you and then you can create.
01:07:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think I can help you with this. I don't know anyone else that was a single mom of four kids who works less than 20 hours a week making six figures growing million dollar businesses for my clients and still having time to coach soccer. I've never met anybody else that could do that.
01:07:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So so so you're you're yeah like you could be known as that I like that yeah that would be it and then also maybe like you're you're known as like leveraged abundance is sort of the portfolio of products that you have or something. I was just trying to think of it.
01:07:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Abundance has its connotation to you. It is what my stressed out anymore. I had one question. client who showed up and he went to all these masterminds and he spent so much money. And he's he's in the guru network. And he's like, I always show up to calls ready to be beat up and I'm intimidated and I'm anxious. And he says, I just feel you love love. Now I beat him up. Yeah, beat him up. I called him out every time I said that , you shouldn't do this that you should not be doing that. No, you should do not. He's like that hurts. He goes but I still feel love and I feel anxious. And and he had peace and he told me that I made him a better father and a better husband.
01:08:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But I was here for work in business.
01:08:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And there's video on my wall somewhere about it that that he left me. And and when my dad's are like, I'm picking up my kids and I'm taking naps and I'm less it's less stress. They're happier. They're less stressful. They're busy. this are growing, I really have, know, people will say, double your income, cut your time in half. I've done that with people over and over again, but that's not the best part. The best part is they were happier, they were less stressed, they liked who they were working with. And so the thing that I tell people is, where do I have it? But it's, I have to sustainable growth and the business that you love. Where the heck? I have an Etsy store too, so I'm good. That's my fun thing. That'll do it right there, I think. Maximized profits, streamline operations, love your business. That's the big thing right there. Whoa, not going to be happy. If you're stressed, you're not going to be happy. If you're broke, you're not going to be happy. If you're hustling and grinding and chasing everything, you can't be unless you're leveraged and optimized. You're not going to love your business. Most people don't love their business. I do.
01:10:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would do this for free if I didn't need money.
01:10:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I still do it. I've done it. I do it for free.
01:10:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've got clients I work for for free.
01:10:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, that I've worked with for over a year, because that's how much I love what I do. And that's also very unique. Not a lot of people can say that.
01:10:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
01:10:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, I don't know what the hook is. I've never known what it is. So many times people try to tell me, ask me, Tina, tell me what you do. I'm like, I do so many different things. It's really more relative to you, which is not a great answer. So to tell you what I have to do, I have to know what you do.
01:10:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I could tell you what it would be helpful, blah, blah, blah, blah, Got you, got you, got you. That's where I started. I go, Maria, no, but I do like all the thoughts, leverage and optimize happy leaders, double your income time and half. Yeah, because, because when you show me that spreadsheet earlier, like the, the other one with the financial performance and stuff, seven dollar to a Facebook ads, like a productivity kind of product working that well, you know, unless I'm just having to.
01:11:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't really think Facebook is the place for me. think you too. And talk would probably be ideal. And I think that whatever I do on one, I'll duplicate on the other, maybe with a tiny tweak, according to that platform and probably Instagram because they're very similar. But my priority would be to talk in YouTube because I think that they have the most leverage compensation opportunity. I think that my personality will do very well on both of those platforms to get people to help me come out of my shell enough to do it. I've really struggled with that because I'm making claims and I am very private and YouTube is not private.
01:12:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All your neighbors see everything.
01:12:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This has been a very separate world from the rest of my life. Nobody knows what I do. There's been a lot of resistance to that, but anyway, I think YouTube and TikTok have a lot of these types of things, actually, and I think that they could do very well. I think at least the first two could do really well. I think the group membership from what I've been seeing, I don't know about that price point, but the great thing is about this, so suggest change to something and let me show you, it's a formula.
01:13:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Our offer, we've been doing really well with filling out $3, and then you'll end up getting 20% conversion rate. It's a change of $3 to $20, which is insane.
01:13:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so look how fast that changed, but let's reduce these then. Let's change this to $67, instead of $9.97, and that's still a very healthy margin. And let's just say nobody bought that.
01:13:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And the 20 should become 17 if that were to be an order bump, because we've tested 19, 20 versus 17, 17, magic number. think it's because 17 plus three is 20. So when people see that, they're okay with 20, but they're not okay with 22. That's weird.
01:13:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I think groups do better when there's a ton of people in there. And if I have to hire help, I'm really good at hiring. I have a whole huge talent pool I could tap into, and if it's making that amount of money, I get multiple people. to come in and help because a huge part of what I want to do, Mariette, give more jobs.
01:14:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I want to be a job creator for women.
01:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anything else that you would play around with in here?
01:14:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So the book, Digital PDF, that is $20 price per unit.
01:14:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Change that to $17.
01:14:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then is that going to be like an order bump in a funnel?
01:14:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that what your vision is? go ahead.
01:14:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Change the conversion rate from 17% to 45%. That's what we're getting right now in our $3 funnel. Conversion rate on the three buck offers between 20 and 30%.
01:14:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm being conservative. How many eyeballs are you getting on these offers?
01:14:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let me share a screen.
01:14:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, you OK?
01:15:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Questions? Yeah. Because we're using with like Facebook ads, so it's often hard to scale. Do you follow Maria Wentz stuff, by the way?
01:15:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like I know the name.
01:15:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, she says a lot of low ticket stuff, having the catalog model, right? Seers catalog game on catalog, you know? But she came up with this. I'm not buying it, but I always see what people are offering and the business coach on Demento, but it's all sheets, level one, level two. What custom business advice on what you should be doing based on what you want. Here's your input, calculate your monthly sales goal, cost the business coach on the mail, spit out custom checklists for you. Like I was like, holy cow. And then she's linking, I think, to the actual thing. she's charged with January seven, but again, I'm not going to buy, I'm just curious. She's always launching some interesting thing, but see level one, getting your first 1k, level two, your first 5k.
01:15:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
thought that was brilliant. I've never seen anyone do that. Yeah.
01:15:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've not seen that either. Yeah, I'll show you the link and it's funny because. years ago, I was thinking of, oh, you know, when someone buys our product, I should have three different levels that, okay, level one, go here to this training level two, but yeah, and that's something I've been trying to figure out, like, how do I segment because all of these are universal for everybody, but they are applied differently when you're in a different place. Yeah, yeah, I love that. So there, so I just I just shot that over to you there in the zoom chat, but yeah, let me log in to click funnels. So because I want to bring up the stats specifically for the three dollar thing. Now our account will never show the stats for the high ticket stuff or 500 stuff because that's through directly through Stripe. And so, whoops, well, I'll drop sets there so you can see here as well. Okay, slow to me. comes up and okay so let's we're just gonna go just go back here for example my filter so that's going take a while so let me just pull up another click button let me pull up the the thing we just launched last week and we're slowly scaling it this is the three-dollar one that surprised us because we're getting like like crazy um conversions on it remember 29 I can't remember whether we launched it on the 28th front after the 30th so I'll just go here my filter so this one's now so this we're going to push the system i.o. maybe because click panels keeps Come here. So, well, I'll just show this to you. So, this is just like a week or like maybe six days of running some ads. And again, it's not including if they buy the $500 thing or they call them by 4,800 high ticket thing. But anyways, this is showing 275 unique people coming to the page. So, I know it's not a lot right now. It's been running for like six days. The option rate click phones is showing clearly wrong stats because I can't believe it up 92%. But we were running at 80%, which was crazy. That's like the initiate checkout. Because again, it's only $3.
01:18:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:18:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
what's is that 73 people bought. So 73 divided by like say take the 229 number, it's showing 31%. So that's insane because when I come over here. And gosh, I wish I could just pull up a whole years here because I'll show you over 100 grand from the this funnel, and again, not including the $4,800 group coaching up sale. Let's just go to April, because to go order magnitude, this will only convert in as $20 the front end. It will only convert at 3%, you know, something around there. Come on, when it's not pre-framed with the $3 offer, like when it's the front end or what? Yeah, is a different funnel that's $2, and this is the funnel, and I'll show you what it looks like online. There we go. So this is the $3 one here. So all it is is just a simple three-minute video, simple headline, a slow headline. This one little testimonial reel, two minutes of just variety of testimonials. Oh. Just ahead. So yeah, um, and then this like We're going back to really because everyone's attention is like pulled in different directions This is like what's converting well now because you see the numbers just initial this is cool traffic. isn't warm traffic Um, so it's insane. That's everything we're buying. So we are now just playing around with the order bump so 38 of bought the order bump which was 19 we brought it down to 17. So we're having better conversions when it's 17 And then these conversions are not bad So we're happy with this even though the average order value kind of sucks when you Sort of look at it But knowing that we have a $500 thing and a $4,800 thing that we sell them within 30 days that customers Average order value blended will be a lot higher So if I just have a different idea and it I know i'm interrupting I'm going for 80d rain.
01:20:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will I've been trying I'm to hold it for a long time, like a whole 60 seconds.
01:21:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's a really long time for my brain.
01:21:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, I am annoying because this is, I'm a five-year-old in a lot of ways. I am like the kid on the playground that goes, do you want to be my friend? And like, do you want to come play with me? Um, I've never met anybody like you.
01:21:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah.
01:21:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to play with you.
01:21:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like, what if we created something together and combined our skills and knowledge and expertise?
01:21:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I don't know this thing because this wants to be worth out of me. It doesn't matter if it's a parallel and it doesn't matter if they're very similar.
01:21:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't believe in their competing because I think that the people that would be drawn to my individual energy are not the same that would be drawn to our combined energy.
01:21:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And even if they are, also, I just don't believe in competition. I don't believe that it's harmful.
01:21:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I believe in abundance.
01:21:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I believe that. the more effort we put in, the more magic we make, the more magic we use to do things in the world. But what if we just combined things and created something together, we could split the work, it could be a partnership. I don't know you. That's not appropriate.
01:22:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's not wise business.
01:22:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I just feel something very kismet, very sadistic about this. I'm getting very emotional. I really get frustrated at that. But what if you just sit and just think about that? mean, I've got another hour that we can come back, well, half an hour because I respect your time, and we've gone over.
01:22:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
took about 10 minutes making my tea and get my book, so don't worry. We'll just do another hour. the answer straight up is, yeah, I would like to seriously consider that because I think it would be fun, first of all.
01:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need fun and I need more conversations Maria and I need more women. I don't not have them. It's just not enough. Like I am trying to really fill myself up but also I'm trying to fill up other women too. Yeah. the more that you talk the more I'm just like, I, I bore you already.
01:23:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love you already.
01:23:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm just okay.
01:23:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, just real quick, just to kind of like close one. No, no, no, it's okay. So, so you can see from this, like the average hour, this is the one that starts at $20. This one only has a 2.73% conversion rate. So, but the average car value is 104. Like we have that dialed in. But this one, once we can dial it in because it's only been working for a week now. Like this is just the last two days. you can see that we've already dialed in like like the order bump is 27%. We're like a little bit higher. But but still like it's a crazy bananas conversion.
01:24:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like 32%.
01:24:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, you know, but but because the convergence so much higher, the cost per purchase on Facebook is 15 bucks. So we're breaking even the first two days, we actually made bunch of money, but I think warm traffic was there. And that's why a lot of them were buying all these upsells, downsells. But it was crazy. But anyway, to make a long story short, yeah, I think whatever the thing is that we create together, we create we charge three bucks, make a $17 order bump, and then just figure out, you know, what, what the, you know, other things we sell them to make it profitable.
01:24:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. And the other thing is that you're already showing up, you're doing the video, you're talking. The thing that I'm lacking most is the conversations in my life. And is that I don't want to sound arrogant because I actually get very cringy about this. But I can't tell you how many people were like, you should write a book, you should have a podcast, you should be on video, people need more.
01:25:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
for you.
01:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could listen to you read the phone book. It's the weirdest thing.
01:25:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know.
01:25:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
get people are drawn to me. But I in it. But I get fed from them. It's not a I gotta give everything to the world. Yeah, I need that. I can't pour from an empty cup and I'm doing a lot of pouring. And I need to be filled up. But I get filled up by serving. And I think that your personality plus your brains plus your work plus your skills would be amazing. And I think I could match you and I bet you're not matched very often.
01:25:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No. Yeah, yeah, I think I think the match was and he sort of had heart condition. So we aren't able to do a lot of stuff with us. Seven years was Carlos Navarro. He was the guy that's the chief technology officer he was for Nobel Networks. He was one of the original guys there.
01:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you may have heard his name before, but he's brilliant tech or known him and friends with them. But I haven't seen him for
01:26:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Exactly, yeah, he went he they almost recruited me, but I didn't want to move to South Korea The emotional intelligence software that we created about more than 12 years ago and Google's Eric Schmidt chairman of Google invested in it We sold that off to a Korean company that is now using it in hospitals for dementia patients And he became the CTO and moved to Korea and that was about five seven years ago because they wanted to recruit me too But I said no, I can't leave my family my parents and stuff But he didn't have serious heart issues, so he's really just Moved away from from being public the last year went back in health and he now is a little bit more in public, but yeah, he Yeah, so anyway, but yeah, that's only one match with but on that note, you're right I do have 430 call though now, but yeah, you have the link right just book again with me and yes We'll go You

Hey, hey.
00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, What's going on? When did I need my name?
00:00:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because I'm sick. Sick has got the blood drawn yesterday morning and you're just having.
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, my daughter came home sick and she got. So I've got my inhaler and been taking my silver and I already feel better but I'm still like.
00:00:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Got it.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then this morning my daughter comes in and she's flashing light in the darkness in my eyeball. And I'm like and I never say Jesus Christ and I say Jesus Christ.
00:00:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry.
00:00:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, I thought she was talking about my daughter for a minute.
00:00:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It could be a dog.
00:00:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Dog. I walk out and I smell this god-awful smell. I'd never smelled before and The dog was filming at the mouth.
00:01:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like what's going on. I'm like it's got me a skunk But it didn't smell like a skunk, but it was filling up my whole house the smell Oh God.
00:01:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it smelled like chemically and Not like a skunk, but it had to have been just a weird skunk We've had these experiences before it did permeate through the whole house if my daughter Mm-hmm up just smelling her dog. Yeah, she got sprayed right in the mouth dog So that's how I woke up and it wasn't even seven o'clock yet in the morning Yeah, so that on top of being sick and we had like body aches in my just yeah But and I feel good enough I get the job done, so Walk up and did my missionary stuff and I snuck like a shower during one of the calls because we're not on video and I muted myself and I'm like I'm just gonna listen and get my shower and right after I got out they like had a question for me so I'm like nobody knows and it's okay so so what did you do with the dog then what's happening with the dog right now she's okay okay yeah she it just had happened so she hadn't processed it and body but she had some water and she was too a lot just making that face and she's okay and I couldn't believe how much this because we have medical grade at HEPA filters throughout the house since COVID but also we all have asthma and the pollen around here is insane yeah so it did a really good job of clearing out smell pretty well and I can't believe it. leave because I prayed. I'm pretty sure miracles are just happening because the oils in the skunk are just they're pervasive. They take a long time to dissipate and go away. She didn't get a bath or anything but it's yeah it's the worst and the best skunk experience we've ever had. Worst as in how bad it was but best isn't how quickly it's it's like we still smell it but anyway she's okay she's out barking her head off right now. Oh my gosh and you're on fire yeah your pad just being like breaking it down. I watched while I was on my training for a minute because there were some because there was the board so I was like that's awesome.
00:03:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah yeah no yeah yeah I'm excited and I had a really good call this guy yesterday that's potentially more like just for me on the off offer stuff because he had a funnel builder that was doing stuff for him and that funnel builder just changes business model to not have any customers anymore and he's just gonna focus on his own offers. So he was wondering if I could take over and run ads for him and all that jazz. So I'm like, okay, cool. Yeah, let's do it. So yeah, that's kind of what's happening now is is to later on today, I told him said I want him to think I was a what do you go? Desperate of this that so he asked if I could send him just a detailed either a contract or or send him a details of what's more out of scope. That's what he'd like to learn more about. Not what's in scope. was going and so 5,000 months didn't phase him at all. So let's do it for 90 days, but obviously if you don't like it or you're You don't like it, you know, whatever, like I'm not going to hold you to the 90s, but I feel we should have that at least, but you got legs like I looked at his funnel. He just needs to optimize it. And I think it'll rock for him. And I also believe I don't know if you're like this now to I don't believe high ticket sells so well in this economy. So he needs in the real estate niche. He's a realtor. He's very successful what he does. And he's got a great book.
00:05:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think he wants to become like the next brand new chart, which I think is really cool. I don't it's the economy.
00:05:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I want to talk after that. Okay, sure. Okay, yeah, yeah, we love to talk. This is that is a podcast episode or video for us to do. So, but yeah, so he's trying to send them into a $3,500 thing. And I said, you know, honestly, if I run your shoes, I really feel you should have more 500 or 900 or 300 thing to assemble too. And I think that's going to make you 50k months easily with this funnel because the real estate niche have been in it. I'm very experienced and I even how I was there when Chris Michore just started because I was with the ad agency So, you know, saw her when she was nobody and everybody knows who she is, but she started in real estate now She teaches all things business, but uh, so anyways, um, yeah He's certainly open to that because I really feel You're setting yourself up for fail failure because then you have a sales team then you gotta deal with this and he doesn't want that He makes good money in his real estate business.
00:06:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He doesn't want to deal with that or manage people.
00:06:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So anyways Um, he's Looked like he's a yes. Uh, yeah yesterday on the phone. He and he on zoom call We energetic are really aligned the Ford for his book was written by one of his friends who's Bob Berg of the go-giver So like he's very heart centered Um, person so um, anyways, I understand he just wants to know what's in scope. What's not in scope Is it okay? I'll just craft you I told him I'd do it tomorrow, is today So once I have that then that will alleviate a lot of pressure to have five thousand Coming in for that, plus he's a fun guy to work with.
00:07:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I thought as soon as you said the price point, and for 90 days I'm like, okay, that just created the space that you need it. But it's actually because, but what you also need is you need the boon of what's been, what you've been having to deal with is the energy of it. wouldn't say it started with Carina, but it definitely maybe was probably most noticeable and painful with Carina of not being respected. That is an emotional heart pain, and you had Rudy, and I'm coming from these kinds of experiences as well. I'm speaking because I know what they feel like to not be honored, especially when you show up and give everything.
00:07:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, yeah, let me turn my box around. And this is to have some
00:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
but nickel and dime you.
00:08:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, try to be miserly with you.
00:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But say, I see your expertise at that price makes sense to me, at least like it isn't a done deal yet. But yeah, once you start dealing with people who honor you, you are your energy is completely different. You're not coming from a defensive and making space and now your creativity flows.
00:08:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Also your generosity increases because your fear can diminish because you know that there are good people out there.
00:08:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's very cathartic and releasing and powerful. But when you're already a generous person, it actually increases your generosity because somebody kind of restored your faith and humanity a little bit, you know. But something to think about. So in terms of the economy, there is just as much money as there always has been. If not more, it has shifted. There's a greater priority, but the bigger issue. is the economy of trust. The trust economy has what's been most damaged. So there are too many people stealing and promising big things. And hey, I'm so and so, and you just get my time. You get access to me, you get access to my community.
00:09:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's worth $10,000, it's not.
00:09:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need results for $10,000. So and most of these things are just, here let me throw all of this information at you, but there are a lot of gaps. It's not actionable. There, there isn't a support system where you can ask a specific question where you need to get. So for most people, they have realized, so this is the trust part, it's part of the trust is that they need, if they're going to spend that much money, it needs to get them a certain level of results. They're really, like people didn't ask this question. and have this realization that they're giving to you this week, which is I need an implementer because they realize they're not the one. So people that used to throw money away and the whole just kind of energy that you could do this throw money away and you would get something out of it doesn't exist anymore. There's a whole new market, but the market is coming in more educated realizing I can't just give five or ten thousand dollars and my life is going to change. So that's the big issue. can't there will be people who will pay money just for access, right? that's one thing that's my guy who's always told people people will pay for access and that's true. They will pay a lot of money to get into somebody's world. But that's not everybody. That's a small person and that person already knows what the value and the benefit of being in
00:11:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
in that connection is, right?
00:11:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the results, they've already calculated, they've already done that. Everybody else, which is the majority of the people need to have a tactical result, which is this thing that I can't talk myself into building, or I can't even comprehend how to build front like backwards and forwards, where I can build, but I don't know how to mark it, where I can mark it, but I don't know how to build that kind of thing that there's always one of those gaps, right? Yep. They need to have that solved. So for the person selling something, the person selling has to decide what do I want to deal with, okay? So we already know what we want to give and what we can sell and what we can offer, but there's a burden involved in fulfillment. So if the thing is we want to help realtors be better realtors. I want to help realtors be better realtors, but I just want to share with them what I know. I don't want to deal with customers. support. I don't want to deal with one on one calls. I don't want to deal with live events, right? So then you get a lower ticket thing that just says, here's what you can learn, okay? I just created a material for you. I don't have a lot to deal with it, so I'm going to give it kind of inexpensive, but I can give it over and over and over again because I know how valuable it is. So that person, you know, your guy who doesn't want to do a lot might consider that. The other thing he can consider is bringing in so maybe you create community and then you're looking for the excited kind of go-getters or the experienced person and then you deputize them and go, hey, would you be interested in being a moderator? Would you be interested in being a junior coach or whatever? And so now they build into the model, you take somebody that you acquired through the funnel to begin with to be a leader and those leaders, they're different because they're also loyal now. not like you went out and hired somebody. They found you, they already been sold and converted and they drank the Kool-Aid. So they're ideal to support your community and now you can charge a higher tier because now you can offer support but you're not doing it. You're facilitating it, you're paying for it, you've created a system that brings the leaders in, you create a system that can train the leaders so you can train your trainers but you don't actually do it. So he could be working with some high level people on occasion which helps him keep his saw sharp and just you know keeps tucked into his business and so like if the market ever just crashes he's got this other thing over here. love the market crashes he's not going to be a selling that very well. But anyway something to consider about that but I don't think so the economy is definitely bad but it's really mostly bad for people who struggle to get jobs in the first place. who, so for entrepreneurs if they're targeting broke people That was already an issue, which is Karina.
00:14:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And that's why her business. So I had put the glasses on and I prevent ice cream. Yeah, I really feel that sort of Karina in a way happened to her with her list. And that's why. Yeah, because they just weren't responding anymore. Like it was hard to get sales from the compared to a year ago. Same emails, right? So, yeah.
00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so that target matters. the people, but everything flows uphill, right? So, food chain. So if these entrepreneurs were targeting the rogue people who barely had money to begin with, who were just thrown it out because they couldn't, they're not getting paid. So these people that used to pay these people, these people aren't getting as much money. some of these people are creative and pivoting. So some of these people are getting that money. But these up here, you know, they're like having different conversations and pivoting more. So the majority of the shortage is here. The next level is here. The next level is here and so on. So the money and the money is flowing up, the shortage, but it's still there, it's still being generated and it's still being spent, it is the difference of who's targeting whom. Are you targeting people that have money or are you adjusting your offer to make it more available to them? But in addition to that, are you shifting what you're offering and support so that if you reduce your revenue, you're also reducing your burden, right? So maybe I'm still helping you, but I'm not giving you the one-on-one hand holding, because this price point doesn't allow me to do that, but I still want to lift you up and help you. Yeah.
00:15:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that make sense?
00:15:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, that's my feeling about how it's going, because there's still a lot of people just throwing money just going, yeah, no problem.
00:15:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let's go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I've evidenced by the sudden guy reached out to me, he sold his
00:16:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
company after the harmoses and so he wants to start a new funnel in the fertility nation wondering if I can help with that and they said yeah sure uh so you know we're just uh I should need to get back to them too so after we finish this call I need to go back to these people that are hanging loops what do you call it unfinished loops I would be happy to help you create your really clear and don't don't create the potential for scope creep because I don't want to see you be stressed out for your own reasons but for my selfish reasons too because then if you're stressed out then I don't get to play against myself yeah yeah yeah how must you do you mind if we a you You
00:20:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You Back hey, oh my god. She's painting the like she bugs me for food I gave her her food and then she walks away from her nose turned up Yeah, yeah Cuz she wants I put sometimes put a little bit of sliced ham on it, but I'm not gonna do that every single meal for her So she didn't like that. Yeah, she didn't eat it at lunch at two hours ago So I picked up put it back in the fridge with those cuz the wet food and expensive. It's like $4.50 for a little can of this cat food and she goes through a can of day and plus her dry food and so she turns and knows about it and so I put in the fridge and then now she was bugging me bugging me for food and so I put it back down on her when I was making my coffee and she looks at me and walks away.
00:21:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's hilarious. Is it too much cheaper than that?
00:21:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um you know it some of it is special ones on sale um that is Canadian dollars so 450 is probably 350 US or excuse me um but um I have given her tuna sometimes too but I guess with the special product a more holistic brand it has kind of more in it but the problem is she likes chicken flavored and Merlin the burnadoodles are allergic to chicken so if he gets in the cat food that's why he lifted he then gets the runs like the night two nights ago I was up three times during the night because he kept pawing at me go outside so you know it's not nearly as much of the painting you had this morning food.
00:21:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah and then I had to change their dog food um It's always like throwing up or dragging their butts across the ground and there's a lot of stuff outside that they can get into so I don't really know what's what but I was reading how much corn is in all the dog food and how bad it is to digest for any any of us really but so I got some food from Chewy that doesn't have any corn in it and they've been a lot better but yeah I can't see no little fur babies got to take care of them I know I know they are beautiful like oh no she's eating her wet her dry food so she said no to the wet food that's really expensive and the dry food is expensive nowadays too but anyways now she's stomping at that oh my god anyway um yeah so did you see my video that I did on my facebook page today I saw part of it I didn't get to see all of it but I thought that was awesome yeah and who I'm calling out now 50,000 And I'm embedding the seed, right?
00:23:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
yeah, if I come over here, so, yeah, 50k months from different parts, I'm just kind of embedding the seed. So, so, yeah, yep. All right, so I got this going. Let's go. You cool to start on this now or is that.
00:23:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, let's do it. So, I think the fastest way to start would be what do you already know that he wants to do so that what is the existing goal? Actually, that would be that's what I do is I reverse engineer every single time. What is the outcome that is desired? And then I work backwards and think about what has to happen to make that. And then I figure out what is the simplest way to accomplish that and what are the guardrails to make sure that I'm not. called out of it. If there's potentially something that could scope creep, I build that in and say, okay, if this needs to happen, you will pay for this. Maybe I'll manage it. Maybe I'll lead it, whatever. But just to be clear, if this is needed, I'm not doing it.
00:24:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. So he's got a couple outcomes desired. I'll just write them all down and then we can succinctly make it better if you want. So so the first thing is that the overall big outcome is that his avatar of and obviously this isn't going to go in a minute like this of who he wants to become is like a Brooke Castillo.
00:24:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you know Brooke Castillo? No.
00:24:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. She is the owner of owner of the life. Basically he wants to become a high-performance coach like a Tony Robbins Brooke Castillo. Okay. Or Brandon Bouchard, right? owner of life. So he wants to use the real estate RE course as a springboard to other other missions. don't know what you want to call it, but EG, he has a productivity course course. I think he'd love to have a relationship course. This is down the road like he'd like to just help people, right? His offer is called, his name's Grant Mueller.
00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know ever heard of him. He sounds very all over the board.
00:25:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, no, no. This is for long term. No, I could just go into the short term. Why call me? just you know that it's good, but it does help to have the overall thing. Yeah. So, I mean, the initial scope is basically optimizing this funnel. Also, he'd like to get to let me find the actual URL top of that yeah top of heart offer and this is converting not bad it's at 7% conversion so it actually isn't bad um he showed me the conversions but uh top of hearts he booked Bob Berg's written the four that's his friend as well but um you know as far as uh you know if we were just to go down to the real outcomes that he wants to um make a profit with this uh little ticket funnel funnel and that's called top of heart offer make a problem that's um he also said that it'd be he says i can afford the 5k right now no problem but it's coming out of my real estate business but i'd like your 5k month to be funded from this event as well. But basically, I think you'd like to get to 20k profit per month. I need to say an exact number. He kind of just said he wants to make it profitable. So let's just get rid of this.
00:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it currently like, does it lose money?
00:27:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What is that? Yeah, so the history is he hired this other guy, Vinny, to create the funnel like two, three months ago and run ads. And so the deal he had with him is that he charged in 10,000 to build the funnel and doesn't include up so one or upsell two, which is kind of like my little ticket offer. But he also runs ad for it. And because he knew that he had a $3,500 high ticket, he said, when you make your $10,000 back in sales of your high ticket, then I'll charge you $5,000 a month for continuing run ads and optimize the funnel. So Vince, a few weeks ago, decided to stop doing being an agency, um, you stopped everything. And he still likes Vince. He says, a good guy, but I have no one now, right? So the goal is to make it profitable. So he didn't really have the greatest numbers right now. And he was embarrassed about it, but said, I kind of need to know your numbers. He shared screen yesterday into his go ahead level account. That's why I knew he was converting at two at 7%. But no, he's, I don't know if he's profitable. I say no, because his average order value is probably only between seven and $10 because he had zero conversions of his order bump and zero conversions of up cell one. So I said, okay, right there, I know I can help you tremendously. So I already know you're under water because you're probably paying at least $40 cost per purchase. But I didn't want he was going to give me access to account. But I said, no, until we have a working relationship, I don't want to work, like expand my brain energy on that. But I know I can help you.
00:28:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how where is his current lead to coming from?
00:28:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's a new funnel. So paid traffic, Facebook ads.
00:29:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And what's, what's he paying? What's he getting? How many eyeballs are seeing it?
00:29:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, I don't know.
00:29:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I mean. I didn't want to look at his eyes. Okay. Okay.
00:29:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You don't know about it. Yeah. Yeah. Um, basically in the last, like, I think Monty had like 29 buyers. oh, he said he was spending 15, uh, I guess Vinny's deal with he does with people. He was spending 15, uh, $50 a day. And he's been running it for about six weeks. He said, these are all like, what happened, which I thought was kind of . But I'm not going to go into detail, slam, anyone or anything. But, um, because there's always two stories to it. Um, there was a slack channel that Vinny had with his clients that had all these numbers on it. And, uh, Vinny closed the slack account down. So, all that was gone. But still, that's up to him as the entrepreneur that he should have had a Google Sheet that showed weekly ad spend weekly So he also didn't know what he doesn't know, but he really, ideally the outcome is make this profitable, use it as a once he kind of feels he has it dialed in and knows doing like maybe launch other low ticket offers. Right now it's, you know, $7 offer. And he's got a lot of bombs and all that that I'd have to totally redo because they're not working. To a $3,500. I take it. Take it with more coaching. So, so the outcome desired is simply. Yeah, make a profit with the little take a funnel right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that that includes paying for me but I'm not going to say that in the document here. Oh, yeah.
00:30:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
let's do some quick math. which I shouldn't, I mean, basically, 5,000, 100 hours, hold on, let me do that. I thought, no, that's right. So roughly, if we were going to keep your EHR at 500, we'll, we'll make it 250, because 250 is still better than you've been doing, right? if you worked 20 hours a month for roughly five hours a week, that's roughly an hour a day. So that's I'm not saying that that's what you should do. And I don't think that you're necessarily in a situation to do that. I think you can do much better. And I think that even if you spend two hours a day for him every day, which would be 10 hours a week, which would make your effective hourly rate about $50, hold on a second, that's 5 out of 40, $125 an hour. So if you worked two hours a day, every pre-day of the week, your EHR would be about $125 an hour, which is still not bad. And I think that this is a process that you should do on a regular basis, just to kind of have an idea before you say yes, no to anything, whatever.
00:32:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And also it helps create the kind of scope.
00:32:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
in the two hours a day, there's a lot that you could do. There's a lot of research, there's a lot of copywriting, there's reporting time, there's all kinds of things that would go into. One of the things I always do for my clients, which very few people do for them, is I set up something for them and then make them owners. So I used to use base camp. Now I'm using Trello because base camp is more expensive and it's more convoluted than it used to be. And Trello is still very simple. It's just camben boards and I can invite them and then I can make them owner, where you can't do that with base camp. You can't somebody to an admin owner whatever. But that way, because you want to teach them, and this is a gift that you're giving them. to own their reporting, own their data, own their stuff, no matter who they work for. So a lot of people, and this is again kind of my leadership style and what I give to them is I teach them, delegate, don't abdicate, but most people abdicate. They say, they think, I give you my money, this is your responsibility now, no, because they don't care about your business like you do, they don't, you know, all that, anyway. So, so keeping all of these in mind, one of the things I would do is, let's say, and I would write this down, and I can, I can take some bottom notes too, but I would start with one of the things I'm going to do for you is create a project management suite there. So it's going to be a Trello board where we're going to track all of the things that are going to get done, and I'm going to task by everything so that you will be able to see what I'm doing, when it's due, or whatever is doing, if we end up hiring somebody to do something, and you will be be able to see everything that happens as it happens and you'll have a record of it moving forward. So if you want to duplicate this across another one of your products, you'll have the project mapped out that you could find what's usable and duplicated to the next one. So this is an asset I'm creating for you that you'll be able to use again and again. Because now you're value-stacking, right? not like I'm just not just getting you the money that you want. I'm creating assets and value that are going to have compounding benefits for you. But the other part of that is now you've got something that shows your work and keeps people from breathing down your neck. Well yeah but Maria didn't get me the results, I didn't get the sales, I wanted whatever. Okay well you can see Maria strategically went down through the list and your offer still didn't convert. know that because you can't make everything convert well whatever. There's a lot that goes into that. Anyway, so the next thing I would do, but I would have done this before coming into it since your job is conversion, I would have looked at the ads. And I would have looked at the ad account because just even though you know the conversion rate, you don't know how bad or good the ads are. Like if they're really good ads and he's spending $50 a day and can only get that, that's a red flag, that's an issue, that means you're going to have an uphill battle.
00:35:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, because because he doesn't have his funnel done, it's only front end funnel at seven bucks.
00:35:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yes, so that's an additional part, but if you have a hard time getting even front end sales with $50 a day, then that would be a concern that I would have, but if it was a really good ad, I doubt that that's the case, but I would have wanted at least that much information before I said yes for sure, like, at least show me one of your ads, so I know and look at it and go, yeah. There's so much opportunity.
00:36:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, he was willing to put me on the ad account, but I just, and also I've worked with him before.
00:36:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He is good at ads. almost hired him a while ago for a client for ads.
00:36:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like he's, so no, I think the ads are performing because for him to get seven percent conversion on 50 bucks a day on the fact that the funnel doesn't have any conversions on the order and no conversion upsell one. Like to me, there's so much opportunity there and just optimizing the funnel.
00:36:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, if you did one of your calculators and put in two order bumps, like, um, just next level, right? Do you, so you'd have to know what does he have that he could give in between an offer, um, between the seven and the 3500?
00:36:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Is there anything that he sells? Yeah, that's my job to figure out because he does have stuff and he gave me access to his whole drive to look at it. I said, look, we just need to create for you like a 297 product or a thousand dollar product.
00:36:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much did that, would you, have to do.
00:37:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, I don't have to create it, but what I'll do is probably will take me only hour to look at all of his existing assets, because he even said, honestly, Maria, Vinny had me create three bonuses for this similar product. And one of these bonuses, I think, could be the $297 if I just flush it out more. Nice. So yeah, it's kind of like what I did with Crena. Like, Crena had that $20 funnel, $50 average order value working with me. I increased to like $105 or more average order value. And instead of sending people to her $4,800 thing, I said, we just need to create a $1000 product. Oh, you're, she already had it. She already had it. So I said, we just need to create a decent enough sales page for it. Here's your VSL script for it. I outsourced the power graphics for it. And we also created the payment plan or 12 for 99, 12 months, and people stay in several months, and she's going to get 15%.
00:37:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, your most of your work is getting to done in the beginning. One thing I would require is a 90 day contract because you're going to spend most of your time in the beginning and not in that end. And so you kind of get cheated. And that's the thing that I would say is, okay, 5000 a month, this is a target, but it has to be a 90 day. And I would tell him because I'm going to work extra hard in the beginning. And so if you cut me out of because you're going to have to do the research, do the strategy, write the copy, create the ads, do the targeting, manage the ads, tweak the copy and the ads, according to whatever happens, create the nurturing sequence or the ascension or any of any of the follow up sequence. is in order to get people from opt-in to buying and then buying to upsell and so on until they've exhausted all of that. You know you're going to look at his email deliverability because you're not going to want him using email and then you're not touching it. I imagine you would anyway, I can't imagine you're not taking a peek at that and making a suggestion, right? So your mental energy is going there. there's probably going to be some graphics that need to be created in order to support the ad campaign, the landing pages, things like that. And the sequences, now we're talking about automations to an extent. It may be minor and it may be just people consider that part of the job, but it's still your knowledge and expertise.
00:39:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is a lot that's happening.
00:39:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So technically you're doing like three people's jobs. So well, four. So the media buyer, the copywriter, the graphic designer, and the automation expert, those are for roles that if you have a decent team, you're going to have those four roles are going to be different people, and you're doing all of it. So the other thing that you might build in is say, okay, if I get you to X point, then I get a performance bonus. And I will have earned it.
00:40:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Right. I know my friend Kira, and she's this is how she dealt with student McLaren and another gal that she's now running huge ads for the dinner clients for three years. She started out at 2500 a month plus 10% of ads. And now she's at, I think, 3000 month, the 10% of ads, but she makes 30,000 month for me client. because she grew, she's so good at what she does. Actually, I trained her that, um, you know, she, she got them to be able to profitably scale ads.
00:41:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you need to include that in your pedigree. Yeah, I'm in the notes.
00:41:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What's her name? Cara. Sure.
00:41:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She probably wouldn't want she. No, no, you don't have to tell her name. Yeah, I was gonna say her name. No, I don't like telling people's names. I, I'm not going to do that in myself. I'll describe the company because it just feels not good. You know, I don't want people talking about my business. My business is my business and I don't do other people. Um, but, but I want you to tell that story. So Cara, I'm going to put this in a highlight as a task that add that to your thing that you train somebody that does this. Like that's part of your pedigree.
00:41:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, there's a few, Kimmy is the same. She's making a killing and she was my practice for a few years.
00:41:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. but does she do all of these things that you would be doing or does she?
00:41:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, she, she, she, She just does the ads because these people have a team, Stu McClellan has a copywriter, he has a copywriter, but what I could do, I could tell them the graphics design cost is out of scope. I could say I know what I want from the graphic design, but I could say that's out of scope, that the cost of outsourcing graphic design elements. And it's not going to be much, but still, know, it could be 100 to 200, don't you think I figure, right?
00:42:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. It depends on what you need. if you're creating, if you're creating a pretty PDF, that takes a lot more time and energy, even for one of my Filipinos, like I might pay $100 just for that, just for the PDF. But then to get the 3D images and what might be $25. So those parts are not that expensive. But when you, when you are creating a new e-book, the PDF itself targets, it's expensive. So the graphics, not so bad. content that needs to be beautified. That's a little bit more expensive.
00:43:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Beautiful. Yeah, because the book's not really beautified.
00:43:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, but in the presentation matters. Like if I give you a piece of chocolate cake, have I told you this example before? No, tell me.
00:43:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If I give you a brand new company, Tina, I'll talk to you girl.
00:43:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I actually learned this in terms about presenting the gospel.
00:43:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It was funny, but it has universal applications.
00:43:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Presentation matters. So if you see me go cut a slice of a beautiful bakery cake, and I put it on a lovely elegant plate and hand it to you with a fork and a napkin, you know, that's one presentation. Now if I throw it on a paper plate, give it to you with a plastic fork. That's another level, but it feels a little bit different. It feels more elegant when you give it to me with all of that, you know, and it feels special. And but then if you give it to me on a paper plate with a fork, I'm just like, it's delicious, dig in, you know, I'm still here. Now, if you scoop it out with your hand and you put it in my hand, I'm like, I don't think I want it. And if you take tape cake and you throw it on the floor and then you pick it up and give it to me, I'm like, you crazy, go away. Right. it's the same. If you eat it other than the dirty part, it's the same, but how you present it matters. So our content, especially when you're talking about like ADHD, executive dysfunction, and also just depression and anxiety, based on color psychology, we know that colors have energy and they evoke emotion. So if you've just got a plain ugly thing, the emotion, you're not, you're not optimizing the emotion. But if you can create it in colors that create warmth and trust, so like blues and yellows and greens and oranges, that's why. If you look at the biggest brands, almost all of them use blue. Look everywhere. Any kind of thing. There is blue. Google uses it. You go look in your bathroom, go look at the biggest brand names that you buy. There is blue all over them. Because blue is trust. So green is travel, oranges, action, black is luxury, red is luxury also. But anyway, all these kinds of things, yellow is calming, but also trust. blue and yellow are used a lot. Anyway, but then if you like, if you have large chunks of text and it's small text versus the parallax type of design, right, and images. broken up through here so that the eye flows left to right and it's not glorious because or let's say they want to go back to a piece of content and they lost their place for a second and now they got to go through this chunk of text but but that chunk of text they wanted was right next to this particular image and they can find it easy. Most people aren't thinking about this the mental effort that people have to go through to consume their content. Yeah this makes a big impact because how can they be raving fans if they never consumed your stuff. So anyway this is something that again you you can just bring to the mix and you make beautiful images and you do this naturally but most people don't.
00:46:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know it's true whenever I've hired someone to help with graphic design Tina I'm just like oh you really suck at colors.
00:46:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can do this better.
00:46:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah like like like that's what I'd say to people like Sally lover and she's been a client of mine for for 15 years in customer mind. Cara, by the way, too, she was one of my first testimonials 10, 12 years ago. you know, now she's doing rocking, rocking it. yeah, when they put stuff together, I'm just like, oh, that's like, come on, girl, let's fix this up.
00:47:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have so much to bring to the table.
00:47:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry. I know, I know I'm excited about that. So, so, yeah, okay. So, so, so I've got a lot in here. This is a lot of stuff in here. Um, do you want to just want to lock it down?
00:47:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am here for whatever and you can tap me down. I get excited about everything. I'm the same way in Sunday school.
00:47:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So you can just be like, Tino can wait.
00:47:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, should I include the longterm outcome or no, that you said, I do. So, but I break things up and stages. So I'll give the full vision because I want them to see that I can see this and I want to get excited about it. And if I like working with them, I want to stay with them. So I'm going to draw the whole picture out. But I won't scare them with a commitment of, you know, you don't have to we don't have to do all that together. I can start with just this, but I want you to see that this is what I see that we could be working on.
00:48:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, so, so how do I quantify or say the full vision? just said, you know, Brooke is there. So yeah, actually I'm like coach certified by her lover. And I think she scaled too fast, though. And I know she's having some issues. But he said that that's I just love her thought model. I love what she does for people, helping them be better you and stuff. And that's what I eventually want to be in. He has, I noticed in some of this stuff in his book that I started reading, he has talked about high performance like himself. This is his first email that sucks, by the way, but this is the book. And you're right, the, the, the, this is not bad top of heart. I got my attention, I saw that. But he definitely is kind of talking about himself as more of a peak performance person, how to approach your business, save my life. I think I save yours too. We talked about how he almost died because he was a mathematics and a dealer. So I've only read the first quarter of it last night and it was interesting. It did hook me. But yeah, I think he could make this better. This is because I think it was on Amazon. think it's kind of like this because it was a written book as well.
00:49:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, what I would do too and what I want to do with everybody that I work with where I'm any kind of operator is I need to know what the values are but I need to know the overarching value. What is the most important thing? So why does he want to be like Tony Robbins? Does he want to be hero worshiped or does he want to help as many people as he can? Now, he's not going to tell you he wants to be hero worship. Your job is to pay attention then to figure out if he's congruent or not. And here's what you need to understand also if he was a meth addict, he has an addictive personality. Addicted personality means he needs that dopamine hit and he can get that from hero worship. So those are red flags that you have to watch out for is that they need a drug and that can get in the way and that can cause them to sabotage business. So you don't have to fix all that you just need to be aware of it and so but but what you can start with so look at that and you know there's love that he is feeding off the energy that is his drug and it's okay because we all have our stuff but you just you just want to know that you understand why he's all over the but board is because he's chasing dopamine he's chasing his hit. So if you can in managing the business provide the hits. right? Then then he's going to be happy. Whether he can speak it or not, what he needs is to feel feel that that energy coming back to him. So if we could go back to your document?
00:51:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yep. I just lay that down chasing dopamine.
00:51:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:51:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All right. There it is.
00:51:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. So, um, there is like, what did Tony Robbins do before he became Tony Robbins? then the Tony Robbins we know now is not the Tony Robbins we knew 10 years ago, 20 years ago, whatever. Now he's doing stuff with his wife and leading women. And so one of the things you want to do is put things in perspective as to where he has now, where he was five years ago, where he wants to be. And to know that there is a pace that you can influence.
00:51:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
if you try to force it, you're going to break things.
00:51:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So this is why I talk about sustain up growth. And people that are that have addictive personalities, which I would say that I do, but I've worked on that a long time and didn't very conscious of it. So I didn't make me get a crowding it.
00:52:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Was that me too probably as well?
00:52:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:52:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that me?
00:52:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
kind of lost my train of thought. But anyway, it was that they'll sabotage things by if they're not filling what they need to do. So you kind of need to help crowd them. And so chunking things out so full vision is just kind of building out what the process is. So we could say, okay, you're here. Here's where you want to be, you know, Tony Robbins level. So one of the things that I would ask him, which is way beyond the scope of support, but it will help you knock this out of the park. If you want to. Um, would be, what is it about Tony Robbins and Brooke that you specifically want to have? Is there anything about them that you're not interested in having in their business? And I would describe, I would have them describe, you know, what does that day look like? does that, that year look like the year in the life of, um, grants?
00:53:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, Tony, do me ask him that messenger right now?
00:53:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not yet. I'll send you these notes so you can go do that later. Um, so then you could say, all right. Well, we know that we can't get there by the end of this year, but maybe we could get there in the end of five years. But in the meantime, you need this to be profitable. And then you want to build out the next offer and the next offer, right? So, we would say the first, you know, six to nine months, our job is to build out, um, is to optimize. This particular offer and do it so well that when you get to creating the next offer that we've got the system down and we can basically replicate it for your next offer. So you're priming him to and that's in a sum to close. We're going to be working together nine months from now. If you want it, right? And that's not manipulation. It's just what I've noticed after the fact. I always operated like that. And then somebody told me, I like your sons of clothes. I'm like, what? What is that? I didn't know. It wasn't a technique. It was just me being me.
00:54:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was just like, well, of course, like, why would I not think about it that way?
00:54:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So basically six, nine months build out this offer to profits and do it so well, we'll replicate it for other niches you mentioned productivity relationships. Yes, but immediately after you say that, you're going go now, don't think that I mean it's going to take nine months to profit. I mean that we've matured it to the point that we can now replicate it to the next product. So now you break out the timeline for making this profitable. So me knowing you, I think within the next 30 days, you will have mapped out two order bumps, created the sales pages, landing pages, and ads, whatever necessary for those order bumps.
00:55:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
One order bump and then optimize, just because I don't know if go high level has the ability to order bumps.
00:55:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't want to get into technology. Okay. So, yeah, that's a technical language as to how it works, but you know what I mean? think is really what we call it differently. order bump, cell one, there we go, which I always think is not about just dropping the price. Hey, if you didn't like it, that price, here's another one, because that sounds out of integrity. But if you didn't like that, here's a smaller version of it at a lower price. Anyway, so in 30 days, all of that should be mapped out and live. Now, they might balk and think that that's not fast enough. But there's a lot that goes into getting that done correctly. And he's going to have to create more ourselves. So we want to make sure that that happens. 30 to 60 days, then, from day 30 to day 60, is we're observing and potentially, by the way, at the end of 30 days, also having a split test mapped out for headlines or call to action or price, but not all of the above for each of the things that we have going on. So one split test. for every landing page mapped out an on deck for live by the end of 30 days. That's a total agency because everything you're telling me now if I had you five years ago we'd be 50 million a year. I did actually and incredibly fast. It's Arthur Tubman and yeah and and then he ruined it by overselling and pissed me off and I quit and then he got a divorce and yeah and he was also a drug addict. Got it. Recovering. Yeah I do know what I'm doing actually. Yeah I'm scaling agencies but but I also know they're the biggest reason I have most of the guardrails I have is because this is a very difficult model and the clients that you take are make or break because most of them are high pressure and if you get these people who have these arbitrary goals and they're They throw a ton of money at an agency and the agency says yes when they shouldn't have because the client was out of integrity Trying to 10x and it just destroys everybody along the way And yeah, okay, so can we scroll back down when you're when you're ready? Okay, so matter of fact, I have phases mapped out I don't even remember what they are, but I know what I would make and I have all these phases for growing the agency But day 30 to 60 is just monitoring optimization and it's more split testing Split testing the abs again headlines call to action and images Sometimes price point kind of just depends on what's happening but Um The thing about split tests, which I know you know is that you have to have a certain amount of conversions before you can declare a winner, so that requires the amount of volume to be happening. And so people will be like, well, okay, did it win or did it not win? You can't force the declaration of a winning split test until you have volume period, because you want to be confident that you know, and it takes roughly 100 conversions to have some certainty. And that depends on how big the gap is anyway, on the split test. Today 30 to day 60 is optimizing and seeing how it's doing. And it's also getting some customer feedback. And it's filling the holes. So something probably got missed, maybe on an automation level, maybe a pixels not firing, maybe the data is not reporting correctly. But it's fixing anything that got broken during the first phase of 30 days, while we were building something always goes wrong, it needs to be fixed and handled and that takes time.
01:00:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
One thing is that if Karina, that's working really well, mean put this as a post and nothing held back as just value add. The VA, I told her to hire from online jobs.ph, I told her to look at hiring someone with higher IQ because we're service and so this person is not a setter that calls to like, what could call the person was just simply texting and messaging the buyers to, hey, did you get your purchase? I gave you simple process of that, because of that good will or good karma, then those people are more likely to buy other stuff from that map. Then what she also did, because we've been running ads for so long, went back to all the old ads, the actual posts, like within the Facebook ads ID, the actual posts, because she messaged the VA, messaged every single person commenting, hey, just wondering if you're still looking for this did you get value from this did you and then from that that increased like she's making about 10k now a month in sales organically for that for an $800 person and but the reason why we had that asset she's running ads for two years right and so you should put that in 60 in the 60 to 90 days slot so coffee shop millionaire how to click bank penalizes you when you have too high of household and so they got penalized big time and all that I implemented was zendesque and an FAQ section and we dropped it down to less than 2%.
01:01:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
38 reduction in refunds by having good customer support so yours is actually proactive support rather than reactive right and in that went to there's a saying in sports that the best off best defense is a good offense you don't even need a defense, if your offense is so good that you're always on their side of the field and not on yours, right? So what you did was you had a great offense, right? You're going out so hard that you're actually converting them to the next level of sales. There doesn't even come up an issue of customer support.
01:02:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This just happens probably in the same conversation. You don't think we can add an FAQ section like in between day 30 to 60?
01:02:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think you should. I think the whole point of creating this scope is not overdoing it. This is a lot of mental work. They, oh, yeah, they zero to 30. Sorry, 30 to 60. You could be starting to do this. Yes. But you, maybe you have the VA do it. So if you do out of scope of support is outsourced VA, then you delegate the VA to start capturing frequently asked questions. As long as you're not doing it, that's okay.
01:03:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, here, start capturing.
01:03:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, 60 to 90, not 0 to 30, or I mean 30 to 60, 30 to 60 is okay, but not before that. I'd probably have that more at 60 to 90 because we don't want to overwork your brain. There's a lot of data to process in 0 to 30 and 30 to 60. Less than 30 to 60, but now 60 to 90, to me, that's optimization, which FAQs and customer support to me is in the optimization realm, but it could be considered fulfillment. So 60 to 90, I mean 30 to 60, it could be in there. It depends on what you want to do and how zealous you feel about it.
01:03:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was thinking it was my funnel. I would want to start maybe in a section.
01:03:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And I. I like the golden rule methodology of things.
01:04:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If I were doing it, if it was my business, this is what I would do. How about refine?
01:04:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So that is an ongoing process. It should always continue to be refined. And also, what I would be doing in that portion is looking at how do we use AI to improve it?
01:04:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Cool.
01:04:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And as far as you going, any services that you offer, knowing what is AI tools and staying on top of that technology to know what can be used to scrape and automate those questions, and because it has the ability to say, somebody asked this question, and this verbiage is different, but it's pretty much the same question. So I'm going to count that as a number. That didn't exist a few years ago, and it does now, so we could create. Additionally, building in here a chatbot for sales and support, 60 to 90 days, or you know now we're getting into phase two of just kind of optimizing and growing scale.
01:05:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Any eye chatbot?
01:05:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:05:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But that's out of scope of the 5000 month, isn't it?
01:05:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, so that could be the next 90 days. And you could say, now this is above and beyond creating and optimization, but this is optimized in scale. first 90 days is create, establish and grow. And second 90 days could be like grow and optimize, optimize, grow, whatever. And then I don't even know you want to put grip, but the third phase is just maintenance and scale. scaling, which seems like they're not the same thing, but when people neglect maintenance and they focus on scaling, then there's problems.
01:06:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, so we try to, day zero 30 is phase one, optimize and grow?
01:06:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nope, day, phase one is 90 days. So that's why the whole point of the long term view, like we have six to nine months. Six to nine months allows for the three phases. the first phase is just really creation. The second phase is optimization and the third phase is scaling. And the third phase is the third 90 days.
01:06:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, day 90 to like next 90 days. Yeah. Phase two.
01:07:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
01:07:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Is it you just call it optimization or scale?
01:07:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Optimizing and preparation for scale. Prepare for So the first thing that you do is look at, you know, maintaining anything from phase one, anything created in phase one. And then now you're going to look for what are...
01:07:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hold on. Let me just hit pause for second. a comment here, but it's one.
01:07:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll hear you.
01:07:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I got about 20 more minutes. But this is for them.
01:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like what you're we could so many days we'll average I'm excited because I have so much stuff in my brain that I would love to teach and love to get well to use but I won't do it by myself Maria so yeah you're capturing a lot of stuff yeah sorry yeah we can sell this as a consulting kit because everyone wants to start an agency make a current revenue can go high level like this we could totally certified people in this and sell it and we've got the notes from every call okay so phase two is we're maintaining everything that was created in in phase one including the split test process right in the customer support process but most of what phase two is it's continuing to optimize right so understanding our split test results and improving them but the other thing is before we get to scale is where have we left money on the table is there a compliment Mentory or supplementary offer we didn't put out there that we should have that we're getting the feedback from our customers Right so if somebody through the FAQ is in the customer support I said, you know what I have this knowledge this gap this gap in knowledge And it's not being addressed here. How do I get this addressed or? I want more hand-holding. How do I get more hand-holding? or Okay, well you taught me how to do all of these things, but I don't know how to outsource it You're not teaching me how to outsource it. Can you teach me how to outsource? now we create an outsourcing product. So the next 90 days is learning from our customers what we could do better and How do we increase the lifetime value of the customer and but also the average order value? You So, that's it, that's it, that's it, it's just massage everything and make it as good as we can. Phase three is scale and it's, you need to look at the pace of scale and the cost of scale. Is that your mama?
01:10:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Amanda.
01:10:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I should just cut back. Okay. Tell me about Amanda. Yes, bye. Yeah. Anyway, so I saw you smiling in the earbuds or so. Anyway. Um, so scale is first, you have to create the strategy for scale. Right. So that's a long discussion. That's not a one off conversation. That's not a one off meeting. That's a whole process. And here's why you doing everything in Trello for them is so important, is because you will have kind of an inventory of what it took to get to where you're doing and what it's taking to manage the current business, right? So you know how many people it takes to fulfill, and hopefully by phase two we've learned how to fulfill well what we're currently fulfilling. So if we were to two X thoughts or three or four X that, what would it take in fulfillment and who's running it and who's leaning it and who's managing it? So how much high-level mental power and energy and leadership is that taking? And can we do that with the existing people? Can we two X with our existing team? Can we four X with our existing team if we can, then we just go through that process. Keeping in mind and making sure that our content. I understand that you can't just go, especially with Facebook and I don't know about other platforms, but especially with Facebook, you can't just go double your ad spend and they double you get a lot of the times that backfires you immediately your ad spend and all of a sudden you're losing the leads that you get it makes zero sense, but I've seen it happen repeatedly.
01:12:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I think this one is more look at other profit sources as well.
01:12:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, but that's really to me that was happening in phase two.
01:12:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Phase two, oh, okay, but no, yeah, I mean, maybe, no, no, no, okay, so phase two, we need to profit sources.
01:12:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was thinking about this right complimentary products that were missing, but you're talking about channels.
01:12:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no hidden money. Yeah, I was thinking about complimentary products, but scale here is like expand other marketing channels.
01:12:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, add channels. Okay, got it.
01:12:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I totally agree with that.
01:12:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay. So how can we replicate our marketing across channels? You know what, if we map this out really well, and then we go get Maui or somebody to make this into a beautiful PDF or slideshows, and then you're presenting this to your clients. Oh my gosh, like a pitch deck. Girl, kind of like just close it.
01:13:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah, like, because, you know, ages ago, when I worked as a strategy, chief strategy person for the, we see what's her name, Emily Hirsch. I actually created for her because she just had a document like that. I said, you know, if you want to close more clients, because I learned that from work for the big consulting firms, we need graphics, right? So we would, I'm just showing you, we would make of these kind of sales projection graphics. See that within sense, they send conversions. And then we would make, let's see.
01:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know what I want now. What do you want? I want to work in companies like you with you. All the things that I've been doing. I want you to be the CMO. I want to be the COO. But I just want to have the teams. only want to have one or two meetings a week.
01:14:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Everybody do their stuff.
01:14:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I love using my brain.
01:14:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So I created this on paper and then I hired someone on fiber to put it in digital format. But like, so we could mimic this because it's so beautiful. Mimic this with what you just talked about. Yes. Three phases.
01:14:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, we are magic together.
01:14:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We are. thing is, he's expecting the proposal today, though. So I think I need to give it to him word format, just so he has it because I told him I'd give it to him. And he really wants to know what's out of scope. But I think I have enough from you right now, but I agree.
01:15:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think eventually we make a pitch deck like this That's what this is right.
01:15:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, this is actually the guy that does the guy her Lee So let's use the guy that on the MacGyver show. He's the writer for MacGyver. That's amazing. This guy.
01:15:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah Here's what I think I know you have to go in a few minutes if you close this guy Yes, then and I'm happy to spend any of our time during the week just helping you Mm-hmm. you don't need help But if we can speed it up so that we can get to some of this stuff together then then again I'm always looking out for me. I'll be honest But what I would love then to do is is take what's happening there because so You know how to go make all the money But what you can see is a light outline the operation and it immediately comes out of my brain like it doesn't take any time Next step, next step, next step, I can go hire the people, I can bring them in, train, insert, whatever. But anyway, if we take all of this stuff in our, in whatever free time is available, and now you've got enough money and you'll be okay, then let's go pitch a client or two max. But they got to be doing 50,000, I would rather see them doing 100,000 a month with roughly 40% profit margins, and they want a COO and a CMO who work together, who will take everything top to bottom and execute it. And we put out killer, like we just put out a few skills that show what we do, and we just wait until somebody takes us up on it, because your money's coming in enough, mine's coming in enough, and we'll wait until the perfect match comes in, and then we get to play together and build this, and then get testimonials from that. So it's a slow pace, but it means we're not For you mean or replicate to other nope, so I call it face so face three and beyond The face three and you're kind of always in face three every product or Like I don't know what you would call it offer every Product offer type Once you get to phase three, is no additional phase. That's it's to infinity because that's scale Unless base four would be selling mean exit the business.
01:18:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
mean yes, God, got Well, did you say before like what was initially face three and Replicate based on it's just scaling and until you can't scale anymore or you want to sell and exit So for for this, that's it For one product market offer type whatever that's this is it It's just continuing
01:19:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
no optimization, sell the offer, sell the business, it both they're there, they can be separate because sometimes, you know, you, you can sell something off piece by piece. So, but then, so what I would do beyond this is go, um, uh, so that's step one of getting towards the Brooke business, right? After phase three, step two, so this is not a phase, but this is, this is a step on the mission, right? Um, um, is launch the next product. And I don't know how that fits into her model, because I don't know anything about her.
01:19:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Does she have all these different types of products? Does have now and she has lot of coaches underneath her and stuff, so she has a 25 case certification, but she stopped it all that. I won't go into detail now because I think I'm ready to send this to him because I know he's expecting it. Um, I have to go for massage and
01:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like 20 minutes.
01:20:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
terrible. I know, yeah. So, so, but, um, so in scope, I can just keep us assets. creating for you assets.
01:20:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I really like bullets too.
01:20:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think bullets just help the eyes. My problem is that I don't know Google sheets that well, so you want to do bullets to ads?
01:20:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so it's just line breaks and then highlighting it. What do you mean? Let's do this under assets. Yeah, essentially. I was gonna say, if you could share it, I'll just do it for you real quick. But, um, okay.
01:20:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm happy to help. It is. Copy link.
01:20:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, um, can you do T net profit drivers? That's my main. That's what I'm always in.
01:20:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Either one without profit drivers.
01:20:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll leave them. Actually, I'll leave them both of them, but, okay.
01:21:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then I could also put the link in the chat.
01:21:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's probably fast. Then I'll go do it super quick. Okay. That way it helps with this eyeballs and, um, okay. So where are we at?
01:21:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Uh, right. Then I can see what you're doing too.
01:21:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I. Should be able to work. Okay. if that doesn't work, here's what we do. We just go up here. There.
01:21:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I am. I'm seeing what you're doing. I was just like, screw it. either take it into Canva or hire someone to fix it.
01:21:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. But so that just, and sometimes I will do things like, um, uh, like, I'm not telling you to do this for this one. But anyway, just the little bit of color pop. On things that are really important. Oh, so actually what I would do is do it right here. Oh, shoot.
01:21:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That is not a good color. Sorry.
01:21:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Amazon color. Yeah. It's just, it's. Just a little bit of yeah. Anyway.
01:22:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
01:22:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anything I can do to help energize them immediately and help them focus. And when I'm talking to them, keep them, because everybody's distracted by the phones where you're talking to them, they're looking at all these alerts and notifications or whatever. So if I want them to pay attention to the value I'm bringing and I'm trying to make a sale, or I'm trying to persuade them to say yes and do the thing they need to do, everything I can do to keep their attention focused is for their benefit, but also my clients. I won't drag people. little things to psychologically help them stay focused means that we get there going faster. because I know most entrepreneurs have ADD of some sort or another have focus attention. I'm always trying to be like focus on what I'm having to focus focus. Anyway, I know you got to go.
01:22:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I hope this is helpful. This is really helpful. So, so. the rest of document, though, we didn't finish what's out of scope, though, right?
01:23:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, anything beyond this is out of scope. So, um, like, if you want to write a brand new sales letter, are you doing it? Or are you hiring our copywriter?
01:23:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, well, in the existing funnel of specific upsell one, upsell two, yes, that's in scope.
01:23:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. that's the type of thing I'm thinking. So like you already put graphics out there, a VA is out of scope. So for like following up with customers, that's out of scope. Customer support is out of scope.
01:23:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Hiring and paying a VA. I want to customer support.
01:23:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. would include help desk, FAQs, et cetera. Chatbot, is that in scope of support or out of scope of support?
01:23:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think I can help strategize to chatbot.
01:24:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But actually creating it, I think that someone else should. So chatbot creation and then in parentheses, I will create the strategy. Somebody else must implement or execute, or that's an additional fee. So like, if you want to do it and manage it, even if you outsource it, you need to be paid for that. Yeah, most contracts are not this detailed.
01:24:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know, yeah.
01:24:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then something you might put in parentheses is to improve the beautifying, improve customer content consumption, and execution. Maybe parentheses at the end of it.
01:24:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, or should I just take that out for now? Just graphic design? Yeah, maybe he's really proud of the playbook when I
01:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's awesome.
01:25:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, that's smart.
01:25:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, I'll end up later.
01:25:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oops.
01:25:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like one idea.
01:25:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anything else on a screen?
01:25:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Well, I mean, um, weekends? Yes.
01:25:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, so like I'm not available via text.
01:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not available after this hours unless there's a fire. I always put a fire. So the only thing that, um, a fire is orders are broken and they don't work. But I would still say, um, if you want somebody to fix that type of thing, we have a developer on call.
01:25:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm not your developer. Yeah. Oh, the list is a fire.
01:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In which case you're only available for consulting, not operating or something, whatever.
01:25:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You just say unless there's a fire and then elaborate on a call what that is. Yeah, how about you say weekends? I'm not an electrified balance. So there's fire. That's fine. I think that's, um, I was going to say one more thing that I just thought of. It's important. Oh, cost of the ads.
01:26:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
01:26:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, it's the actual. That's been spent is in your account. On the credit card. I know that's very detailed, but.
01:26:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I should put my half these pink migraine glasses. I should put them over here because they really do help with I string to.
01:26:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would scope would be a brand new low ticket offer. How about that? A brand new low ticket. Well, as that would be an additional.
01:26:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I would say anything outside of what is on this document is out of scope of support.
01:27:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, that's kind of what is on, I would say, what is on this document is out of scope. Oh, sorry.
01:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You like what? What is on this document? What is on the scope of this document? Because then it's kind of like redundant.
01:27:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you think I'm sorry what is on this document? Okay.
01:27:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would make these bullets. And highlight the required 90 day contract. And I would use the brighter yellow for that one, bold bullet. Okay. Thank
01:28:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was going to take out, if you look at the biggest brands, the moans use blue because he uses blue and his branding, but I think we'll just leave it as optimizing the emotions.
01:28:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. going to do this really. What the heck?
01:28:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. I know. don't.
01:28:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's what I hate Google Docs for. Did you copy and paste anything into here?
01:28:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No.
01:28:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's weird. It's not that bad. Okay. Cool. Um, out of scope and then we'll do, you know, there we go up on do, okay.
01:28:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I say contract, but really it's not really contract to say required 90 day commitment.
01:28:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What about? Yeah. There we go. Out of scope. And I would actually make this like, well, that's harsh. Hold on. That's what I'll do. This is. That's. That's. That's. And that.
01:29:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Graphics Designer, as far as telling them what to do, because graphics designer, I'm saying the outsourcing graphic designer.
01:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Graphics creation. Because you'll direct what graphics are needed to be creative and not create them yourself.
01:29:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Director, how's that?
01:29:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
01:29:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Graphics design direction. To increase. I guess I would scope as cost of software is right as well.
01:29:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, for sure.
01:29:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think that sums it up.
01:29:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Awesome. I'm excited for you to have that call. can't wait to hear about it. I'll be like, tell me you got the sale, tell me you got the sale, and you get paid before any other conversations happen paid up front, not after the fact upfront.
01:30:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes, yeah, because it's just the stock and the loan gives in the plan.
01:30:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and yes, and that has lots of value. Okay, so you're amazing. You

painting so it's got my gosh you're so cute yeah yeah I just I even have a picture of me in the car we I painted an old Honda Civic in my parents garage right pink bold pink with oil based house paint and a paintbrush and put a big red vinyl sticker I got made on the sides saying pinky student painting I decided to pull pink to cover the first objection in a blue color town I was raised in of well can a woman really climb a ladder and paint the exterior of my home so I figured just go with that objection and shout to the world that yeah we are women pinky and we're pink I love that yeah yeah so I obviously saw a lot to continue but I was also realizing because you like frameworks and stuff I have a really good framework graphic that I did a while that I think you're gonna love figure out how to just model after that too and some of the stuff we're doing but basically When I sold my social media certification program, I kind of channeled some of the stuff I learned from all the business process of re-engineering and SAP consulting jobs that I did with computer sciences, all that stuff. So basically we made like a really good, say me, but Tommy got half of my ex-husband because he's, he was a consultant too, but we made this really good, what's that?
00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was the voxer thing I just got was from you, I don't know why I just sent it again.
00:01:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anyway, sorry. Oh, no, we're zeroes. So, social media, social certification methodology.
00:01:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just remembered that I made that graphic when I was like, up late.
00:01:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know it was really good, yeah, So, let me just share screen, I'm still looking for, I called it fast-track for social media, media, sort of methodology, and I, all the people that paid $2,000. to the course I got certified, I allowed them to use all of that and the white peppers I created and stuff. So I was realizing that like I gave a lot of good back then that I don't feel I'm elevating this time around that I definitely should. So that's what's good about doing this. Fast track. Let's see if this comes up. copy of Fast Track methodology. Do you see this? My social sales accelerator methodology is this?
00:02:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh it's beautiful.
00:02:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so it was blues. I actually looked like I did for maybe my social sales thing because I just modified it. But the original one is through a loop. So let me see if that comes up. If not, it's in my other Gmail account because I had an old Gmail account that I was using. Oh, that's actually really social.
00:02:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the yellow and gray is the other combination that works really well and you can think of of Amazon. Amazon uses those colors. are some like, yes, yeah, yeah, gray brown, you know, UPS, brown, brown gold, but gold and blue and often they're used together, but those are powerful colors and the gray and black are kind of elite level, right? Which is why Amazon, I mean, in the beginning, um, and even so, they, they've got so much to them, Brown, but UPS, corporate, corporate kind of thing.
00:03:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So here it is. Like, this is the whole webinar presentation at the end of a challenge. I like someone coaching room and, you know, um, that was a review.
00:03:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
love to do a webinar together.
00:03:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We have to get some offers and this is what we're working towards.
00:03:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. I was thinking about it last night and I was, you know, in my prayers and stuff and after, especially after you were consulting and I'm not consulting. I'm asking about the scaling question, I'm just talking to Heavenly Father and I'm like, know, because here's the thing, Maria, like, I'm not trying to build a legacy business, I never have my love is always like, can you protect your brand? got to this? I'm like, babe, this is not my calling forever. This is what I'm doing now, like, I'm, I'm running a book called the prosperity complex. And it talks about, and it's very much the same premise as give a man a fish versus feed a man. feed a manifesting, teach him how to fish, that kind of thing. But it's that you don't solve poverty by giving money. You don't solve poverty by redirecting money or donating or things like that. solve poverty by making self-provident people. And when my babies are grown, all I want to do is go visit my family and my friends, my loves. And I want to strengthen them and I want to teach them skills. I would love to go to Africa. I'd love to go to that any country even do it here, but teach people the same way that I serve my clients just every day people that would never have a chance to learn it because there are so many skills. We figured out lemonade stands where we're kids, know, and mowing lawns like kids can do it. So there are grown people who could completely change their communities if they have somebody just say, number one, you can do it. Here's how you can do it and here's the simplest way to do it because most people don't teach that part, right? that's what I want. So in the meantime, what I'm doing now, I just want to serve God through my people, through my kids, my business, by helping them do that right be self-provident. The money that I need to help people because I have to teach how to fish, but also feed fish until they can
00:06:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
learn, right?
00:06:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so I've got that responsibility and the income that I need and want to generate. But I want to have joy in it and I want to bring joy in. I was just thinking in terms of that scalable, I still think that us spending our time with a few high level clients, and this is the diversification that I've been saying about from the beginning, right? that you don't have just one offer, you have a few offers, you have one that's like really high level that pays well but also gives you the experience of keeping your soft, super sharp and really understanding the businesses inside and out. also because it's a high level client, having higher level expansive mind expanding conversations, right? And then you take it back to the lower levels and just showing up in a community. and me teaching people, nurturing them, loving them and helping them make money. I'm like, that's so like joy for a few years while I finished raising my baby and we making plans with whatever extra money we're doing because one of the things I wanted to do is have my money work for me. And like I imagine the compounding effect of us working together for a few years if you were interested in it and building an off ramp where you do whatever you wanted to do because you've got the money that you do whatever you want to do you can do it because of purpose or and likewise and not that I would just like disappear because when I keep people I keep people forever so there's that but anyway I just thought how much joy would it be to just share community and serve them and love them and teach them the marketing and the business and but also to feed off of their thoughts it's not like we're there are going to be people that are smarter than us in some ways you know sorry did you say something?
00:08:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I had to say Alexa stop. had an alarm for an hour, but I already did it. It was to put the rice back in the fridge. Sometimes I pre-cook rice for dinner.
00:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've gotten lazy and I buy the ones you can just steam in 90 seconds.
00:08:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I have those too. I have lots of those too, but I got a rice cooker.
00:08:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's kind of cool, so yeah. Oh, last night I threw a bunch in the Instant Pot, so it was brown rice chicken, broccoli, with some cream of chicken, and there's some Montreal chicken seasoning, and then some cheese in it.
00:08:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Nice. Montreal chicken season.
00:08:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
at you, Canadian, It's good.
00:08:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That sounds fantastic, actually. I normally would make that with the leftover turkey, but we also have mashed potatoes and stuffing left, so we're just having a repeat tonight. But the kiddos are gone. Amanda's on Thomas. He's doing his master's in speech pathology, and yeah, and he His girlfriend, he just started dating about eight months ago, so this is like the third week and they've come down now So it's kind of really fun having them here So we had a dinner with them on Sunday Just us and then to my family my mom and my brother and sister all and her brother stuff We had a big family and yesterday at their house It was not a good and it was funny because me and a man were talking about our eyes are always so much bigger than everything Because we went to the liquor store thinking oh we're gonna have all this booze for everyone and stuff But all this wine really nice bottles of wine like god will be ever heard of decoy that red. I don't drink Well, this is what's funny cuz we don't drink much either This is why it's funny cuz I don't we're getting all this cuz we get booze for everyone and they're young and stuff and Literally we each had like one glass Saturday night and one glass of wine on Sunday one glass of wine lat yesterday So so we laughed at each other saying well, we got booze that'll last us till well into the new year because I my sister and I were talking about it cuz she drank too much
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the weekend and I was like, when I was 18, I got blackout drunk a couple of times and the fact that I could drink so much, probably also had some marijuana, but drink so much that I first of all, I thought my body was explode and I peed all over myself.
00:10:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So there was that.
00:10:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I didn't remember what I did and when I was told what I did and the way that I behaved was just rude. And I was like, I need to not, and I'm not, I don't do anything by halves. So if I'm on drink, I'm on. So religion or not, I just need to not be a drinker.
00:10:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, it's funny. Um, yeah. So, so it was, yeah, it was really good. So, so yeah. So, but when I, right, I almost like was going to vox you the few hours later saying, Oh, wait, no, disregard the message about these offers and scaling because I realized the first step is you need the pedigree and all my courses use that and then we'll figure out from there. so anyways, that's why. I backed off unboxing you because I'm like, oh, I got to get this done for you.
00:11:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For us. Yeah. Because I really, what I think it's just going to do is make attracting people and make our marketing so much easier.
00:11:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:11:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's not just what you've accomplished, but it's your path of evolution. And so you're not just showing somebody that, look, this is where I am. And this is the success I have now. Like, I got here in steps because everybody has to get where they're going in steps. You don't leapfrog for the most part. So the other thing is I specifically for you is I think that you had forgotten how great you were. Like you knew it, but the details of it every time you would tell the story, you'd be like, I forgot that. And I had paid attention to the fact that you kept saying you forgot that. And so I wanted you to really remember, but also because you've attracted these people and they start to got a connection with you and low ticket and in their mind, maybe lower value, that needs to be corrected. The second part of it was what's your library of content, like what have you created because from that, and you have way more than me to bring to the table, as far as I'm concerned. Way more experience, in terms of volume, the thing that I think that I do the best is that mine has always been leveraged. My effective hourly rate has stayed high for a long time. I've worked very, very little and still done really, really well, but in terms of volume of clients, because I work so little, I don't have a vast experience and I didn't make as much money myself. So I have earned over a million dollars over a few years of coaching, which is you. But I'm less impressive, between your library and your pedigree, that will help convert people a lot. I'm more impressive when you talk to me, more impressive than you. mean, more impressive as a person, but I don't really feel like mine. There are some accomplishments that people go, wow, I think, but I think I just have less of them.
00:13:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, and the thing is what you'll find about all my stuff, you look at it all, that probably if I stuck to one of those, I would be in a far different position right now. Because I totally realized that, look at Amy Portafield, like she had, I remember when she first, like I used to be a search term on Google, like people, like I'm sorry on Facebook ads, you know, interest. So back in the day. So, so, and that was before Amy Portafield even existed. And then she came out with her podcast and all this stuff. And then she, but she stuck with it. Like, yeah, she had webinars that convert. That was her. first thing, but then she converted to Digital Course Academy, and she stuck with it. Like all this time, or look at Brooke Castillo, the life coach school, like she stuck with it. Yeah, she's going through whatever changes she's going through right now, but she like, so I think that was my biggest downfall because probably if I stuck with just the social media certification, because that social media is still hot now, then it was like years ago, but this whole webinar, after the challenge selling this, because you know, they even got a certificate.
00:14:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This was back in 2000.
00:14:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Wow. Yeah, this back in 2011 for social media was huge. So I could have been like the, what's that other gal? The blonde here that wears the turquoise blue all the time.
00:14:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mary, Mary, she's glazer.
00:14:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I like her too. No, she's the Facebook queen, Facebook loves her, and got her to speak a lot on the Facebook stages. Mary, I forget. Anyway, so I'll come to my mind, but But this whole thing took a hell of a lot of work to create.
00:15:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How do I have stesses, lot of testimonials.
00:15:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I think it was probably just because with divorcing Rudy and everything since I felt he helped me create behind the scenes this. Maybe, so he was sort of like that Tony Robbins on my shoulder and a really motivational. Yeah, maybe I just felt. now. Yeah, yeah, so maybe with that I just felt I didn't really want. Well, so something I'm a shiny object. want new technology. Everyone's doing social media now. So let me do something different, but like this, you know, this is all really good graphics and stuff.
00:15:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
know we can update it to 2000, you know, 24 terms, but still this was like really damn good. So think about though is that because I've beaten myself up for the jumping around and things that I do, but I'm a generalist. I'm not a specialist. I do have specialized skills and to me, that is leverage and it is simplicity. But it's even those are general type terms, right? They can be applied universally with benefit. But the value that you have in having all of that experience is that the nuance of your knowledge and understanding, one of the greatest assets I have brought to companies that I manage their operations and the way that one of the reasons I was able to get them to grow so well wasn't just my structure. It was my liaising between the different departments because I knew them because I'd done their jobs. I've done copy, I've done graphics, I've done development, not to the same level, but I knew enough to know your program lying to you about how hard this is or how long this takes or how much it costs. fire him. them or fire me because I'm not going to keep putting up with this attitude and him holding everybody else back and things got fixed. But because I understood every aspect of the business, top to bottom, left to right, diagonally, my ability to manage it really well, that's where it came from because I done the jobs. So you understand like multi-channel marketing in a whole new kind of way. You understand the ins and outs of the channels. You know how to leverage a single channel, but you know so many things. Now at this season in life, it may behoove you to stay more focused in a particular realm. the realm can be a realm of slightly ambiguous generality so that still explore nuance. So, for example, with business systems, teams operations, these are the things I talk about. I get to play with technology because systems and technology go hand in hand.
00:18:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, that's a whole lot of shiny that I get to play with.
00:18:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And yeah, I mean, that's the biggest thing, technology in terms of project management in terms of automations for customer in terms knowledge and connection and even customer nurturing with the automation, right? So not just acquiring, but nurturing and extracting everything you can out of each customer and increasing the lifetime value, but making that reciprocal and creating the nurturing that gives everything you can back into the customer. That's a lot of shiny for me. That's fun because there's so many different, you know, like AI, all. these different things. But also the psychology of how to do that. So I get to study marketing psychology and I get to study leadership, which is more shiny to me because I love like Adam Grant and I love Robert Chaldini. And those are shiny for me because there's a new thing and I'm like, ooh, what happens if I apply here? But it's still like I've been doing systems. Everybody knows me as a systems person, which has kind of been detrimental to me because I'm way more than that, but that's where put their heads around.
00:19:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
your copy, your marketing, adult productivity as well.
00:19:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, everything. Yeah, mindset. Yeah. So anyway, I do also have to leave at like 1145 because my daughter is home and she needs me to take her to school.
00:19:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I've got a hard stop in 20 minutes. And I'm really sad because I don't want to talk about all these things. That's okay. Hey, we'll have tomorrow, too. Well, let me update you couple of things. I haven't said anything to Joe, but I can. I can just kind of respond and say, look, Joe, oh, yeah, we've been, sorry, we've also been swamped with other people that want to hire our services for kind of what we have. So we're going to, we don't have a bandwidth right now to help you, but just, you know, and just leave it like that, you know, nice.
00:20:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you can say whatever. I still think that like it's not even necessary, that you do have other people interested in talking to you, but just the, the message I said might be too blunt for you. I don't know if you remember it on boxers.
00:20:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
was long. I thought it was quite long. That's the only thing I thought.
00:20:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's totally possible to you.
00:20:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But it's so funny. It's totally possible. Let's see. Let's see. Boxer. I thought it left an opening for her to actually still hire us.
00:21:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, yes, she wanted to do the pocket CMOC.
00:21:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, but I know she won't. No, she won't because she's asked us a lot more of free.
00:21:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Exactly.
00:21:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Uh.
00:21:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You just do search hi, Joe, but it's to be right above that.
00:21:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know how to search in Boxer.
00:21:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right up there.
00:21:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Where?
00:21:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where's the search? Search chat title titles. It's just as titles.
00:21:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Never mind. Yeah.
00:21:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You should do control F though.
00:21:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Uh, just Joe.
00:21:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi, Joe, maybe there it is for Joe.
00:21:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
At least that. Not think about it or apply. might send him this. We have to have all that we said that you want to call your man. I just mentioned we have managed on this one to test where you get it with this offer. Yeah, that's why I thought no, because I think she's still going to be unhappy. Don't you think, if she buys the CMO, pocket CMO, COO, don't you think she's going to be there?
00:22:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
won't buy it.
00:22:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, so just leave it like this then, because you know she's not going to buy it? because she won't buy it, because you still gave her the window, but she's not going to buy it. Okay, okay. Okay. Go through all your . for a of I know I laughed little bit when she said, well, plus the percentages, that's $250,000. thinking, it's $250,000 and nothing, because it doesn't have it's too risky whether we'll get it.
00:22:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was one of the other causes of mine in Rudy's divorce. the other part of this being long is it's tedious, guess what she's been, tedious.
00:22:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes. All right. Oh. So it's from you, the software that Marie and I put out. So did you want to respond to her with this?
00:23:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
can do that.
00:23:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I can be the .
00:23:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:23:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. you do that, yeah, because I've got good news. I got three strong candidates in the pipeline for, yeah. So remember that one guy that we drafted the scope for Grant Mueller? He did pay $1,000. He actually said send me the pay public. So then he said, I'm looking to start this Friday. I know it's your Canadian Thanksgiving. So I said, OK, well, let's all get together with all to send you some information after Thanksgiving. And so by Friday, he gives me access to his account. Is that then I'll send him the other invoice for $4,000? So that's $5,000 a month. So that's good. And then you know who came out of the blue. And again, there's a lot of lurkers, I guess, in the NHB board stuff was I don't know you know. But he's a pretty big player in the manifestation niche. Um, oh my god. He does affirmations Let me go to Facebook get you know us Noah St.
00:24:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is that it that's when you said Noah that was the name of pop to my head that I don't know him I just know the name.
00:24:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah Ditto I think ages ago one of my colleagues did some work for him before he was famous And I know I think I may have consulted him like I'm talking 15 years ago Off for an hour about social media strategy, but that was way back in the day So he so I don't think he knows Recognize that was me because I think it was through a colleague, but um, yeah, that was when he was nothing now look at him So yeah, so he's interested So I'm gonna talk to him tomorrow afternoon. We arrange a call for tomorrow afternoon So nothing's determined yet or anything and then there's another guy that wants to do He also is from NHB Allen's group. He used to have a yoga, the modern yoga.com brand. He sold it off, so it sailed and go that well because the urnout that I was supposed to be paid by the new owners never really came. And that's typical. That's happened to me too when I sold one, something before. And so he said, but he did with that company, he helped yoga instructors establish courses online and sell stuff online and basically do webinar funnels. He said, so I have funnels that really work and I'd really like to get into recurring revenue of Go High Level. So he wants to create a low ticket product that can then put people into Go High Level. Basically giving away that $10,000 course that he used to have. Basically it was given away. So I've been talking him back and forth and I said, I'm simply giving away. You should just create a little take a funnel with that, right? then it blah blah blah. So anyway, he actually is pretty serious as well, but he's in Thailand right now on vacation or something. So we're going to chat tomorrow morning briefly and see if there's any legs. for him, I did tell him $20,000. So yeah.
00:26:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:26:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So we'll have to figure this all out if this all comes fruition because remember, we haven't got an agreement yet, but there are certain aspects where I think initially, I don't mind getting the money coming into me for cash flow of the one client, Brett Mueller. But for the others, if we want to take them, I'd rather see maybe the money going to you in the US, because in Canada, well, they're not Canadian, so it's not an issue. If a Canadian pays me, it's paying me because you got to pay HST because I have an HST license, which is harmonized sales tax, then you got to charge them GST. like GST is like 13%. So if they buy 20,000 from you, you have to add an extra 30% tax or else the government's going to come to me for it. So it's way better for you also taking the money into your US entity and all that jazz.
00:26:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I do not know enough about anything in structure, but so how Um, do you get, um, like, is there a different type of payment? So, so like we have employment, self employment tax, and then we have personal tax. So like if the company gets paid a certain amount, that's one thing. And if I as a person get paid a certain amount, that's a different thing, they're taxed differently. So like, how would that work for you? is it just that, um, I would take it and then pay you, and just because you're getting reduced amount, you're not having to pay that initial 13%. So it stays the tax.
00:27:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
how does that work? No, well, well, first of all, like I was mentioning this so that you get money as well. Like this is part of the joint venture because you're helping, you know, with those other clients, like if that's why I would say that, um, those, these warm clients, it doesn't really matter if they're not living in Canada.
00:27:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't charge only if they're in Canada.
00:27:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Do you have to charge 30% like as long as they're anywhere else in the world, it's not an issue. So that's why like 99% of my clients are outside of Canada. I really don't like having Canadian clients don't really, they take too long to make a decision. First of all, they're very conservative, add the Canadian dollar, I want to get paid in the U.S.
00:28:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like what I did with Creed is like I would just invoice her, you make money and then whatever the amount, I'll just invoice her.
00:28:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And so I'm like a consultant to you that you're, you're paying, but it's sort of, I'm just thinking down the road because I don't, you know, let's just say if like 20k comes in in the next like 30 days, I want you to have some of that. So that's kind of where that's coming from too.
00:28:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're good to team.
00:28:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That are going to get emotional. Yeah.
00:28:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like you making everybody else money, but like it's good to be able to take care of my people too, you know? Yeah. I, it would be great. And I got to tell you like the gratitude that you do marketing because that's the thing. I don't, I don't whatever. We've had these conversations before. It's just not, I'm ambivert and I really withdraw a lot. Now, to serve is a whole different thing, the marketing aspect of it just drains me. I love the service and I love the work and showing up and getting to do that. And if we could bring in a few high level clients that we could serve really well together. And then if we could siphon off enough time to work on a smaller offer that's scalable, I really think it would be joyful to serve a community together and just to teach people and to love them and to serve them. I think that we'd feel blessed. think we're much as given much as required, know, and God has blessed us with really strong personalities and minds and hearts. And I just know that the world needs it and all the good people. that are out there, there's not enough of them serving. So anyway, I just, I feel happy borrowing joy from the future in the hope knowing that we're building this and just getting to talk to you every day to makes me happy.
00:30:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm really good.
00:30:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm borrowed joy from the future. So to me, when you worry, you borrow pain from the past.
00:30:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But when you hope you borrow joy from the future. Wow. When you worry, you borrow pain from the past.
00:30:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. Yeah. I heard a phrase once that is don't go borrowing troubles. I think it's a, you know, a black thing that I heard. But then I realized that one of my powers has always been even as a kid is, I live in the present, but I always borrow energy from the future that I'm creating. I live in that moment, as though it's the reality. you know, as I got older, it's the kind of a law of attraction, you know, things like, like, it's already happened. And that was never a concept to me, but if actually it had, because I felt it. And I felt the reality of it strongly enough that it brought me joy and energy. So that's what I think about. Like, I can literally borrow energy from a future that doesn't even exist right now of all the infinite possibilities with hope. And it makes me happy in the now.
00:31:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love it.
00:31:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get to talk to you.
00:31:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
just, every time I'm saying my present, it's just so hey, what trellible. board are you thinking of that that would be part of the scope? said, we'll make them a trellibor so they're responsible for their own data, which I love because as an agency with Emily Hirsch, like we'd always provide them Friday stats, but very few clients I've read it, they'd have no clue still and then you know what I mean? Like I loved your whole thought process of they know what the heck we're doing so they get the value of what they've invested in.
00:32:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yay, let me see if I can find the template that I used to use for base camp because we can start with that. Course creator template bundle? is that? Oh no, that's campa. But I could even create one from scratch because I've done it so many times. I feel like I found it and showed it to you and drive. was a, I think I probably have a few of them, but we, it would be fresh because I don't have anything in Trello. But basically, So, you know, and we can do most of this in our sleep probably, and as we've had conversations and talking about implementation, I rattle off this step, this step, this step, this step, that's what we've done. So basically what you do is you, we could put multiple boards in Trello. So let's say you're launching a new digital offer. And so in there, you would have a copy section and a graphic section and a development section, and then a marketing section, because these are all the pieces that go together. So the first thing that has to happen is the offer has to be created, and then market research has to be done before you can give it to a copywriter or the copywriter is doing it.
00:33:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's an assignment.
00:33:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So, and then you define does that offer match, right? market research and offer creation. kind of it's kind of a circle like chicken and egg kind of thing one can happen before the other but then you need to go reiterate based based on what you find. So then it goes to copy and then the graphic designer really needs the copy before he can put you know graphics together because there's the verbiage that goes on to the e-books or the ad graphics or whatever. The developer needs the copy and the graphic to landing page, opt-in, So then you've got the developmental operations on that side but then you also add the copy if there's a you know abandoned cart sequence. there's a nurturing sequence after they opt in to send them to a sale where they purchase the sale and then there's a you know follow up or they're upset like all of these things have to be mapped out so all of that could be put into a project management suite and so not only do they wrap their whole heads around it but they could literally just change the title slightly assign a person put a due date and one of the things we can do and talk about is like you know you should expect about this much time for this process to happen if you're doing it well and if you've hired it well you can get this accomplished for roughly this amount of time and money and then we could also pair that up with the PTE maximizer right profit time energy maximizer and go like look make your decisions based off of what you already know here if you're going to hire somebody you know we one of the things we did was your effective hourly rate so who are we hiring or are you doing it Are you writing the copy? you doing the development? Are you putting your name in there? That may be the case because sometimes we've got more time than we have money. Even if we have almost no time, you might be dear money. Anyway, so no matter who we're serving, even when I go on to people who have made millions of dollars, most of them don't have project management suites and they don't have that. So people, so your lurkers, if we do some screenshots of some of this stuff, and it doesn't matter if people steal it, so what? There's enough for us, we don't need everybody to buy from us. We just need enough people to buy from us. We'll make sure that happens if we're out there surfing, so we don't need to worry about who steals and he tries to whatever. You can't take with mine. He won't let you, so whatever. Yeah, so as people, and there will be lurkers who will sometimes, especially if we don't have a high ticket cost where they can come in and check out everything, they'll go on to be like. like Dan does that all the time, Dan Ryan, he goes and buys people stuff and then he goes and hires them for a very long time and gives them a lot of money because he's like, yeah, all your stuff.
00:37:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You're super smart. How do I get you?
00:37:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, I think that that could be a massive value, especially if on top of that they get access to being able to show up on our weekly calls or ask questions in a group or whatever. And then they start to the questions inspire more questions and more answers. So one person asked the questions that somebody else didn't even know to think and ask about. And then they're all like, oh, and I'm like, well, yeah, I didn't think about teaching you about that. But I could teach you about that. you know, like it all just feeds and builds upon itself. And it could be very lucrative, very quickly, because you don't find a pair like you and me just in there.
00:37:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, I agree. So but this is specific for like say Grant, right? Like he's probably We're going to want to see some thing happening in Trello.
00:38:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if you put it up, we would just have one of our conversations, you and me, or even them. And I've just set it up and build it, build it, manage it, run it, do like just do operations, plus support you in marketing, basically, whatever is needed to show up, because the faster we do it, and I, there's also the saying many hands make light work. Like, it'll just be easier.
00:38:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. And what's cool is that he's probably out of the three. He's the best guy to start with, because he's already got a low ticket funnel started. He just doesn't have a good order bump. He doesn't have enough cell one, doesn't have enough cell two. So he really just needs the refinement versus the other two will be starting something from scratch and a little bit harder to get momentum. But yeah, this would be good.
00:38:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if you sell anybody and we work together and I get paid, here's what you should know about me.
00:38:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Everybody's business like it's own.
00:39:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to come in and nurture the crap out of it and offer it to serve. also mindful of not stepping on toes. don't need to be the star of the show. I don't need to be ego. Like, we had the conversation with Joe. Like, I talked, I'll lead, but I'm not trying, but I don't need to dominate. I don't need it. You know what I mean? And it's important to know that because sometimes you work with people and you're like, they just, you know, like they got it to go and they want to make it about them.
00:39:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't care. I care about you.
00:39:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I care about how you feel at the end of everything more than I'll care about them.
00:39:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. And I'm kind of the same. you know, I've probably give too much to their company, right? yeah. so, I hope I had to be ego more 12 years ago, but I think my ego sort of more humbled out. I was a jerk.
00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was.
00:40:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Okay. So, uh, yeah. So let's just play by your about the other ones. Um, the other two, but I think Grant's in if he made the pause unless he chickens out, we'll see. And then we'll go from there.
00:40:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know you got to go soon. I do. I wanted to. I was so excited. I'm a nerd about like I'm a five year old about this graphic that I made.
00:40:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes.
00:40:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I made it. I'm like, it kind of actually reminds me of one of my client's images. I'm like, did I mentally steal something that we've used before?
00:40:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, because it's, no, because it's, it's very similar to the Emily Hirsch one and I'm the intellectual property creator of that.
00:40:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, I'm excited. can exist still for a while. As we had, oh, so the colors are blue and orange. That still exists. Am I on that page still? I'm still on there.
00:40:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, my gosh.
00:40:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What?
00:41:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Show me.
00:41:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, sure, sure.
00:41:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You'll learn.
00:41:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sure screen, sure screen. I went to LA for this photo shoot.
00:41:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, sure.
00:41:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not the right thing.
00:41:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's the website.
00:41:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
D4Ybrandbuilder.com. D4Y. Yeah, I turned that into a seven figure agency within month. And then he just destroyed it by taking our too many clients too fast.
00:41:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:41:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that's it.
00:41:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Are you in the about? No, so on the home page, there's D4Y and there's a laptop. There's Arthur and I'm to the left of him. Oh, yeah, there you go. And there's .com secrets. Why did he show .com secrets just for the branding?
00:41:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's just for what he calls them. Arthur is something else. Oh, brand recognition. see that. like, yeah, he didn't work with them or anything, but he follows that stuff. Competitive analysis, value letter design, strategic evolution, community build-outs, social media management, email marketing, and I ran everything in that company.
00:42:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, well.
00:42:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Services, let's see what they have for clients. Oh, nature select. I forgot about that. Our rows forgot about them too. Gymnast, whatever. Anyway, we had, we had a graphic and it was kind of like the value letter design. And I feel like after I saw this, I'm like, it seems similar to some D for Y stuff, but I don't remember. Anyway, but Yeah, but it was inspired with the Emily, her stuff, but also for sure.
00:43:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've created other graphics and had graphics.
00:43:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where's the Canva thing? But, um, what, what I actually liked and what I kept like reiterating is the right thing. Nope, that's not the right thing. Canva design. I'll just go home. Oh my gosh. I just made my thing go away. My daughter don't reply to me.
00:43:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
She's probably like passed out.
00:43:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It takes lunch anyway at school. She doesn't have to be there right now. But what I kept working on is, and it seems like it wouldn't be that much because there's not actually that much here. But this, whatever we put into here. This is what I think is unique is replicating the will determine maintainable cost and pace of scaling.
00:43:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't think people really think about that much and I don't think.
00:44:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if I in implementing complimentary or supplementary offers based on customer feedback, and so that's all the more looking at data, but, but I think that so like this could be a whole kind of PDF and then the next one like break down day zero through 90 and much more detail and 90 through 80 and much more detail, like each of the faces in more detail. So people go like, that's a lot to be giving to me to walk me through to help me do. Um, like I think that we can make amazing webinar slides out of this. Yeah, agree. Easy on the eyes. think it looks professional. I was kind of proud of this.
00:44:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think it looks amazing. Can you share that with me? Yeah. Yeah.
00:44:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't share the link.
00:44:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You, you know, it says only you could. Yeah. I think I was going to say. You probably thought of Oh, is this like the done for you brand builder only because it's the blue and the Orange gold. Yeah, I think that's the only similarities So and if you're unsure about that we could change growth Nope, I'm not changing nothing. I've built most that anyway. Yeah, got it Yeah, no, love all this because also this can just be repeatable to sell to other people who want to start an Agency and then that's how we could make recurring revenue. think from go high level because then we can Give them a snapshot of the website that includes the methodology things. Maybe we create some white papers for them Share some case studies they could use It's taking what I did for social media certification, but doing it for like Agencies or entrepreneurs or something.
00:45:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yes So the snapshots can match up with the projects all set in a way in the in the template Mm-hmm Yeah, anyway, and I do think I think that so the thing that I was thinking is that the visual representation, and I think I sent that in the message, but you know, I'll go do a quick search marketing campaign, low chart, there's tons of these.
00:46:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
How come your computer just got really small mobile sized.
00:46:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Yeah, there. So, like, we could make versions of this with our colors and branding. Oh, yeah. But we can make variations of this. what it would look like to launch a main product or relaunch or add an order bump into the mix or upsell or whatever or turn it into a recurring revenue. you had a one off at all, you had this high ticket, like, yeah, how you, you know, so anyway.
00:46:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, no, I get it, Ravi Abubala was good at that using Lucidchart. He, I think, sold a lot of his initial class. Science because he showed a damn good flow chart of stuff. Um, yeah, I have an account for them but I never really used it a lot.
00:47:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I never use it, but I have it and I'm like, you know what? Ryan?
00:47:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Did you buy it way back in the days when it was like, yeah, me too.
00:47:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:47:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. I think that produces great flow charts.
00:47:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Some people use Miro now too, M-I-R Mind. Yeah. Mindjet. Um, what's another one? Yeah, there's one to the man. There's flowy something like that.
00:47:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's right. Yeah.
00:47:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
then the Giffy even G-I-O. Giffy. Giffy. That's the one that Dan has built our org charts with. Yeah. yeah, org charts, like some super basic org charts, like two team org charts and like really show what they're doing. Yeah. How it evolves into three, five, 10, 20 and how You know, you can have a multi seven figure business with a five person team and it's not that difficult. If you do it, right?
00:48:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You can have a multi what business seven figure seven figure. They're right down to maybe that's our slogan Multi seven figure business no one says that Yeah, well, that's my ears perked up because everyone's like here's how to have a six figure business six figure six months I know sounds people like it. They're good hooks, but that's unique You can have a multi seven figure business with a five person team like it's very specific.
00:48:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like that Yeah, I mean, I've worked to them There are lots of them, but they're not Vanking noise on social media.
00:48:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They're just living their lives. Well, we can also say you can have a multi six figure business with a three person team or two Yeah, two person team.
00:48:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, three or or 1.5 right and One is a two point five and the other one's a two point five because and so yeah We can have a whole webinar of team structure and what you could do with that and talking about Operations and teams and going through my profit time energy maximizing go. This is this is what this looks like when when everything is leveraged So I should go wake up my daughter.
00:49:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think she probably passed.
00:49:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm feeling good But she's trying to keep up with school, so okay, I'll let you make let me um, so we'll meet tomorrow I would love to have an agenda for calls as often as we can if we can start getting that slow with that Yeah, I think we're always productive and really good, but as we're tightening it into specific Yeah, um things that we want to accomplish so you're working on the the pedigree and Putting stuff together, and I think we're kind of mentally I think if we put the main focus towards getting a couple of high high-end clients that we
00:50:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
can work on serving together.
00:50:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there's money to build things with and then the time there we will be spending time actually fulfilling that and the rest of it we can be like okay now we've got some assets to work with. Let's build a simple funnel with what we have and that's where our previous trainings will come in and then maybe we just do some live webinar trainings and build content out of that. Something to think about but anyway. So tomorrow let's just pick it up from where we're at right now and then put the intention out that within the next couple weeks try to create agendas for each of our

Can you hear me? Yeah. So did you said to say hi?
00:00:08 - mark sweet
Yeah, they are COVID. So he's having fun.
00:00:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what he said.
00:00:12 - mark sweet
Well, everybody but him. For now, you know how that goes. We know where this is going.
00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. He is awesome.
00:00:23 - mark sweet
Yeah. Yeah.
00:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Thank you for that. If Dr. B is anything like that, then I would really love to do that. No, no, no.
00:00:32 - mark sweet
No, I wish. But now.
00:00:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi, Dan. Hey.
00:00:41 - mark sweet
Hey. Okay. Before we jump into a bunch of stuff, I just want to get some clarification on a couple of things before I forget. Okay. This is more Dan related than anything else. Okay. Valiant, TRG, et cetera, et cetera leads. Those are now no longer going to HQ intake, right?
00:00:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. And after they are no longer going there. Okay. Yeah, so only thing going there now are like. I can confirm this, but it's like 50% roughly of. One of five. And then, and then leads, and then leads when they're 96 hours old.
00:01:24 - mark sweet
Okay.
00:01:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Which we could turn off.
00:01:27 - mark sweet
Yeah, the quantified there still getting the same content information we are. So we had the scene where we're both calling the same person again.
00:01:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know how that's happening. They're saying that. They're only sending them to us. So. Stend over like the most recent emails of those people because we'll have to trace. The zaps and the automations and see if there's something, something must be up somewhere. or quantifies some of us still sending them there, but they said they weren't. I mean, I saw her response and she said, she's only sending them to us.
00:02:11 - mark sweet
Yeah, you know, SEC, Eric, too, we're just you.
00:02:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:02:18 - mark sweet
It's just, it's creating some friction and knowing that we're going to be pulling some leads. I don't want create more friction. Yeah. So if we have to just switch all quantified just to them, so be it.
00:02:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Sure.
00:02:32 - mark sweet
But the quantified cost per lead is shockingly low, like solid. There's some issues we got with some clients who were like, oh, I thought I was doing something else and I don't want to move forward, but that just happens. But again, given the amount.
00:02:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They convert.
00:02:55 - mark sweet
They convert and their cost per position is low. So now it's like doing also one. And now try the Utah thing again and with just them.
00:03:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That would be a good way to start.
00:03:08 - mark sweet
Right, because we already now have it where the Utah do this before that's just signing cases. Right. And that was their big issue.
00:03:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:03:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Chocker.
00:03:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's not cool. He can do it.
00:03:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, oh, really do.
00:03:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Really? Come on.
00:03:27 - mark sweet
Well, yeah, so I might try to do that because I don't think it's going to cost me more than a couple of grand a month.
00:03:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. And it can just sort of seed that pipeline at least get, right? Because the next thing is, how does that dude handle a case, right? unfortunately, you're not going to be able to see how he manages it. But here's the benefit. It's Salko's thing. So if it doesn't go bad, you know who's going to freak out. It doesn't go good.
00:04:01 - mark sweet
I mean, he'll lose his , which is perfect Because I'm wondering if we should just switch back and just have HQ intake just Oh, and then just do all quantify including Utah yeah, and that way there's not I mean, I don't they seem to do particularly well with those leaves.
00:04:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't get it But that is Certainly the way it looks right.
00:04:36 - mark sweet
I'm sure if we dove into the map it would back it up Right.
00:04:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't understand it, but it is what it is Right, and some things don't need to be fully understood I mean, that's that's a simple fix. mean then we don't even need to figure out what's wrong Yeah, we should do that Texting her grin Well, we're actually Stacy. I can't sit at air because I mean, we get lost, but I know he's not super busy, so.
00:05:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So will HQN take be doing any other leads?
00:05:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They do the 96 hour old leads.
00:05:24 - mark sweet
And the Sunday leads?
00:05:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, they still got leads.
00:05:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's that volume?
00:05:37 - mark sweet
Sunday?
00:05:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and they're core.
00:05:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The 96. Yeah, the 96 has even been on a week. So it's hard to say. It used to be 72, but there's no point. We can't really go back and figure it out. So, we'd have to look at it going forward. forward and I don't know what it will be, but when they send over a report, if we look at when the 96 got turned on, I'll confirm with Eric, then it will be, you know, well, I guess, if we make this change today, so we'll have to use today as the date, or the date when Eric says, so hopefully it would technically be probably tomorrow. So if he makes up the today, tomorrow becomes quantifiable and 96, then, and Sunday, if we wait a week, pretty much whatever that number is next week is probably the number other than adding a Utah, which may or may not happen this week, but it'll be in the neighborhood. so who is the attorney for Utah?
00:06:59 - mark sweet
No, it's his name. I don't know if I'm top of my head.
00:07:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Not me either. Saka's buddy.
00:07:06 - mark sweet
Yeah.
00:07:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Machine comes up as So good name. Saka's buddy.
00:07:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I don't. Oh, yeah, we did.
00:07:16 - mark sweet
Okay. So he started. I want to say it's Brad.
00:07:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This.
00:07:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, great.
00:07:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I forgot about that. Yeah. haven't talked about it, but I, you started in like December, right? Somewhere around there.
00:07:34 - mark sweet
Yeah. was very bad.
00:07:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How's it going now?
00:07:39 - mark sweet
Like, I don't see. We stopped because it was very, very, very bad.
00:07:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:07:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what's changed that we're going to be doing this now?
00:07:50 - mark sweet
Okay. Now he lets us sign for him. The issue before was he wasn't picking up. the phone, they weren't good on intake. They weren't good on intake.
00:08:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:08:08 - mark sweet
And so now we're able to walk around that issue, I guess, for lack of letter term, if we can just sign it up and if it drops it, it is what it is. The only sign like one or two cases, I haven't heard anything about how they're going. I'll be lucky if I break it even on those.
00:08:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then what is the purpose of being there?
00:08:32 - mark sweet
Because we spent 17,000 with Walker, quantified it significantly cheaper.
00:08:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So was break even, but now you think it could be profitable?
00:08:46 - mark sweet
If we only sign, but you might be break even. Right. But here, we're like under two granted case.
00:08:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:08:58 - mark sweet
So. If again, better.
00:09:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I'm looking at that. got to refresh this report. The Dan DD intake. Dashboard. Okay.
00:09:24 - mark sweet
He goes to quantify or something. Smaller ones work. This is a way we can expand it more. He's back. Yeah.
00:09:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which one is quantified?
00:09:40 - mark sweet
Is that blue steel?
00:09:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Well, speaking of Actually, sorry, Mark, were you, did you discuss other things that you wanted to get to first?
00:09:53 - mark sweet
That was kind of the main thing.
00:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So. Um, report updates. Dan, do we have any?
00:10:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's a Stacy question. So she, she sent over the stuff that you sent. So probably not.
00:10:12 - mark sweet
mean, so she sent it over.
00:10:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. finished all the others. All the other stuff was done, but the stuff that you that we came up with last Monday, have not, he hasn't, he hasn't updated us on that. So there's probably no update.
00:10:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. All right. Um, let's go look at this. Oh, yeah. That was my. Oh, no, haven't met with. So, okay. I'm meeting with Lauren's Wednesday. Um, and, but I talked to you Thursday instead of Monday. So, okay. I don't have anything new to report there, obviously.
00:10:54 - mark sweet
Um, this week, I'm doing a San Diego run.
00:10:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:10:59 - mark sweet
What? I'm What's in Sano Sacramento?
00:11:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
San Diego.
00:11:04 - mark sweet
wouldn't love any of your cases. We've actually done really, really well with them. We just, I get your boy, Zach.
00:11:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Zach, come on buddy.
00:11:17 - mark sweet
I know.
00:11:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Although he did tell me that like, he said that. Look at what he said. I should hit him up.
00:11:27 - mark sweet
He's running the same issue. more buddies. Like he would like to send me cases. He just doesn't have a lot coming through.
00:11:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. And but I can't remember if he knew whether or not they already had a lawyer or it was too late.
00:11:45 - mark sweet
I wonder if we should.
00:11:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Wonder if we should look at his stuff and be like. What are the issues. Like, hey, what is the status, right? car accident, right? Obviously would. Look at the ones that were car accident and then say, okay, have a lawyer, don't have a lawyer, have a lawyer, obviously, we'd be like, I'm just I know you. And then the other one would be don't have a lawyer. And then is it too late? It's probably the case is what, but I don't know. And what are the odds he's collecting all this data? I'll let him buy me some beer and then tell him how to run this business.
00:12:32 - mark sweet
He said he turned everything AI in his office. So you're not even a front desk person anymore.
00:12:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Nice. Yeah.
00:12:43 - mark sweet
It's interesting.
00:12:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The ads are the automation. How's that going? All We're going to do.
00:13:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Do that? don't know if we were actually doing that.
00:13:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are we not?
00:13:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know. I don't remember if we said to do it, but if we are, it's going to go. We're going to do it. Eric's back. So Eric was on the town. So I'll queue it up. We probably put that live today too.
00:13:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Would there be any reason we would not do that?
00:13:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't remember. I don't remember talking about it. I was like, he asked me. Are we doing it?
00:13:29 - mark sweet
go, I don't think we talked about it.
00:13:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Anywho.
00:13:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so that was still.
00:13:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We are doing it, apparently. I don't remember saying we were doing it. I remember pitching it, but then I was like, Oh, it was pitched and approved.
00:13:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My notes say Dan can create an automation that is the answer of the automation and see what happens. No. No. Let's see. So that we can now intake and close. I certainly can close.
00:13:58 - mark sweet
I think her issue was.
00:14:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
early when each doing take wasn't good oh yeah so we killed that that got killed on Friday too so we can now make one because all ads certainly leads as of Saturday well other than Sunday right there's still that Sunday thing but the vast majority of ads certainly leads we can now segment into their own automation we'll do that three calls in an hour yada yada yada and then they're gonna they're like they want to get out of washington they're like you guys for whatever reason washington isn't working but new mexico is so they're like we're gonna focus more on new mexico's and that's fine i'm not really hmm i'll have some with it you talk well we don't need that now no no no don't don't yeah i'm not just like just we to try to make some side money basically i don't want to be a mean focus yeah if we've got any that are very cost efficient for lower volume which is what we're seeing
00:15:04 - mark sweet
Yeah.
00:15:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where is the doctor report?
00:15:09 - mark sweet
Was it America that's working on it? Yeah, you should be sure it on it.
00:15:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, I'm going with share with me. I wish I know I've seen it, but I don't. I got to start it so I can. Do you know what it's called? No.
00:15:37 - mark sweet
I would assume like doctor map or something.
00:15:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I just looked up doctors and share with me.
00:15:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I swear Google Drive sucks when you search for stuff.
00:15:46 - mark sweet
Yeah, it really holds. It's list. 2023 to present.
00:15:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. It's cool.
00:15:55 - mark sweet
Drive definitely needs a little more.
00:16:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so let me send you an email asking you, or I can ask you, and America, I don't know. But I would like to see that and then I'm just going to bookmark it make sure it's in a place where I can see it all the time. See Mark. Mark.
00:16:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I can't find it either.
00:16:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You want to CC America just sent you.
00:16:42 - mark sweet
I'm going to give her control that part. What's her email should pop up that America.
00:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get is the American now lines coming up. Okay. I'm very different. Yeah.
00:17:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Eric looked at that that you sent over and they got sent to each cube because. The 96 hours it expired. So there's got to be. We have to look at it like we need to figure out a way to know for sure. Either they both hit and contact the person on the same day.
00:17:43 - mark sweet
But like we signed her before.
00:17:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. So that means we need some sort of. So why didn't we see it as them being in contact? There's something we have to figure out. It should. a band that they were in pending contact or and then they didn't advance so we just need to figure out a way to go oh we're talking to them right um that should be pretty it's pretty cool i mean anything else i'm pending contact yeah i think a lot of times they just leave a person in pending contact but well we can let me look at it and then we can yeah what looks at it what was that i was reading i was sending up that emo who's the eric looked eric looked at that thing that even though we don't well we still need it for the 96 hours but the one that mark was like hey they double contact with them we figured out it's because it got sent to them but it technically should know but the question is how do we stop that in the future but i'll bet they're all like that yep yeah so it's like um We just got to find a signal we can use.
00:19:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So is the error happening on a technology level or an intake level?
00:19:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like people, yeah, it's a people, yeah. So process, it's like a process issue, right?
00:19:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how are you solving that?
00:19:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know yet.
00:19:29 - mark sweet
I'm going to talk to you about making sure that we're only leaving pending contact when we haven't talked to them.
00:19:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So Eric is saying that that's what's happening. They are leaving them in pending contact. So we just got to, I'll double check it all, but then it just might be, hey, if you're working a lead, you got to move it over and then it would be 96, then we'd come up with the different rules. So it'd be 96 hours in pending and then from working, but maybe we're not.
00:20:00 - mark sweet
we never move them. Yeah, as long as it's working, then we don't need to move it because that means we've gotten.
00:20:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. He's saying that's the problem. They are not moving it.
00:20:10 - mark sweet
Okay, I will talk calling people that your entity team is already working with because of this. Okay, got it. And so they're like, well, she's not there.
00:20:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. um, No, I ran it down. So Patty's back from vacation. She hasn't left with the baby yet. When she leaves, it's going to be six months. I don't think that I wrote down when she's leaving.
00:21:03 - mark sweet
Two weeks.
00:21:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the same thing. Okay. When that's that. Like 24 or something.
00:21:17 - mark sweet
Basically, I'm on.
00:21:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Another month. Okay. So, um, did you guys work on the intake script?
00:21:28 - mark sweet
And we're going to meet today to go through it a little bit more.
00:21:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's the level of progress? Do you think out of like?
00:21:45 - mark sweet
closer. I just, they have the basics of the script. I just want to work on our. Objections, I guess.
00:21:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's important. Good afternoon. Anything that's a friction point should, like, you want to thoroughly, basically create as many guardrails as possible that your team can recognize, oh, this is the friction point, this is the trigger, therefore this is the response or the way that I need to handle it, and then, like, if they're not really good at doing it consistently, maybe some type of role play activity, because call control and call flow is, you can't script everything, but that practice and that immediate feedback of, okay, this is how you should handle that, this is how you should handle that, creates this muscle memory, but also creates confidence that they may not. don't have in dealing with something, because there's so many different things to process, the person on the other end, energy, their tone, what experience they had, your person, the mood that they're in, all these different things. So you want to try to make things as reflexive as possible where they don't even have to think about it. They know how to recognize this situation gets this response so that it just becomes habit and reflex. But you want everybody to have the same reflexes and obviously there's a, there's skill, you know, there won't be perfect consistency across the board, but it can be engineered to be probably a lot better, but I haven't listened to the calls. I actually keep reminding myself to do that. have to log into lead flow, but I don't have a lead flow rate access yet, I think. is my issue. Hold on a second, let me check. Dan, that's what it's called, right? Lead slowly, that's what I would look at, login security code. I did get that. Okay, I care to login. Okay, so that's what I want to do so that I can kind of add some feedback to that. Because managing call flow is something I've had lot of training and experience and it's been a long time in the corporate world, but it all, it's all the same for the most part.
00:24:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay, it is all the same.
00:24:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, people being people. Okay, you guys are working on that. Do you have anybody on the NTA team that, I mean, when's last time you listened to NTA calls?
00:24:54 - mark sweet
Well, I mean, I'll go and sit and listen to them, but to actually like to sit and go through the recording step by step is going to walk.
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wanna buy a while? Six months. Okay, that's not that bad.
00:25:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's been a year for me.
00:25:13 - mark sweet
Because it was like December, January that I got ticked off and that's where it's been about six months. Right. when it comes to my digging instead.
00:25:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me go back. Where do I have the intake team written down? Used.
00:25:30 - mark sweet
Oh, so just the sort of an FYI will pass these out. splitting our role in two.
00:25:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you told us that last week. I got that.
00:25:40 - mark sweet
Feel comfortable with that at least.
00:25:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is good. Between I wrote it down, I just looked at it. So, but yeah. Um, so who, who, oh, I'm Maria Mia. Who is there anybody else besides those, those two want to take?
00:26:07 - mark sweet
That are going to be running it now.
00:26:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So they're running it for her. Okay.
00:26:15 - mark sweet
think we had a Zavato Marco, Jalissa Jose.
00:26:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What was the first name before Marco?
00:26:27 - mark sweet
A Zavato?
00:26:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A Zavato? Okay. And. How long? Let me see because I'm going to just go put this in my spreadsheet with the firm. Name this. This intake. How long has each one done working with you? Yeah.
00:26:54 - mark sweet
Uh, me has got to be on like here. Three or four at this point. Maria has been with us for at least a year. She's the only one with a college degree and she's a very detailed specific, so she's going to be good at breathing the biles. Jelissa's been with us for about a year and a half, she's going to law school next year. Jose has been with us for eight months, I think. Marco's been with us for close to a year. Is all those new? think he's on month three.
00:27:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, let's see. Marco was how long. As well, though. One three, you said.
00:27:53 - mark sweet
Yeah. Yeah, he knew.
00:28:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then Patty, and stay one. Right.
00:28:08 - mark sweet
No.
00:28:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No.
00:28:14 - mark sweet
She's been around since 2019.
00:28:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, let's see what's. So, I know when I last updated this. If you can rank them. Scale one to 10. How would you write each of them? One being the worst.
00:28:45 - mark sweet
Yep. or anything specific.
00:28:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, we could, we could write them according to certain data types. If that would mean the more information I have about them, the better. And the more ways that you're. evaluating them and looking at them the better.
00:29:03 - mark sweet
Yeah, so let's use Jose because he's kind of the most polarizing one. Okay, he's very good at closing on the phone, but he is not reliable, not detail oriented, and can't rely a lot. The next one, let's go to Jalissa. She's smart, but she's just here for a paycheck now and she's going to law school. So she does her job, she doesn't do anything beyond her job. She's mid-level, I guess I would say. She understands what to ask and kind of understands what clients are doing, but not around for a long time so she knows what she's looking for and she's developing a pretty good gut of like what cases to take which ones not to take which is good. Still needs work to help though on closing cases. Azvaldo is new so he's still just trying to make sure he figures out you know what we're doing. Not a slight on him it just takes time of course. But he wants to learn he wants to listen to calls so he's you're going learn to get better. Marco is like a B plus decently on closing cases could be a little bit more aggressive on the phone and a little bit of a lack of detail. And then Patsy I think we kind of all know where she's at. Again I think she's a little weak on closing cases but she's pretty good on what's taking what not to do. And then Maria is only one I forgot. Maria is very detail-orienting, weak on the phone or weaker on the phone, I should say. She's much more about order taker.
00:31:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Now you know who's calls to listen to Tina, and in what order? Although, actually, you can't tell who's remembering.
00:31:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You to learn their voices. I'm pretty good at that. Let's see. Okay, so you gave me those details, which are really great, but now I would like you just to write them overall scale of one to 10. Go Patsy first. Let's give her a seven. Maria.
00:32:00 - mark sweet
Five.
00:32:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:32:04 - mark sweet
Six.
00:32:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Jelissa. Five. Jose.
00:32:15 - mark sweet
He's anywhere between the two and a thing.
00:32:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I really do. think on the day.
00:32:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know.
00:32:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
depends if he's had a snack or not.
00:32:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my god. Does he show up You might want to include that information. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Part is to replace and take people by the way that we've had this conversation but it's been a while.
00:32:53 - mark sweet
They get burned out.
00:32:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
really don't want to do it. Yeah. Okay. Marco. Hello.
00:33:02 - mark sweet
Marco, I would say six and a half.
00:33:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, although it's still new, but let's rank him as a newbie. As far as like previous new people.
00:33:20 - mark sweet
I mean, if I got to just put him on a scale, I put him at a, you know, a four. I think knowing that he's new, I would put him closer to, you know, the sixth, seven range. I think he could be the long term.
00:33:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For six. That's, that's good. No, wait that. Um, whoa. Hate when I click on something and Excel about like disappears. I'll use my place.
00:33:50 - mark sweet
Right. But obviously those are, yeah, some swings there.
00:33:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Okay, I'll just ponder that for a while, because that's the only thing that my brain can do right now, and that would be not a fun conversation, because I wouldn't be talking, I would just be thinking. Okay, I'm going to think about that. Let's see.
00:34:18 - mark sweet
They're highly incentivized at their goals so they're definitely motivated that way, but the one thing I do like about them is, they don't try to twist cases to try to design it just to try to have a goal.
00:34:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good.
00:34:41 - mark sweet
But their incentive is all tied to each other right so it's a team goal because when we try to do individual night, it became problematic of who signed what because look at the people talked to a client. So it just, it was just better to do a team goal. It cuts down on. on the issues significantly.
00:35:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there, and this is just things to contemplate for maybe some kind of separation and reward for individual performance, like even just, and because I have to think about how we can do this, obviously the HR rules and the things that you can specify and can't, but just punctuality, like is there anybody that's chronically late or leaves early or not back from lunch on time, things like that where you can, rather than penalize, just reward people for never being that or that type of Yeah, I honestly don't dig into that as much as I should.
00:35:55 - mark sweet
They're generally there when we're supposed to be within five or 10 minutes. So the only one that we've got issues with this goes in.
00:36:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So do they, they're not salary that early, right?
00:36:19 - mark sweet
So they, they log in. Correct, except pass it.
00:36:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Do you ever look at their login reports?
00:36:29 - mark sweet
No. I mean, they come in, they have to scan their thumb. So I know when they're here, but, you know.
00:36:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you've never reviewed their login reports.
00:36:39 - mark sweet
Only if there's an issue, then you should bring it up to me. And Patsy is pretty good at telling it that someone's got an issue.
00:36:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then do they stay in the same state all day? it just either like a time card like you're here? And not here, or do they have break periods where they, um, um. Like if they're going to lunch, do they log out for lunch? What's that with like?
00:37:04 - mark sweet
Yeah, no, it's regular hourly. So at the end, clock out for lunch, come back, clock back in, 14 minutes.
00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And paid breaks are not a separate anything. It's just going break and tell somebody, like, how does that work, too, for breaks?
00:37:21 - mark sweet
They just have their 10 minute breaks.
00:37:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And nobody's looking to see if 10 minute breaks turn into 30 minute breaks or 40 minute breaks.
00:37:34 - mark sweet
No, again, if there was an issue, well, it's your path to say something to me.
00:37:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I hear that. But I hear about it. Well, and define issue and define does Patsy even want to deal with it? Like, let's say it's, what does it say to me? Hold on, it's the, yeah, it's the drunk. Good. Right.
00:38:01 - mark sweet
That's definitely more than annoyed.
00:38:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so any, but attention to detail and even caring about things, you know, it's, so what gets on path to these radar, for example, is the only thing that's on a radar is, hey, there's calls and nobody's answering them. Now I'm going to look around and see what people are doing, or is she in the habit of looking around and saying what people are doing. So to the point of the quality of team and who's showing up and being active and doing things, especially if they're all getting the same incentive, which totally with that type of behavior seems wildly unfair and demotivating, which is why you have to catch other things that you can reward if you can't separate this type of thing. But, but is, you know like if I show up and I'm on time every single day and I never go over all my breaks or rarely right and I am not abusing time and I'm showing up and I'm doing a good job and maybe I'm not the best person but I try my best and then there's this drunk that comes I gotta watch my mouth but that comes in and he's late and he's belligerent or rude or lying or whatever and like we're all getting the same reward and like nobody cares that he's just screwing around because he does it one more slow so like nobody's noticing but he's just hanging out like I'd be annoyed so um dealing with something because there's an issue is not high level leadership and management do you know what I mean that that's reactive is anybody paying attention and trying to optimize things like just the way people show up and act and and how they punch in and whatnot and I don't know what level you at that to me. It's not micromanaging. It's just understanding. It's inventory, right? Human resources are part of your business. And you've got an entire team of six, seven people here that nobody's paying close attention to. It's passing listening to their calls regularly.
00:40:22 - mark sweet
I got it.
00:40:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so there's like no quality control here in solid leadership or management on team of seven. That's a huge thing. Yeah. So, you know, we're really starting to get a lot of other things. Either under control or we're building a framework around it to to kind of, you know, putting the guardrails, putting the framework in and taking a look at it. intake, from the beginning when we've asked questions, it's just been kind of like like it is what it is, type, answer and response.
00:41:04 - mark sweet
It's hard to find people to work it and not to burn down for sure, but it definitely needs improvement.
00:41:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and I feel like we're at a point now because we go in cycles, right? Where sometimes our calls are super focused on one particular thing and we're fleshing it out and like we end the call and there's still lots of stuff to talk about. And then there's periods where like there's not a ton because it's all getting worked on and this is one of those periods where we've got room to be talking about other things and digging into it a little. It is a frustrating thing and it's going to take some extraction and we're gonna have to work hard to figure out what we can do because of the nature of it. But if you're willing to just kind of wrestle with us a little bit and try to figure out what we can do. I think that it's a critical part of your business and it deserves that effort. Even if it's not clear and there's no clear path, I would like us to be spending a little more time working on it. I do think now is a good time to do it. Now isn't like not just today, but like, you know, maybe for the next few months.
00:42:24 - mark sweet
Yeah, no, I agree.
00:42:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. I think if you get a script in place, right? All the calls I listen to, all of them were way too long because they didn't pre-qualify the person when they got on the call. So burnout. I could see burnout coming from. Oh my God. have to listen to this person recount this accident that has no me, no purpose with me being on the phone. That would drive me nuts. But it's there. it's the process is what's causing that. It's like that that that would get eliminated. So if that's a factor, that fact can get eliminated.
00:43:08 - mark sweet
So somewhat, I mean, they get a lot of abuse, and unfortunately, too, you know, only tell people that we can.
00:43:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah, I see some of comments.
00:43:16 - mark sweet
Yeah, so, you know, that's an unfortunate part of what we do. And that's just that's been ever going to take up in part of like, that's just the nature of the people or else. Sometimes you can't change that.
00:43:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can't, but you can't train and help your team know how to handle that. Has that been done? Like, I know we did black, you have black phones. I don't know how helpful it was with that. And you've also had grief counseling, but what kind of training has your team had in terms of dealing with and redirecting difficult people on the phone?
00:43:59 - mark sweet
Just the black. on stuff. And then again, giving them solutions. You know, I'm sorry, we can't help you, but here's a place you can go to, which is really the state bar website for, you know, from there. So at least try to help them in some way, shape or form of at least to go to.
00:44:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:44:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Maybe you could turn it into a positive and be like, all right, Karen, call it the month award goes to so-and-so. Oh, I got the best one. I got the best . You're like, great, you get a new withstanding money.
00:44:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, we could just get a trophy that I turned that frown upside down.
00:44:50 - mark sweet
Don't use the trophy with a big butt on it or something. Like, you got the, you talk to the forward.
00:44:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Instead of the talking.
00:45:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, there are, there are soft skills.
00:45:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You get the plushy.
00:45:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And our soft skills, sometimes it can be learned and people can be empowered, which is respectful and erupting. And it doesn't always happen. But first of all, it starts with a frame of mind of just knowing, look, this, this is a thing that has to happen and that you're not being rude by coming somebody else, because the whole point of why they called is to get help with what they want. Occasionally, maybe you have somebody calling just because they want to complain and they're angry or they're lonely, I suppose that's possible too, because any type of dealing with the public, you're going to get some of that. But for the most part, the person called because they had a goal to accomplish. And if the intake person keeps that in mind, this person called me because they have a goal in mind. My job is to help them accomplish that goal and also to remind them because they're, they're going to be emotional and they're going to be distracting. did once they start talking about things that they had a goal in mind. Your goal is you got an accident and you want to get help for it. So the problem is the things that you're telling me right now are preventing me from helping you accomplish that goal. So if you don't mind, let me pause you there. I'm going to ask you this question and then oftentimes even belligerent people will be redirected. Now, if you ask them that multiple times, you can empower your people and say, look, sir, I've asked you three times for this. I really need this to be able to help you. If you're not ready to talk about that, I totally understand. How would you call us back when you want to discuss it or something like that? I don't know that you can do that, but my point is that there are things that can be trained and processes and you have to kind of weigh like what's it going to cost you? Obviously, there's a game to play and you can't be just getting rid of any difficult people. But I don't know, and I will listen to some of the calls, which I'm kind of dreading because that's probably going to be hours of time to really go and do that well. But to see what kind of skills they have, are people able to pause, professionally interrupt, redirect, refocus, because from what I've heard from Dan, that probably isn't happening really well. So anyway, just going through this, even if it's again 5%, 10% improvement, and maybe the improvement is not only on how long the calls take, but also reducing stress for your team. If this is a high burnout job, you know, if Sweet Law could be a place where you, people, your intake team is like, I don't want to go work anywhere else because I've been trained this. I've been. empowered to handle calls this particular way. I'm supported by getting a good intake script. We're not overly busy, like we're not just slammed with calls constantly and understaffed so that they can maximize money. Like all these different things that go into it and, you know, looking back a year from now, going, wow, you know, that's just a little bit of improvement, but I noticed it. And here's how it's reflected in the numbers. And here's how it's reflected on the team. And then we start the compounding effect of, you know, now Mia's been here six years and she's even better at this. And when we have to hire somebody new, we've got a better person to train and that type of thing. So it's like everything else. Like it's small, it seems like it's not going to make a big impact. And then you look back and you go, that was helpful. So in a very critical portion of the business. So anyway, I think you should go back and listen to some calls too if you have some downtime just maybe if you could sample a few calls from each person so that you've got something fresh in your head so that we can come back and discuss it would be good what do you think about that yeah no I need to and when do you have time for that time it's just it's one of those you need to make time we need time yeah what I'm asking is because I'd almost rather have a tooth pull and go do that maybe we just end up spending a call doing it together I don't know but um I want to be prepared when you start let's um maybe listen to it on the airplane traveling okay all right um so we'll try to discuss need to And our login report, something that you could share with me.
00:50:14 - mark sweet
Um, I have to, Isaac would be the one who would have to pull those.
00:50:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, let me send you an email and just see, um, I'll see the Isaac. And that way all you have to do is say yes or no. So, okay. Yep. I'm going to make one. Okay. Uh, what, what was that? That came.
00:51:02 - mark sweet
I'm just going to ask a bit of answer.
00:51:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, cool. I played that last. And I'll just shoot this off. All right. Oh, go back and take some files. Morning meditation. Um, Dan, you had something. Yeah. Did you send that to Mark?
00:51:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, no.
00:51:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You want to tell them what it is?
00:51:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yoga nidra. Are you doing yoga nidra? You should try yoga nidra.
00:51:45 - mark sweet
You should try yoga nidra.
00:51:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The yoga nidra, it's not really yoga, but it's a meditation that you do. part of it is that you set an intention, which is interesting. But you're, it's like you got more sleep when you're done with it. It takes 20 minutes and it's a little weird because you're, you're just laying down and it's, it's, um, dive in so they're like, do this. They're basically having you go through your whole body while you're doing it, like focus on different parts of your body. then at the end, it's like they do some at the end or whatever. But when you open your eyes after it, it's, you're altered, you're altered. You're like, whoa, you feel way more energized. It's like getting more sleep. I mean, that's, I picked it up from, um, Andrew Huberman, who's this book in biohacker dude. And he thought, he thought it was BS and then he started doing it. He's like, Oh my God, it's like to make a difference. And I think they studied when they're like, yeah, people are changed by doing it. The ultimate test. though was when our little friend Salco called me and he was like flipping out and he's like, dude, he's complaining about something. go, you need to try yoga, and he's like, what the hell is that? And I explained to him, he's like, I'm not going to do that. And I said, well, then whatever. I'll send it to you anyway. And I said to him, and then three days later, he's like, dude, he was so freaking out about something. He's like, I did it while I was in the So he legged out the airport and didn't, because I felt amazing.
00:53:30 - mark sweet
Like, told you, he also got facing the airport.
00:53:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But yeah, that's the difference. That's the difference. That's called, that's called Drumka Nidra.
00:53:40 - mark sweet
It's different. Yeah, no, I'm looking at my text messages from while in the airport, which are not appropriate for this conversation in any way, shape or form.
00:53:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, this is new.
00:53:50 - mark sweet
Mine was a while ago.
00:53:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, he said he had COVID.
00:53:55 - mark sweet
He's got a COVID hangover. Because this was stampede was here this weekend. There's four groups of six Plus women who would all be quote unquote rodeos.
00:54:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, boy.
00:54:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:54:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I think it was seven is flossing at the table.
00:54:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, lovely.
00:54:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Like literally.
00:54:18 - mark sweet
No. Center for you. There's no rules. You want to drink margarita?
00:54:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
are no rules.
00:54:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. Um, so the point was that we were discussing it, talking about, um, morning, you were talking about morning meditations last week. And so Dan was like, Oh yeah, I've been, I did this thing. He should do this. And so I wanted to remember to see if he told you that.
00:54:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's a joke right now. So one minute.
00:54:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right.
00:54:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
If you don't follow Andrew Huberman, like all of his things. Yeah, he's. Yeah. all of these things are great. Getting up and going out in the sun and doing all that stuff.
00:55:06 - mark sweet
So one of the people I work with told me this and this actually makes a lot of sense that negative emotions are used to avoid your responsibilities. many times someone's like acting out or there's a negative emotion tied to something because they're trying to avoid some kind of responsibility.
00:55:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Sure, that ties in with like the whole self-fulfilling prophecy and concept which is absolutely beautiful.
00:55:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Interesting. I will say though that while I've been working on my psychology degree and it's interesting doing it at this age and the stage in life as a parent and having gone through other things that I've gone through because when I first went to school, you know when you're when you're young, you're institutionalized, you're trained. that the teachers know everything, adults know everything, and that the people that write the books know everything and that they are the and all be all authority. And I know better than that now. So going through school, but what's interesting to me is some of the books have the textbooks have said, look, this is in the book because the book had to be created, but we couldn't even agree on this stuff. It's here because this was the general consensus, but a lot of us disagree. We disagree with the, you know, the main book. Do you see it? Why can't I even think about it right now, my gosh? Anyway, but for every scientist that will tell you one thing, there will be two that disagree with them. And so that is why, too, I think that it's so important that we take the notes and, and I don't know, explore and have our own experience. I've been taking sunshine breaks for like, I don't know, 15 years. It is crazy. I sleep better. get at least 15 minutes of sun. As Fuji already told him, he needs to start writing that down, but it's wild, all of these things. There's more to try and learn than we'll ever even have time to in our lives. But if we can find back to leverage, if we can find the levers that make a significant impact, it doesn't matter if you know all the things and do all the things and we're not disciplined anyway enough to do all the things consistently, but figuring out what our Kryptonites are, what are the things, what are our coping mechanisms, what are our defense mechanisms, what are the things that we use to avoid whatever, kind of paying attention to that and create the system.
00:57:55 - mark sweet
Did I have you read switch, Mark?
00:57:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. You know what I did. pay attention to and I didn't notice that Fuji pointed out today was that that you creating the path so and this is it was just different language but I didn't realize it was in there it's what I do anyway but to the point of like we have finite willpower you can only wrestle with so many things each day so if it's a Russell to get up in the morning at a particular time if it's a wrestle to not check email if it's a wrestle to not snap but somebody that annoys the heck out of you but to wrestle to choose good food choices if it's a wrestle to you know what mean like all these different things that we have to kind of fight with ourselves to do or convince ourselves to do put forth this willpower to will ourselves to do something that we don't actually really want to do right we know that we should but we don't it's not it's not naturally what we want to do but we only have so much of that in ourselves each day. the goal then is to craft the environment where choice and will isn't necessary because there's no other options. I don't have to ask myself if I'm going to have a cookie for breakfast if there aren't cookies in the house. So I created the path a little bit differently so that I can't wander into the cookies in the morning.
00:59:24 - mark sweet
Do you know what I mean?
00:59:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But anyway, just so finding the things that make the biggest impact and then setting up our environment in such a way that the things that negatively impact us throughout the day are not in our environment so that they have less opportunity to impact us negatively which means that we've got more energy which by the way the other thing was is that it affects our cognitive ability. So every time we have to use an employee willpower to tell ourselves to do the thing we don't want to do. or not do the thing that we want to do, we have less patience and ability to even solve, let's say it's a mathematical problem. Let's say it's a business problem, a system problem, hiring problem, whatever. have finite mental resources, which is obvious, right? But to understand that we can create the environment in such a way that it optimizes our day by reducing and minimizing the rest souls that we have to have that evoke, invoke, invoke, will power. Anyway, yeah, so just one on hand. There you go.
01:00:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You got to bounce. I got to go drop the car off, get new tires.
01:00:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have fun.
01:00:52 - mark sweet
task. My two cents, just get whatever cost it's going to charge you and wherever you're going, make them match it, because they always will, but they'll grumble about it, but I'll save you a bunch of books.
01:01:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Alrighty. It's possible to not have the ones I wanted, but I will do that. Just right. Also, we need to meet with Patsy's husband still. Go ahead and work on that. Thanks, Black. Yep. mean, yeah. Whatever. Someone's husband. Good job.
01:01:17 - mark sweet
Okay.
01:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you taking care of yourself?
01:01:23 - mark sweet
Yeah.
01:01:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you just say occasionally?
01:01:29 - mark sweet
Uh, yeah.
01:01:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Alright, um, how's Ronan?
01:01:37 - mark sweet
Uh, adorable, but shoot up my mom's hat. So, but it's a puppy.
01:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, this is gonna happen. don't know what she's expecting. For a couple of years, it's gonna happen.
01:01:47 - mark sweet
Yeah, but he's adorable, which is good.
01:01:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is he still coming to the office?
01:01:53 - mark sweet
Uh, occasionally. How is your mama? Um, we've had to deal with a lot of dads. stuff so it's just been a little hard not and you know none of this is a straight border easy unfortunately so now kind of pulling back well um I went to the fight the Nate Diaz fight which was fun on saturday oh yeah throw that with whole bunch of guys so that was fun to do um one of the guys filled this way with like their family's multi-billionaires which you know it's just always interesting to see people at those high high high levels but it's still the same stuff systems and processes and people like it's just on a bigger scale um send me this one thing because it cracks me up I was on the phone I was walking back and forth on our second floor and the squirrel just comes in just like lays down on top of the roof like he's just chilling and it just probably just find it mildly funny as well but yeah it's awesome
01:03:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And me and the pool for the last two days. I'm just like, I'm not doing anything. love sun. That's why I need to be living in Arizona.
01:03:11 - mark sweet
Monday is a big day next week. So the $10 million check case should be done because they have to give it to us by the 14th. So I get it that Monday. And then I got my personal million dollar cases due on that Monday, so don't. Kind of exciting.
01:03:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is fun. So to the, you going out and hanging out with friends, I will say that one of the best things that I think anybody could do, especially through different seasons of life is actively cultivate friendships and different types, just different people and socializing and along with the stuff that you're. going through, personally, at home, with mom and everything else. Just having people who know you, who are aware of you, laughing, laughing is really, really important. Having fun, having people that are maybe in similar seasons, but also who are where you want to be. Just thinking about those, but being really intentional about making those times, making time for that, and reaching out to make those connections proactively not worrying about whether or not somebody else initiates it or not waiting for anything, but just being really intentional is I think one of the best tools and one of the best hedges, rather than a lever, it's a hedge against depression, it's a hedge against just kind of sinking. Because there's so many different things that can come up in life, and so I hope that you do lots more of that. It's good for you, and you people love you. You're a good guy, and people need you too. So that's my pitch. think that you should spend more time making friends and having fun and letting people fall in love with you. Yeah.
01:05:27 - mark sweet
Yeah, no, it's good. On the up side.
01:05:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
On the what side?
01:05:32 - mark sweet
Yeah, it doesn't make you mild entertain. So we got to start out from my old law firm. And super well, what? Because it's a case that we'd already settled. So I basically say like, no attorney who signed this. So I'm not sure who to address the letter to. Obviously, I know the wrong law firm. But we've already settled the case. the policy limits. Despite, you know, fact that. I called the collision, I think, previous owner for teaching me how to turn lemons in the lemonade on these types of cases. And I used to say, so we're going to certainly send the file, and we're just going to finally need to be starting our full attorneys fees. The response I got back was, it was newly retained on our, and we'll drop. thought it could be a assistance in your training. Obviously, I would have made a different decision knowing what I learned discovery years ago regarding your employment by our firm. But that is your karma, you must work out and I'm happy I'm on the other end.
01:06:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What?
01:06:33 - mark sweet
Yeah, I don't know exactly what that means.
01:06:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
01:06:40 - mark sweet
So I asked my old boss, I was like, hey, do you have any clue what the hell she's talking about? Because there's, when they got raided in the DA got involved, that was bad. And then they sued each other when they ended. So I didn't know which discovery it was. Like I read it four times, I have no idea. So I'm sure I said something at some point. point is again the reason I learned lot what I learned was because she didn't show up or she was too intoxicated or whatever. She was in a meeting to just choke drunk or high. So I took a lot of meetings and met a lot of people that I wouldn't otherwise meet because of that so it worked well but not directly if that makes sense.
01:07:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So she was bitter and deflecting and she is bitter and deflecting.
01:07:27 - mark sweet
I'm sure I said something about it and you know at some point that of frustration whatever else and there's no excuse but more than sure I said something and so it was interesting. I tried to make friends with her when I left and she said it doesn't work that way and yeah.
01:07:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well whenever life is lessons and some of them really really suck but some are really really awesome. So yin and yang I'm telling you it doesn't matter like how good things get equal opposites will happen. So the better it It gets in some ways, the worse it gets and not necessarily directly, maybe it's just like the people around you, but it's it's kind of wild to notice. But I've learned that the the fortifying power of the good is that you can see the bad happening around you, but it is less impactful. And it it it doesn't create the pain that it could have the potential to create when you fill yourself up with so much goodness. And that's been interesting and fascinating to watch too that that that bad has less power to do its thing, you know.
01:08:44 - mark sweet
Yeah, it doesn't really bother me. It's just a little strong with people.
01:08:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, there's a lot of that all day long. What is wrong with you?
01:08:54 - mark sweet
Anyway, I got to deal with the angry, dead client person action.
01:08:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will talk to you later. Have a good day. I'm Mark. know you. Yep.

Hey, hey, how are you?
00:00:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Good. me just grab a glass of water. just realized I don't have that for saw my desk.
00:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hold on.
00:00:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Do you have a fabulous weekend?
00:00:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I did.
00:00:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yay.
00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I needed it.
00:00:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, good. All right, my water.
00:00:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm already looking at flight for next time.
00:00:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Alexa, stop. Okay. So I was hoping we can just open up a Google Doc and just knock out details of the offer. Yeah. And then, um, I don't want show your screen or my screen, but I didn't want to show you one quick thing. I just put together. they're like over the weekend just finalizing it now. This is what I put together. She had this is one of the two gay clients. And she sells ADHD stuff for kids, but also this child custody binder, that's why she was taking a long time to decide what niche to go after. So we're starting to after this one and the whole parenting niche. But I'm really proud of this.
00:01:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This looks awesome. Very good.
00:01:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Anyhoozy. So yeah, so pretty proud of that.
00:01:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah. That's awesome.
00:01:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
she happy? Oh yeah, she she's I'm very careful with her what she spends because she's like really been through a lot and doesn't have a lot of money. So I'm always helping her above and beyond. Without a doubt. But yeah, she's happy with everything. Whenever she gets on a call of me, or if I help her something on her Shopify e-commerce store, she makes money. And unfortunately, one time she had someone else help her for ads, and then the ads went tagged after that. So, but literally, she's someone who only has like a budget to spend like $25 then ads. Like, that's it. That's why I'm saying I go slow with her.
00:02:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but yeah, she's, she's happy.
00:02:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
My biggest issues, I really don't want her to spend a lot of money on tech stack. So I'm probably going to transfer this. That's what's been taking me the long time. I think I'm just going to transfer this to system I owe for her because it's so much cheaper than anything else. And has email, everything. But I'm just going to tell her, I thought I would do it. screw it. Like, I'm just going to tell her to hire someone for $50 to recreate it in System I owe because I was trying to do it a little bit on the weekend, but learning new technology, even though I like System I owe, I think it's really good. And there's another woman that that big Facebook group that that that that lady runs digital wealth, whatever, she teaches them System I owe as well. She's got a really a business model. Do you want me to do this? Give it to you in a nutshell. know we're supposed to do this for nine. Okay, so $47 I'm in the thing and she's teaching a lot about social media, building organic growth, but very, very emotionally positive mindset stuff in there, which I think is really good for lot of people. Like it's almost like this is kind of maybe the end result what we want. So I'm like, holy cow, this is good. But what she does is anyone who buys, she has a regular opt-in how to make money online, start a business online webinar, and then sells her courses, which she whitelables to you. So for $900 at the end of the web or if you buy it, you get her whole funnels and Kooloo Testimals everything and the ability to resell her stuff. And the training is really in-depth about how to take it inside. System IO is the choice that they use because it can have the whole course in there and everything. And there's crazy amount of testimonials that people Then all she needs to teach someone, because think about it, she's simplified, starting on business from the complex to just simple, where you're just focusing on branding and traffic, social organic traffic, you could use ads too. And you don't have to now worry about delivery, because you have a proven product that's actually high values. It's not crap. know, like some other people sell licensing stuff too. And then if one chooses to then create their own digital products, they've already then locked in, locked in, how to do traffic and have a personal brand and the list, your own list.
00:04:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What? What was her domain?
00:04:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let me share a screen again. I don't know what her domain is for selling the 900. I could probably find out if I dig or into it.
00:04:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've been trying to say to be different digital wealth, like academies and- Yeah. It's digital growth academy, but- growth.
00:04:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But this is only the 47 a month, right? This isn't selling the 900 thing. So, um, I don't know where in here, like I'm in the community in the classroom. That's the only thing that's weird. And like, she'll has Texas sport calls. Anyone who buys the $900 gets free access to this, I think membership. So, so everything that's in here, um, and she does this, you know, like 90 day success sprints day one day. Like, it's, it's really good. I mean, it's, it's something that, you know, you and I would create with full value transparency, giving value to people. Um, or we could just become, I was even thinking, just become a damn good affiliate for her because a lot of people are pursuing early, like she's gotten all these wins, like all these people making sales. She's got, look at all the pages of sales. What's that? sorry. I just had a funny message. She was like 18,000 and 32 pages of wins.
00:05:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Rosie, do you think it would be helpful if I join and pay for that? So that we're studying the same thing because here's the thing either we're creating our own path and just using it or That it will be what I do and we do it always should be but I Love modeling after somebody who's doing something similar to what we want to do and making a couple tweaks and I feel like if we're Number one it doesn't work with school to share logins or whatever and for the price. It's nominal Anyway, I'm just kind of study that and be on the same page Because it's low ticket because so you think that she's you know Telling the truth not really the bro marketer club.
00:06:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Just kind of She's definitely a bro marketer and you know who she hires in their dual mindset coaching is the same female mindset coach from LA That was on sunset that Netflix show sunset and I watched a little blurb of the mindset coaching. It's pretty good I think what amazes me to two things to you. What amazes me is Um, her, I'm just going to give this link to you. She's only been in this for two or three years and she was, I think, in network marketing and then she switched to this and one of her friends or colleagues, just like how you and I are connecting, one of her friends colleagues, it was a really good web funnels and tech stuff. So that's why they decided to create this because they figured that's what was missing. So I think she had a big boost from the start of all of her MLM people because this is so good for MLM people, right? To eat up and find another revenue source.
00:07:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know if we want to focus on such beginners. So that's my only thought process.
00:07:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like, so here's her Instagram thing that this is what her real thing is. So she calls it the free daily pay blueprint PDF, zero six, three or six months coming to here. So this is what she gives you. If you were to pay $900, you get this whole system as well. So you enter your email and then sends me the blueprint and then she's got this legacy build program and I think it goes into a webinar. And of course, she's, this is all in school, like, She just started the school community not long ago either, but she's just growing fast.
00:08:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you're probably one of those ones I kill it in network marketing and really, you got to talk to people a lot and you got to work a lot to do that. Oh yeah, I think is.
00:08:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Go ahead, sorry.
00:08:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's one of the things that is a big something I always want to pay attention to when I look at somebody and look out, why are they successful if they're successful because they're working constantly. It doesn't mean that I can't take what does work and then figure out how to make it work well or just set different goals. you know, maybe she's got 70,000, I don't need 70,000, 10,000, 5,000, 1,000, like, you know what I mean? It's a whole different level and also, I mean, how many people does she have to have to support the team? What kind of margins does she have?
00:08:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What kind of headache is all of that management?
00:08:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, they look good. All the different things and it gives It's exciting, you know, when you see these big platforms and these big numbers, but it's it's really easy to not take into account the cost of that and I'm sure you've done this as well. Worked with a lot of these people in the back end and they're just burnt out, they're happy on the outside and on the inside, everything else is falling apart, their health, they don't see their kids, they don't see their sweethearts, they, you know, there's a lot that you don't see and and the other thing is the difference between like extraverts, introverts and amberverts. I'm an ambervert, so, you know, like I can only spend so much time with a lot of people. I light up, I get energized, but then I'm super drained and I have to recover so I can't do that all the time and I'm not seeking out opportunities to be in front of people, but also if I spend too much time alone, I get depressed, introverts are like, let me be alone. Yes, I'm right there. I'm right there in the middle. Now, you have to take that into account with the business model. I would say I would think you lean more towards extrovert, but probably in the like, but so if here's a spectrum, here's introvert, here's ambivert. I mean, here's extrovert. Here's ambivert. would say Tina is probably right around here. Maria's maybe just a little bit over here, slightly more extroverted, but still probably doesn't need to be with all the people all the time. Yeah. Well, am I right or wrong?
00:10:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, no, totally. Totally. know, and I don't want to be a me too product. I'm going to be honest. Like, I think what we've been talking about, thinking about is really powerful and, and, you know, it was solidified even in my mind today when I saw Alan's post today about how in a nutshell, he just said all the people that he's helping. in his fast forward scale to like $100,000 months or whatever, $1,000,000 months, there's no more messaging of here's how to get five to five more clients, here's how to make more money. It's the messaging that really works is just having like that work, like work life balance, right? Which is what we've been talking about, right? And I believe in it, like a simple, anyways, we don't need to go into all details of that, but yeah, so don't buy it yet, you know, because we may not want to go that direction because sometimes what beginners deflates me because it's hard when someone comes back to you and says I only have like $20 a day to spend on ads.
00:11:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And actually, I think that that's not a bad budget for, for trying things down starts even our seven and eight figure clients with a dollar a day or to $5 a day at budgets and does well. But there's so many things that are an uphill battle for beginners. They don't have perspective and I don't I don't have the energy to want to impart low-level perspective, like the getting started perspective. I can give you impart the perspective of, all right, you've got all these great things, and you're doing all these great things, don't get psyched out and play smaller than you can be, but I don't want to be teaching the basics. I want to teach and offer that as a done for you, like just self-paced do it yourself. I want to teach it because I think that the way that I teach it is different than everybody else, and we'll resonate with the small group of people, and I just want to offer it and let God bring the people who need that, and it's its own thing. if I'm going to work one-on-one or in a group or anything else like that, I need it to be high-level, or at least mid-level, so for doing hybrid coaching, needs to be mid-level. We're experienced, we know a lot, We don't know it all, and we need some hand holding, but the group can kind of hand hold also, you know what I mean, that's that mid level. High level is, I just need you to catch me when I'm screwing up. Tell me the things that I don't know, and then I'm going to go off and do my thing, and I'm going come back and report, and then we're going to do this again.
00:13:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's high level.
00:13:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They don't need a lot of hand holding. I love those people. I barely talk to them. They're my favorite, and they adore me, and likewise, so for us, I think getting started really targeting that mid level person, where we can get some exponential kind of like results, some like raving fans of like, holy crap, you know, this was just, I've been here, here, here, here, here forever, and I just went, whoosh, but I did this without getting really stressed or trying to follow somebody else's thing that doesn't fit me. And that's what I want to deliver to people. And then what I want to do. as while we're doing this for people and making the money that we need to and want to, is figure out what did we do consistently with every single person?
00:14:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What was the process?
00:14:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What was the fundamental questions we asked? Which I mostly have out mapped out in my course that I started. But how could we improve that and so give that to people and then maybe we scale it up and we do a few more of these. Maybe we train some, because there's not enough of these people in the world, there's not enough high level coaches that are really good that can actually serve and take care of people. And so maybe we can train junior coaches or something like that who are really good at walking through this process that we've taught and completely outlined. And then maybe once we have a team meeting where we meet with all of our junior coaches and they say, here's the issue, here's where I'm getting stuck, or this is my plan. And what do you guys think, run it by us? Like, we could have a whole kind of school of ourselves. I've literally never thought this thought before ever. Yeah. So this is all just, it evolves, it evolves. It just keeps evolving. Because I'll tell you what happens. If we weren't talking, I would talk myself out of all of it. It was starting to do it.
00:15:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, no, no, that's why that's why I forced myself to launch a member of what it is. I said Tuesday at 6 p.m. So that's like girl in like five hours.
00:15:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And like, I don't really have much to launch.
00:15:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But I'm very good, I don't know you noticed this about me. I'm very good at teasing people and getting them excited. I've got people already saying, I marked my calendar for 6 p.m. But the thing is, here it is, go buy it for $100. This is going to be like, this is the price, take or leave it. But I have been torn between something that Josh Gavin actually said, because I'm in his little community, because he just called me in. And he's interviewed me about the success of how to float ticket offers. Hasn't be able to take it offers and I respect him, but he sometimes in his group. He's so cute He puts out somebody should do this offer and he'll just list out offers that you should do right like he says I'm too busy to do this. Someone should do this because I would buy this right or and so his latest one He says he says whether one or all of you do this go for it I thought that actually is brilliant He says someone should offer a pocket cmo offer Where for like whether it be 500 bucks a month or a thousand bucks a month or whatever a month You are the pocket cmo where they could twice a week or something Send an illume video to you about what their needs are like what they're stuck on and then you within like say a two day turnaround or 24 hour turnaround send a loom video back to them, right? he said for instance for him He would pay that for someone he doesn't want to hire someone like we're an agency for 5,000 months to run his ads or anything But he would love to if he's ever stuck or what to do share a screen and show someone something and then get the tips from someone else Um And I know my friend Cara who runs all the ads for like soon with Claire and she like paid herself I'm like, why did you do this? really good at what you do. I remember she paid $1,000 for one hour or one guy Who who proposed to be a Facebook ad scaling expert? And she said oh it like I knew more than him I'm like, what did you pay for the point is I thought that was interesting with our skill sets as well pocket CMO, you know And when I started I remember do you know who my kill is do you remember internet marketing? Super friends.
00:17:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, so Somebody people would always try to ask me to describe what I did and it was really hard because no role that I had found ever described it and then Matt Gill was a good friend. I don't know if you know him from nitro marketing Not that well, but I know him. He has a name Yeah, so he's like Ops you do operation. I'm like, yeah, that makes sense. So then I was like Okay, I'm COO for hire. now they have fractional COO. And I was like, yeah, that's that's definitely there. But that doesn't make enough money. I would not do it for anybody because they don't. It's not positioned and valued right for for the level that I do and brain. But I wish if like if you have that post, I'd love to see it because I'd love to send it to a client of mine who would be that that would be a great offer for him pocket CMO. He does the fractional CMO but I like the pocket CMO.
00:18:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
like that level of access because it's more leveraged.
00:18:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need to need this. I got to remember I got homework to do now schools in session. Um yeah anyway okay so let's see screen sharing our offer.
00:18:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Which you want me to share it or do you know yeah however yeah yeah. Okay.
00:19:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, was it the Maria Tina partnership one?
00:19:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know what? We have stuff in there, but I just created a new doc and it's not good. I don't even think I've shared it with you. So I'll just put it in the comments here now in the chat. And I will share screen right now. I have the other ones open too. Done. love it. But, you know, obviously starting to work less, have fun and have a life. And then do we just want to say one on one mentorship?
00:19:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Opportunity? Yeah. I love that. 20 plus year business veterans like, you know, how long have you been doing this? before I I did it online, which is 22 years. It was six years in corporate. And it was for a call center, but I was still managing metrics. And it was basically a business within a business, the call centers work. Because I did my own hiring. I did my own staffing. I did meet my metrics. I had to meet my contractual agreements. So in all of that actually prepared me for what I do. So I would say I'm closer to 28 years with business experience.
00:20:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I quit the big six consulting firms in 1999, 2000. So I guess 24 years.
00:20:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we're close. I would say nearly 50-year combines or we'll say 25 plus whatever. However you want to do that, it's close. Because if you want to be real about it, I also and you did too a paper route for a couple years and all the other things. So if you out of my business years, I've got 30 years under my belt for sure.
00:21:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:21:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow, that makes me old.
00:21:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Ha. ha ha And this is a mouse. Oops.
00:21:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it's that that let's break down full stock.
00:21:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Okay, for this. I just wanted to put this in before. Forget. Yeah, yeah. Because the feedback I'm getting from people that I did do some one in one calls with, by the way, I do have one in 15 minutes, so, but I get back on with you after that.
00:21:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, just, just, okay, this was only scheduled off till one 30 my time. So that's why someone snuck in and booked.
00:21:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's yeah. Yeah, but I'll be available in an hour after that two, three, my time.
00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm but anyway, you are not looking for money this meeting an hour long because that Tuesday.
00:22:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We have gone the whole weekend.
00:22:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, they have it.
00:22:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Action. I don't know. So yeah, we can go back to the full staff. Yeah. So this is what resonated with people when we were talking just back and forth about so many things to build on the business that you feel called to serve this component, but it'll give you emotional support, support, support, support. really, I think, resonated with people in the PS of the email that I sent a couple days ago, and then you saw some of my Facebook posts that are resonating with people. Maybe it's just cutting out what's in my Facebook post that I wrote on the weekend or Friday.
00:22:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The one I tagged you with. I don't know if you saw that one. I didn't even so.
00:23:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I quoted you in it too.
00:23:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was off. I was like, I'm not online at all.
00:23:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so this one, timeless principles for building a business and it's kind of summary of what we do and it says, what are my good friends to? Marie says, I take you on it. And it said, the offer match to the audience Trump's brand power all day, branding, just sports, organic traffic, so it was your words there because I wanted to slowly bring in you. But, yeah, so it's a long post, but I was talking about, you know, there's so much crap out there. And maybe I just can't pace this because people love this post. Yeah, you know.
00:23:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, let me, oh, go away. I've missed a lot, like apparently the swarms are terrible, and just...
00:24:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you want stop share?
00:24:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no, I just want to... I have my settings so that things that I'm tagged in don't... have to be approved to get on my wall, and like I'll still show up, but I wanted to do that. Go check this for you. Yeah, and then I can go... Wait, wait, that's not it. Oh yeah, no, sorry.
00:24:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, no words, no.
00:24:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Yeah, I see... I'll read it from here real quick so I can see all your... What do you call it? Words? please, but can I just get to my own profile? There, okay. Absolutely brilliant post. Nice job. thing you say, video or write means everything to me. Oh, good. So that's like, I may have heard a version of some of it when I when I hear it from me, it downloads directly from my brain, can't get enough. You have got to keep that as a testimonial and use that, Maria, because that's the thing. That's the type of comments and things that people say to me. This is what makes us most unique.
00:25:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What do you talk about?
00:25:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is a comment on here from Colleen held Ladwaib and she says, everything you say, video or write means everything to me. I totally get it, absorb it. And it's like, I may have heard a version of some of it. But when I hear it from you, it downloads directly to my brain, can't get enough. That is a skill that I have as well too. I that is so unique. I don't I don't know that that I've ever read read anybody say that about somebody else. I'm sure that it's there. I think like Alan and like there are certain types of people, we have, we connect with other ones. So you and I both do a little storytelling and correlating of a technical and tactical concept and put it into life in a way that people can just like go wait a minute, I get that now. You've got a, you are the class from the pulpit side. What we the teacher saw was someone without their ego, I'm gonna cry, getting in their way. You were there to learn all the questions they came at the right time. You followed instructions were first to finish the exercise, give me time to dig deeper. Those are really pioneering days of internet marketing.
00:26:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh yeah, that's my software friend. That's interesting too, but just he'll always couch it with edifying him. He'll never fully me. Oh yeah.
00:26:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm, that reminds me of Seth Laraby. Like he, You did a lot to lift people up, but you'd always be like, my student, my this, and I'm like, yeah, yeah, even teach what you're talking about. Like, he did that with me a couple of times. I'm like, you understand that this was not because of you.
00:27:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So yeah, yeah.
00:27:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, but yeah, okay, you know, I've been walking just you do such a good job of, I mean, even the emojis, the number emojis, I've never think of the number emojis.
00:27:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because sometimes it takes like two, three hours to write one post. So that's why I've been warming everyone up for the last 14 days too, to video post.
00:27:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love it. So, okay, what? Man, you've got to go soon.
00:27:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That sucks.
00:27:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is the best way to use this time to support where your brain has already been going because my brain can go off of on a whole different ten right now.
00:28:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think probably the stack. It's even happened in webinars. I'm so good at the whole webinars. I'm right when it comes to the pitch section of showing the stack or what they get. I fall short a little bit on bringing the power to that. So people convert because they know me. But maybe at the end of this document, I'm just going to say here's what's something like that. What's waiting for you or here's what you're going to get or something.
00:28:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:28:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:28:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Can I type in then you tweak because it works better for me? Yeah, that's how I thinking.
00:28:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Okay. whether you want to do it as a table or they just like, well, let me format it. Let me just bring dump.
00:28:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, for that work. Okay. a so first.
00:30:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love it.
00:30:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You You Whoa, sorry, sorry didn't do that. thought I could add it.
00:35:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, it shouldn't have done that. No, yeah, I was trying to add my own stuff at bottom, just to give you a If this helps from the post, if you talk, I'll lose what I'm saying.
00:37:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, you have a call.
00:37:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I got a dash. If you scroll down, I also put Josh's post in there in case there's any burby ash from there that you want to add about the pocket, CMO and CFO.
00:37:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nope. I don't want other people's rides. I just like, it was going to be fractional, but pocket was cool because boxers in the pocket.
00:37:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
no, I love it.
00:37:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:37:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All right. Talk a couple hours or yes, I have calls into like two o'clock and then I'll need a little break and then I have to get my daughter.
00:37:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm not sure, but let's at least box because traction got it. Okay. Cheers.

Well, I'm talking back to you realize mine was muted, and I know I unclicked it, but then I was in the wrong meeting, and so I forgot the second time.
00:00:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Can you hear me now? Dan? I hear you, I hear you. Hey, about now? Oh, I think I can do this. I hear you. Does that make it better or worse?
00:00:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you hear me?
00:00:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
nothing.
00:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is it doing nothing? I hear you.
00:00:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
hear you. wait. No, I can't do that. Well, that is a good work. Do... this.
00:01:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you hear me now?
00:01:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I totally just I was like, I'm just gonna turn up Bluetooth. I hit the right one. I meant to hit because I think when I'm in the office it bites between data and Wi-Fi.
00:01:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah, I hate what that happens.
00:01:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then but I think that ruins the connection somehow. Same thing when you're outside when I'm outside my house and it's connecting to both, I'm like, I think I killed a Wi-Fi.
00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I just and I and in my driveway I have to do that every single time. The back of my house is really good but that's because the router is much closer to it.
00:01:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. I'm just like, I will turn you up and the struggle will stop now. Mark hired me to work with China. What?
00:01:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Mark hired me.
00:01:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Left field? Yes. Well, it's probably kind of because his way of helping me, but getting something out of it too. So, but she, the business that she's working in is she's not there just as an employee. It's she gets a percentage of it. So, I mean, without crossing boundaries too much and talking about it. So, that, yeah, that. So, I'll start that next week.
00:02:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Nice. And this, what do you, what, she's working at this new job?
00:02:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I don't, I don't. Yeah. So, um, he, she's like, I don't know what he's like, you need a business coach because she basically has enough autonomy in what she's doing and has income potential besides just doing the job, right? So, their strategy involved and his introduction. in between the two of us is Tina will help you reach your goals even when you didn't know you had. That's very nice. And then listening to her, she just was stressed out, like I don't know anything and I'm like well let me break it down for you like this. I'll ask you all the questions and figure out how to make things less stressful and it will be all about you because she was like Mark has all these ideas and big and he's just go go go go and sometimes he comes down but mostly he's just got these big things and she's like I just... again just yeah but that's that's a for it's it's a first but also it was interesting because the new guy that he referred me to he's like my wife needs you i'm like i don't know that just makes me feel happy it's different it's very different i'm pretty sure it's very different not a normal stuff right totally but i've never been normal so there's that and i work with not normal so hey not normal right exactly um i yeah i'm really interested now i want to ask about um the what you call it the the plane like deal that he got going oh i don't really know the deep other than it's done i mean like the tax thing like i'm just fascinated with oh that was that was yeah yeah that was like this thing very deep deep into the trump that thing i vaguely recall
00:05:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Something about it, but you know obviously that's for a very and I remember you know people complaining about it's rich people So yeah, he leveraged that and It's a thing I know obviously it's only a thing probably for I think being out expired is pretty soon I was gonna say But once you're in you're in And then so who bought a jet Just because it almost sounded like doing it with somebody else This this is the part I don't remember and then Selco explained it to me. He's like no dude. He bought the jet and then places the jet with the company that rents the jet out Something like that, and then And then you You it's like it's sort of like the weird Those you're gonna live in if you're gonna do this if you're gonna live in Puerto Rico You have to be there six months of the year The rule for this thing is like you have to use the jail X amount of times per year Every year for the first five years for something like that And but the numbers very long. It's like you have to use it five times That's interesting and then it cat it cash flows positive cash flows 12 grand a month to mark How I mean nobody can be mad about that nope That's crazy. Well, he's playing all these big boy games now like dang dude, right?
00:06:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's Wow, Marcus just
00:07:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Conan leaps and bounds in all kinds of ways.
00:07:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's pretty amazing. Also, very much a reminder to not judge books by their E.R. covers. Uh, so, I mean, between that and like him hiring me for Chona, and then giving me Fuji, and then letting me work with his clients, like he is far and wide, just been amazing. And he's here because of you. So, I'm thinking I need to send another little gift basket, but I think that it should be something Denise gets part of, because she's the other D and D and D co. And she's losing her babies and making her happy makes you happy. So, what kind of thing could I do for Denise? Like what, like chocolate or bath bombs or something? Can I send a thank you gift to both of you?
00:08:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. I'll let you know.
00:08:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. You're so quiet.
00:08:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Again, Ariel. Really?
00:08:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:08:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
up the volume.
00:08:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I think part of it is your dynamic too, though, because like when you are part of it, part of it.
00:08:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, okay.
00:08:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. So you'll give me some ideas sometimes. Cool. Because especially with able and going, like, yeah. I've been thinking about this for a few months, actually. And I asked Daisy too. And she's like, yeah, she, I know she likes chocolate. So, but I'm like, I need to know more cause. Yeah. Um, all right. Let me go by too much. But I love my notes. Oh, so there is something. I'm not really sure what it looks like and how to create it, but I think I might have talked about it last week, but I'm zeroing in on a different type of dashboard that I want to create, which is kind of like a client profile. Um, talking about something for Mark. Um, yeah, for everybody out. Well, I, for me.
00:09:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm not not clarifying this, but that way. No, no, no, no, no. Okay.
00:09:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
measure all the things that are important and so like original goals that people have if I'm starting with them, so I can just kind of watch how they improve and track. And some of them will be financial, but some of them will just be, you know, how many hours in the office, although Mark spending a lot more than there. feel like that's actually. I mean, now, but he. wasn't and he wants to be able to not go into the office for a month or two if that's what he wants. And so anyway, but whatever people's goals are and just kind of tracking like the team goals, the revenue on top of it, but I don't so like I have all my notes for everybody, but I don't have it like I'd have to go through and remind myself what was what and I would like especially because I work with people for years to go okay this is what it was and you know the year we started and this was the next year and the next year and just kind of look at each of those things that we kind of touch on over time and just see how it's evolved but also how they've evolved because sometimes the the values change um like marks goals have gotten a little they've changed a little but they're more clear so like before it was I want to play because I want to play And then he added more things onto it and part of it became his dad wanted him to do this deal and It's kind of a thing between them like he would have taken his dad on it and But anyway, so we're just thinking about that, but I think that that would be a helpful thing and It has a multiple applications So like if we created something and I have no version to show you But there could be something like this for like mom for your artists and for any product Products you work with like okay in a very simple thing. It just be a spreadsheet There's no software needed for it because it's basically verbal extraction where we get this information in the first place in Terms of like where they're at and how they see themselves, but also the actual measurable data so we can report real data also And then you know where they are like so what was their fan base when they started with you and and what was their schedule like when they started with you? How often were they putting out songs? You know what I mean? Like all these different types of things that matter because so let's say a person is like this isn't working, well tell me how it's not working. So we really only have certain types of metrics like followers and like revenue, right? But there are other metrics that affect the metrics. So how often are you meeting with your band? How often are you writing and composing new songs? How often are you putting out new songs? How often are all these different types of things, right? And then they'll also see the correlation. So let's say you onboard somebody and you ask them these things. What's your schedule look like? What are you doing? know, what's your output, that type of stuff? And then as they are spending six months or a year with you and you're giving them systems, but part of the system is we're telling you you need to do the stuff consistently and so they just change their behavior. That behavioral change is a real value. It's not something that like you can see a direct relation and revenue but it may not happen right away but it's a real value and you can see the different things that happen as a result of it. Anyway, that's something I've been thinking about. What do you think? Any thoughts?
00:13:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So yes, I get it. I think that for you, well for anyone but for you, like yes it would be a totally different set of metrics for a band and for like a teeny client. But yeah, it totally makes sense. But so for you, it would be, I would think, that there's what you're trying to deliver to them through the coaching, right? is, you know, there's like whatever. Time for freedom up above whatever it is, whatever your metrics are, right? There's that's sort of the promise of working with Tina and getting on that whatever that name I said the other day, I love that name, the freedom, something formula, I was like, that's a good name.

I'm back, I'm right that down.
00:14:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's in the notes or it's in whatever I said to John, don't even know how I said to do, but so there's that and then there'd be like the play and I think is a bad example, right? It's like they need to be, they need to be.
00:14:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that was not ultimately on my brain about that should be there to find a name.
00:14:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so you have like time freedom and lower stress, whatever there, so let's say you have these five things or that and then freedom of the framework is what you had.
00:14:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah, there you go.
00:14:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I like that because it is literally what we've been talking about that you do, right?
00:14:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're like you get people freedom and they get fulfilled, right?
00:14:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And that how they were fulfilled, right? So So even if we just take that name, right? So the freedom is you're gonna have time freedom, freedom from stress, freedom from whatever, right? there's five metrics there that you provide, which if you think about it, you could be like, these are really good things to do. And then fulfillment is the personal. Hey, I want, I want, right? So it's almost this separation between rocks, right? The rocks are the top line of tina metrics. And then the personal goals are personal rocks, right? So there's the overall rocks and there's personal rocks. And you can measure those both over span of time and you could look at them quarterly, right? You can do that, but they're also running. So implementation lives, for me, it's super simple. You just make a gravity form that has, right? The metrics are set for the level one. And then level two, you'd make a dedicated gravity form them, right? You kinda like you're gonna have a hundred clients at this level, right? are the people. people that you're only working with at this mark level. maybe you have a dozen, whatever it is. So making an individual Gravity Form for them, which is really just a duplicate of the first one. So let's say you make one for Mark, then you make one for Dan, and Dan's personal stuff is slightly different. But it's a Gravity Form for each of these. You send it out once a week via sequence, and they fill it out, it goes, it goes out a G sheet, and then you build the dashboard in a G sheet. So the G sheets tab two, the dashboards tab one, or to Google Data Studio, right? And then you can say, well, this one looks like this quarter. And then you can open it up to six months, right? You can start to look at it over time, it should be when they first start out, hey, what is your stress level one to five? You just gotta figure out what the measurement metrics are gonna be like, zero to five, what's your stress? Zero to five, what's your time freedom, right? And then they just answer that every week. And then every week, you just add them to that data's date. And you just have a sequence that peppers them. Hey, you gotta fill this out. You gotta do it every week. That's the only catch is getting them to do it. But I think they will because it's super simple. It will work on an iPhone because it's like a single page with a single form. And yeah, that would be very easy to implement. And then get Melissa to get Melissa into a pretty dark.
00:17:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was not planning. I was not trying to tap into damn brain for myself. was just sharing something that we could find a way to use for you.
00:17:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
that was amazing. Yeah, I mean, I literally saw it while you were talking. I was like, oh, I know exactly how you built this. But I mean, it's actually really good because it does. It does give you a visual representation of what's happened. This is literally what you look like. This is what your pitiful light shirt looked like, you know, six months ago.
00:17:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they're right. So that's part of it. So I feel like sometimes, like for the glens types of the world, which I, you know, whatever, but, but sometimes even the, you know, my ideal people get caught up in this isn't working, this isn't doing anything. And even Mark was like, okay, we don't really need to keep doing this because, and I'm like, well, we did get results when you did the work, but you stopped and you weren't answering questions anymore. And you were punting all the time. And so he came back, but what I think it helps do is also create, first of all, accountability level, because if people stop kind of showing up and they don't mean not coming to calls, but just not doing the work, right, or they take a dip, that will show up there. But also when they, I think it helps them buy into the process. And because we've had to. Yeah. So I have created tiny versions of this sporadically, very sporadically, which is the thing I'm really working on trying to improve and really create like a system and kind of a schedule that is still applicable to people's individual pace. But it's like, okay, here's the signal, we're here, here's the thing and kind of go that way. But anyway, but which is just showing mark, okay, look, this is or even you sometimes everybody really at some point, just like, okay, here's where we were, here's where we are, here's what you did to get there. Let's not forget to do this thing and let's continue to do that thing and whatever. it will be in a, you know, first of all, it will happen regularly. Second of all, it will happen with more clarity and the biggest thing is it will be in that visual, like we really learned the power of showing people.
00:20:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
equal numbers and data in terms that they're familiar with because of frequency because we keep showing it right because we keep interacting with that data so it becomes much more familiar so there's less of a wait what is this wait what does that wait what does that mean and then look at it instantly and they're like oh yeah okay realigned recentered moving on and also just focus for like okay this is the thing that works more of the thing that works less of all the other stuff well it's also every week they'd be sort of passively visiting or revisiting their goals which they're never doing it's never they're never thinking about it they never sit down and go oh that's right i'm trying to have less stress this week right yeah so and then when they start grading themselves then it's going to be like i am not doing this where i am we're like i am i'm crushing them You know, and whatever it is like you might be like how's your time blocking going and they'll be like I Know that would be my answer terrible. It's going terrible.
00:21:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know I Don't love it. It matters right now.
00:21:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean I do really good on the Tuesday. Went that's absolutely true I do not answer the phone. I just do whatever I want to do and those I actually worked I was telling someone about that the other day like wait what I go yeah You just you just don't answer the phone and then it's like comes a shock to you But it requires you picking it up and tapping it and if you don't pick it up nor tap it It's not answered and then you just move on. I don't want nothing the world's not burning down Whatever the phone calls about like just like I was telling Jeremy like weeks ago He was I think he was like why do you always say Thursday?
00:21:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
go because that's when I do calls Mm-hmm.
00:21:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What do you mean? don't I don't don't meet with people other than one and Thursday period End of story like occasionally occasionally on Fridays, but it's totally up to me But for the most part now, that's it's not available So oh wow good you could do this.
00:22:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No one schedules more important than yours new splash Right, and I'm gonna tell you this because okay, so a couple of things first of all Summertime with parents is a different kind of vibe not not just like for me, everybody's is a little bit different like you So I don't do major Stuff and I don't do as much accountability stuff during that time because It's more important to me That there's less stress in the in the home dynamic and just whatever so but September which is what we're coming upon like everything just goes super charge and push through and if you three and all three Q4 But the other thing let's see if I can remember where I was going just now oh okay so I've been having because okay so the thing that I was doing with Maria and still doing and we're actually gonna start talking once a week because she has lost her compass and I'm like I can hardly tell well yes I did say I know this bad um she's like the wheel of chaos they're like our dad died and he was okay so but I told her I can help you with that and so we're gonna talk regularly but um but you know I'll get to benefit from just her energy her experience and her brain and I'm dying to know if she's as legit as she makes herself out to be um I think she is and I kind of do too has made people millions and not really done well for herself yeah I have a feeling but also and I mean there's a lot to it but it's all really personal stuff that isn't appropriate for me to share, but I really think a previous marriage had a lot to do with that, though, so it wasn't just her.
00:24:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
She definitely let me know some of that.
00:24:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, so and I'm I'm not telling anything I don't think has been around enough. So, you know, that's why I'll say that little bit. But yeah, anyway, so I think that I'll help her. But what we're working on is so trying to figure out what can I do to get somebody a result quickly so that they're like, oh, she knows something I haven't been seeing and can get me some results, even if I don't hire her one-on-one, right? So group coaching and core stuff. So I picked something called timesheet homework, and I don't remember if you and I ever did it. We did it something around effective hourly rate, exercise when we like it was a few years ago, trying to figure out where your time went and where it should be going and what you're earning. Don't remember if I actually- They showed you the spreadsheet and it was called timesheet homework then. Now, I'm calling it time and profit maximizer, but what it is is you write down all the things that you do, what makes the most money, what makes you money, but is really tedious, has to be done, cannot not be done, but you hate doing it. What doesn't have to be done? We're just time being wasted, blah, blah, all that stuff. What are you great at? What do you suck at? What energizes you? What doesn't energize you? And then from that, people very clearly can figure out where they need to be delegating. What they should not be doing at all and almost, well, every single time, there's an aha of, I should be doing X way more because that's really what makes me money and I'm getting bogged down in the minutia every single time. So she went through it as we were talking about it and she had that exact epiphany. She's like, holy crap. I do almost none of what I should be doing most. But then I went to a previous, it wasn't even a client, it was so what I made my freedom systems which had this assignment in it 12 years ago and he went through it and he said this was worth the whole $97 course, 12 years ago. And it was this exercising them, so I just reached out to him. don't know if you know who Tyler Ellison is, and he helped us grow sheer strength labs with Ryan Moran and Tyler's also a person that Ryan never bothered thinking. But anyway, anyway, I was like, I remember you saying this to me once that that was that exercise alone was like life-changing and worth the price of the course. I'm like, I'm curious about staying power. I'm curious if that exercise, because my premise is that if I teach you how the fundamentals work, and I teach you how it works for you by asking you some questions and just telling you some stories that make you see how it can show up for you. If that information will stay with you and change you forever, like I think it does. That's been my experience, but I wanted that was over a decade ago and I haven't talked to him or worked with him for that long. So I wanted no staying power. He said 100 percent, it is life-changing. It affects him still, like he's still using everything I taught him. He offered to give me a video testimonial and I, so that's the thing about these fundamental processes, whatever. Anyway, so for you, this is the whole reason I said this to you though because you have, I don't know, you do get some resistance to some things. You're like, yeah, I should do that. And then you just like kind of notch lot. I don't do it, but I don't push. to you very much because you still you're always pacing something really well and to me that is the the most important thing like is if we're winning mostly winning I don't care about all the other ways things that we could be doing you know what I mean but I want I'm telling you this because I want you to buy into doing time-tracking maybe just really good just once a year for a little while or maybe twice a year because there's always so much of a shift in I don't know that there's so much of a shift and I don't know that it's always maybe because we've been working together so long and you know how time just kind of like collapses and ten years ago was like a minute ago and a minute ago was like ten years ago but I feel like sometimes in your cool things with cool people and puzzles that um and I do think that you're doing a pretty good job of prioritizing because here's where I think the priorities come up really well calls on specific days making music every week cool things with cool people not a lot of the tedious stuff so to me that that is the greater value but with the goal of getting that market share of another 71 that increase um with another 71 being the biggest lever for your freedom to continue to be whatever you want to be um do whatever you want to do and have the money for that and provide for your family and and it's gonna grow right girls are probably gonna probably get married probably have some kids who knows these days but um anyway Just thinking about a little bit more strategically, I don't think it's unstrategic, but even just more refinement basically, into where time is going for the next few years, I think that the time exercise, the time tracking and the time blocking with a little bit more specific intention, a re-evaluation of goals would be something really good for us to do next month, which is next week.
00:30:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But anyway, that's what I've been thinking about. Next month, which is next week, that's fun.
00:30:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, well, I mean, I don't want to, is it fine or is it, you know, yeah, whatever or is it like that's probably a good idea, probably useful.
00:30:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, as I've expressed multiple times throughout the years, I don't make goals, I make destinations, and then I manage to get there by saying that's where I want to go, right? Because I don't, I think my problem with goals is they usually have like a time associated with them, and I don't always to the tone associated with it, but I want the destination. So some things can be reached, you know, to switch from, I'm only doing all meetings on Monday, that was a week, right, right, to switch to, I'm only doing other calls on Thursdays, that took a little longer because I was like, I kept sort of letting it slide and saying yes to a Wednesday and yes to whatever. But then eventually I was like, no, I might do that. But that was probably a couple weeks, that making music on Fridays, right, that was like, okay, I'm, I did that with Sean, right, by meeting with Sean every Friday, I established that. So I established that through using somebody else. And then I have pretty much maintained it. mean, now I make music all over the place in Fridays. So, yeah, I'm, you know, I was just thinking about it like yesterday. It was like, I let something But that I was working with those dent guys and then the owner came back and then I just told my buddy out You know what? I don't want to do this And he's like what I go. Yeah, just don't want to do this. What you mean? it really boils down to like it's not my idea Therefore, I mean it is but it's not it actually I said it's not really my idea Although it kind of is but really the problem is When it was when I was working with you as the person of the outside, it's fine But the only way this works is if it's my idea and then I have a willing participant And a willing participant has to provide feedback. They have to answer questions They have to use they have to use the things. Yeah, and if they're not gonna use the things It's just not gonna work So I was like if you come back into the fold if and if that's if that's nine months from like great We'll pick it up in nine months, but I'm not working. I'm not working anymore. I'm done Even like okay And whether he comes back or not, I don't care. Right. I don't really care. And then it's like we're getting closer and closer to, you know, fan flowies. We got a couple more things. just sent the web. I'm going back and forth with the dudes right now. I'm building the website template. great. And now I'm trying to get them to do this version for me. Let's see. I literally just sent him all your emails for me on the phone. Hopefully he understands what I'm saying. But it sounds like he does. And then it's like, okay, if we can roll that out, that's where I'm like, all right. I want to then, and then I still need bases. Eric is like, no dude, it's happening. This is really happening. It's like cool. So those guys are just banging away on code with rank. They didn't even meet this week. They're like, we're just doing code. That's fine by me. You guys all agree. You and Frank agreed. like, don't let's not be let's just stay in Jira. It's like, okay, cool. So that's going. Yeah, he hooked up Jira. I've never used it, but it's for coders. It's code or project management. Oh, okay. Yeah, it's like a whole other thing. Very interesting company worth a gazillion in these two dudes start and also started. So it's like, I'm like, all right, but I mean, I'm still it's still the same thing. Another 71 grow another 71 which PS is now up to 3.5 million ARR. So it's definitely grown this year. My stupid frickin some of my GTM stuff is not working. Some of stuff I wanted to do is maybe not gonna work. I'm going back and forth with one of Mercy's four guys who's great. They definitely know their stuff. So but I also am not working on that today. So I'm still working out some of that stuff. Mushy did do my new customer thing, and it's exactly what I wanted, so we'll make sure that that's tracking correctly. And then I was working, I'm just, I'm still trying to, I gotta get that tracking in place, and then figure out, you know, if I could figure out where the new customers come from. And then we're still dealing with this weird year. And then I think Bobby, Bobby sent out something next year. There's 25 school releases next year, which is called The Hook. Yeah, that's insane. like, okay. And those are always good for us.
00:35:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I was like, okay.
00:35:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Next year could be great. And then I started, I think I'm getting sales on some of the new products and some ads I put up. The SEO's going really good with a curd. Um, yes, I mean. I'm still just focused on like, I really just want to do like, another 71 basis and think blowing, or mom, right? And that's it, if I can get those three, yeah, any semblance of whatever. And then if Kamala gets up high, it Kamala gets elected and they put this cap game thing in place, we are not selling another 71, so yeah, we know the red event, so we'll just sit on that.
00:36:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good job.
00:36:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We will not be paying you any additional types of revenue, that is 40% F you.
00:36:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's crazy. it's not case in point, our conversation evolves so much, but to the point of just the principles, priorities, values, whatever, like, is the foundation, like that's the initial foundation, that's the first fundamental thing that we talk about, because for me, okay, for example, morning routines, and I talked to Mark about gratitude, mostly because he was Eor and just woo.
00:37:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Which is pretty much gone now. I know, I know, but let me let me get through this whole train of thought because I'm not I'm just saying talk, flash in and losing it really fast. Oh, yeah.
00:37:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, yes, it is mostly gone, but that didn't work for him, right? It was not his value. So he had to have something that was his value. The dog was his value. old day was his value spending time with her. And so he took her for walks. Well, she's gone and he's still walking and it was crazy that he's like, I walked five miles. was like, that's like nine miles, but I was like, yeah, that was that was wild. So but anyway, but you when it so that thing, right, is you're like, I don't, I don't set goals. But but you kind of do their. just not most people's goals. Yours are cool things with cool people. That's not a destination and it doesn't have a date. But it does have a spectrum, the spectrum of the quality of the cool things and the cool people. And people have fallen off the spectrum on that path. And like Francesca, like Glenn, things like that. Like this thing that you're doing with the guy, the dent thing, it is a refinement in terms of clarity about what you want and what you don't want. You do three examples. The Monday meetings, only having calls on particular days. I can't remember what the other things were anymore, because my brain. But everything that you listed, I'm like, we had a conversation. And in the middle of that, because you're like this, each of these, three things took a week. And I said, in the middle of a conversation, you're like, okay, this is what's gonna happen. You made a decision and then you pulled the trigger. And then next week, I was talking to you, you're like, yeah, I did this. And I was like, what the? But it still came from conversations about things like, where is your time going? And how do you feel about where time is going? So it's really not very different. The only difference is I have through and do that. And, you know, time blocking, like, I don't really do time blocking. I don't do it in my calendar. I do it mentally. And it's very similar to you because my value is, I don't want to live in a calendar, even though I'm aware of it. But I am looking at it constantly. But I choose the things that matter most. And then I make sure that those, like, those are my big rocks, right? Those are the things that get the most time. there's room for other things, there's room for other things. But what matters most always is getting done. So anyway, yeah, so we could just like have a little bit of a conversation, go through the exercise. What I think would happen is rather than like sending any more specific goals, it's just an evaluation of is the way that you're spending your time right now, and I'm not talking about time blocking, but case in point, the example of where's your time going, where's your energy going. I don't want to have calls on these certain days. It's really me off. I'm not going to do that anymore. So that's the kind of conversation I'm more thinking about having with you is a modified version. But there's a foundational process that I use that helps me to be able to kind of facilitate that conversation, but you're still the one that shapes it based off of how you want, how things matter to you.
00:41:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. The only thing I would say is that full of things with cool people is a principle using your terminology. That's not a principle.
00:41:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's really principle.
00:41:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. And I do have no drama principle. Oh, yeah. And then the goals are like row 1% a year. You know, work on program, yeah. Yeah.
00:41:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Goals. 1%. I already know that I'm just writing them down again, because then I'm going to create my thing.
00:41:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah. And it's like a 1% market.
00:41:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:41:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. I know what it was. Yeah.
00:41:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I'm reminding myself. Oh, yeah, which means being clear on what the market is and all that. Yeah. Principle slash values. Yeah. So drama thing is a big thing. Cool things with people. Solving puzzles is another one though. I feel like that's kind of both a value and a goal. It's that you always have a good puzzle to work on. Because I don't agree that goals, OK, goals are specific, measurable, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, But, I don't think that they have to have, I don't think they have to be finite-based.
00:42:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes, because it is the T time. don't even know what it is, right? Time-based or something. What? The T in smart is time.
00:42:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's time-based.
00:42:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right the 1% is for you
00:43:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It just doesn't have an entire specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time bound, but for me, the time bound that just sounds so risky, right? But for me, the time is not relevant if the goal is growth and expansion in that thing, which is how I set my goals. It isn't that I want to arrive at a destination. It's that I want to be further than I am now, and I consistently want to be further than I am now, because my destination is probably greater than I can even comprehend.
00:43:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, you could twist it, right? Tweak it and be like, yeah, it's time bound. And you could say with regard to not a deadline, right? So it's time bound in that you're going to look at this every quarter. You're going to look at this every month, right? So you could sort of, it doesn't, the time bound doesn't have to be a deadline. I guess, I mean, I just don't have deadlines for the most part.
00:44:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Exactly.
00:44:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Or the big ones.
00:44:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And one of the things that I tell people too, especially if we have something that's kind of obscure and a lot of the things that we want are obscure, especially when you're paying attention to this energy and when you're just like, stuff is happening and I'm just here for it, right? But you're really intentional. You're on purpose, you're doing the work. It's not nothing, but there's a little bit more intangible that's happening. so I like to tell people don't, you know, look back from a year from now. What was life like a year ago? What are you more clear on now? What is improved now? What are you more confident about now? do you have? What less stress do you have now? How's your schedule better? Like all of these different things. If you look back a quarter from now. Six months from now, sometimes it's not that big of a deal, but a year from now, a year ago, right? There's almost always some things that you can pick out and go, this is so much better than that. This is how much I've grown since a year ago, which is one of the benefits for me of getting to work with people so long as I can look at that and go night and day difference from last year on this or that or whatever. Anyway, reinforcing the not a deadline, but more like a journey thing. Yeah, okay. So you have to everything really for me for like where you're at with Mercer. This is almost being done and let's go release things that's gonna be where like, did you confirm that? How, what did you hear?
00:45:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Where did you hear it from? Hey, I CPA puts it out, right? they run them so that they they released the 2025 schedule. So he like sent a screen cap of the year or whatever.
00:46:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's like the thing, huh? That's crazy.
00:46:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. then, you know, is that a double? What is that? Oh, God.
00:46:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:46:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
triple? I think it's more than double. like double plus one, roughly.
00:46:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's crazy.
00:46:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And well, and then they've been down because of all the code.
00:46:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:46:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, yeah, it's certainly more than this year by a mile. I mean, there's only been like half that many this year. It's seven or eight maybe so far. Or not even that many so far. There's one coming up and then there's one in October or no, the next one is not until October. So there'll be like a two month month and a half and nothing. Whereas with 25, it's averaging two a month, which is Definitely not all of it. It used to be these would be even more sparse Back in the day That's when we did these huge Sailed days.
00:47:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, they probably realized that there's a similar correlation for them too And I think it's a result of having six sections now and not four Yeah Except yeah, I'm a success to Stacy because I look across as something from her and I don't think she's seen it Okay, so I'm back Adler separate Do have a recipient there I Don't know what it's talking about Okay, um, perfect wedding timeline.
00:48:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
How's that going? So, Abhishek has been sending Norio all bugs, and Norio said that he thinks he'll be ready for some beta testers. Next month. Uh, the I sent Greg, I think Eric built it. So, we have the seething chart things. As Norio, alright, what are we doing? How do I get a lead from a seething chart over? He explained that's Eric and I. Eric, I'm pretty sure he definitely is working on it because I saw some stuff today and was like, that's going to be Eric. Um, so this morning I sent the design, the layout and design ideas to Greg with the scene chart site. Norio's like, you can search and read these now. Then that's what I will do. So, Greg got that and then, we'll follow that up with Rob. I haven't really thought about the site for that, but it's going to be a better site than what we have for the current version because we're licensing, you know, it's not off. So I've never been motivated to try to generate a lead for the other side or anything like that. If they happen to happen, if they don't, they don't really care. But my plan is to generate leads to the free seating chart site, get their wedding date, all that stuff. Renau will stick it into the Wolfr Active Campaign and, you know, market is free seating chart, put them into a drip sequence, but depending on their wedding date, they'll go into the app, they get complete access to the even chart, and then they'll see that, you know, it has, you know, online feature, but it's grayed out, but they can purchase not from, I don't think they can purchase from within the app. But they can link to purchase and then it will unlock the whole app for them based on their current user name password So yeah, super interesting to see right now to talk to anybody just go generate leads Yeah Yeah then just put to you know put the other the map on that.
00:50:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, there's the pop-up all I can so Every time we've converted to selling and we being different clients Selling like up selling inside of a membership area with that like you can see the other things that you don't have access to Either it's great out over the lock screen and then you click on it goes to the sales page or a Java script You know unlock is here whatever Compulsions so that's that just increased exponentially
00:51:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We need to auto-expire them on their wedding table.
00:51:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you going to tell them now, should I give you a reminder for Stacy?
00:51:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
A reminder. So, Bobbi, wait what?
00:51:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so like the menu items is here.
00:51:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He did it. He said it to me. Yeah, he's like, here it is. I probably didn't look at it.
00:52:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you forward it? So you need to, I'd really like to I don't think I only have a general and idea of money execution channel that I am part of.
00:52:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Huh? It's not in my slack. He said, it's a world I have to go find it.
00:53:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK.
00:53:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's what it's.
00:53:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Super eyes. What's the status?
00:53:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, so they don't get it. And they're like, they really, they just want their cake and eat it too. And I'm like, yeah, that's not going to happen. So they, we had like a couple exchanges. then they wrote me back like another lying email and I glanced at it and I'm like, I ain't going to have permission. But it boiled down to like, they, they, they think the value is in the effort and work that they've done and the quality of the code. I'm like, yeah, no, that's not how it works. wish it worked like that. So then, and then they're like, oh, you know, and then you're going to become. I'm a competitor, so I'm trying to figure out. I haven't put a lot of thought into it, but some thought into it. So they wanted, I guess I'll prioritize this. They wanted 420 grand for a copy of the code. I'm like, are you high? Like, what are you talking about? I go, that's 38x. Nobody gets that. Nobody gets that kind of multiple. So then I told them, no, your business is like stub, 100,000 a year. Your value is more based on a seller's discretionary earnings formula. Here's that. Go ahead and run that. And PS, the X on that is one to two based on your gross revenue.
00:54:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:54:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, I mean, it's not even, it's worth, you know, max 20 grand max as it is. And then they're like, well, you know, then you're going to cannibalize us. I'm like, cannibalize what? You don't have anything. So they just believe in the idea, right? you don't. You really don't, as if you did, you wouldn't have a job. Right? you're want your want to outdoors. Like I'm not going to say that obviously. Right? all right. Right. What I pointed out is like, there's also the risk of overnight you could be shut down. Overnight. Right? This is against the terms of service service, um, basically. And you can be shut down overnight. Payment gateway could be shut down overnight. You guys experienced it twice. Business shut down. So I'm like, there's not, it's very risky. So I have to figure out a way where like, they can participate in the upside. So it's either like, okay, you, you give me a hand. This was my original offer. I want a non-commercial license meaning I won't sell it. So I won't sell it and therefore I'm not competing with you. You can sell it. I'm not going to sell it. I'm only and I'm only going to and I'll pay you X per month guaranteed. But it could be like I do a commercial license and then so they get X per month guaranteed and then they get a percent of account like I'd have to figure out a formula like all right I'm gonna pay you a thousand bucks a month and four thousand bucks a month that gets me 500 active users and then when I get over 500 active users you get 5% of everyone over 500 you know I mean like something like that and then and then we decide on a value like we have to get a real value so that at any time I can buy my copy. I'll pay you to customize it which is 20 grand. So pay 20 grand, I'll pay you thousand bucks a month and now get me 500 users and then I'll pay you on if it goes gangbusters you guys get to Participate on the upside and but then at any time I can buy that code base off you for a fixed amount And or we decide to fix them out and I say every time I pay you I'm buying it Right, so you're gonna get 200 grand least don't yeah Yeah, yeah, it's like a lease on sort then you'll get the 200 grand, but at any time I could accelerate that So if we're down to a value of 190 I could just give you 190 and I'm out So something like or I mean but then yeah, so something like that and I haven't obviously I've thought about it a little but I haven't thought about it a ton and I just It's like there's no that the you know effect of hourly rate There's no effect of hourly rate for me to be like I gotta get back to those guys then If you add into the mix that mark supposedly and see this, believe them, they somehow stumbled upon running ads, I'm not sure this is exactly right, but I think this. So they found out that if you log into Instagram desktop, not that after your phone, and you boost a post through the desktop, in some way that's different than definitely different than running it out on Facebook and, you know, doing it that way, but also different from boosting the post internally within the app. They don't know how or why it's different, but it's different in that they're getting followers now for 30 cents, and super as gets a follower for 19 cents. So I'm like, that's not a bad trade-off, right? And it's completely legal, like a better term. So they figured that out like like over the weekend. So I think they've been doing it for a couple of days. And now they're like, all right, now let's do the process of manually DMing them. So part of me was like, the part that Instagram doesn't like is if you auto DM someone, and we are not doing that, we never done that. That was what I was going to have to supervise that into it. So then I was like, well, what if we just created an auto DM-er, right? So if we created an auto DM-er that doesn't look like an auto DM-er, right? And we'll be really smart about it, have it just randomly send DMs, switch the DMs up, but I gave that to the JD Funnels dude, I thought Spotify out there said, hey, look into this. The only thing I think the only problem with it is I think it needs to be a desktop app, because it can't be on a server. So this builds back to, and maybe we don't need to build super eyes, maybe we just need need to build an auto dm or app that's on your desktop and it just does that so you run ads and use that and then that's totally free like it's it's included with whatever oh yeah and then I download the dm or yes I haven't thought it through that frontal right now so I like oh wait that's it right there that's what we need to do and then we've got the other devs that I found before for the super ride but when I was going to build my own thing that might be the plane I'm probably causing a couple hundred bucks super simple and then we could just test it internally hmm it's a good Dina I told you my magic is asking questions everybody does that be lifting the sides yeah well that's little thing right I don't no one sits around and asks me what I'm doing
01:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
or why you're doing it.
01:01:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yeah, but that's actually the play right there. You know what? That's not going to cost $420,000. Probably not going to cost a grand.
01:01:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I mean, there's so many different angles to it and it's like, well, I can be your competitor that you get money from or I can be your competitor that you don't. Not that you're actually the competitor, but you know what I mean? And there's other things. There's so many angles to it, but sometimes narrow minds can see the light and sometimes they can't. But regardless, you've got opportunities for days. There's so many different ways around it.
01:01:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's okay. It's okay. have a call at 1.30 and thirdly..s.
01:01:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We met with Josh at eight.
01:02:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And he, uh, he's like, yeah, we can do that. He, it's unreal how good he is. Mark and I, so I like, Mark, you need to go this tall because you get the bookkeeping side. And so we walked through it, you know, over a half hour or so. And Josh is like, yep, yep, yep, we can do that. We can build that and then Mark out of nowhere. I don't know if this is from, I think I only sent it to you. And I sent it to him too, where I was like, hey, we got to work on like the on track, I'll track dashboard. I thought that was just you, but maybe he was on there. He brought that up because I want to build the mega marketing dashboard or something and just like, that's a great day. That's a good, good job, Mark, the MMD. So Josh is going to build the thing that we wanted to talk about. And then this MMD and then he showed us some apps that he has that are super cool that I'm like, I don't know if Mark got it. I'm like, it's so funny when I look at something, I go, oh, that's interesting.
01:03:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, if it's ever possible, I would love to be on a call with Joshua. I can just see it firsthand and download all of that. Or if you have a recording, cause I only have like this tiny glimpse into what he can do. But, um, like, that sounds amazing. Instead, but he could do more than maybe I could ask other questions. That would be that we've never had an option to get a lot of this stuff. Like we've been working with Mark for over three years and it took all of this time to find Josh. And who knows what Josh was doing. Speaking of like synergy and divine stuff and things are happening that we can't control or even bring into play. We couldn't make Josh appear and Josh have his skill and his knowledge. We had no control all of that. All we could control is what do we do when we need a Josh?
01:03:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You know what I mean? And what's crazy is that he was in the middle of this random video. I was watching and I was like I had to find that guy so it was like that's how How did you find him? I was I was researching something about Lidify because I'm like I'm not doing this I'm not gonna do it. Mark could do it and then whatever and then They were like in he was like being interviewed I don't know but it was like an interview YouTube video with like four views and I watched it and I was like Who is this guy and then I figured out one of my zoomed in on the screen Or they said the firm or they said his last name. I was like that's it's such a newbie last name and I found him Through his face and then I you know them. Okay, man.
01:04:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you do this and he's okay? Insane when you think about just I know you being you, which is let me go look at that and and That you don't disregard somebody because they've got like almost no views because some of the smartest people have like no Following on Facebook and they are insanely smart and very good at teaching how to do certain things, whatever.
01:05:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
anyway, he literally was on the call going, this guy is such a score. This morning, I was like, he is such a score. So quick, the thing that he showed us was we built this app for referring out his doctor refer or I'm sorry, it's for referring to doctors, right? So think of it in that context, like, yes, you have your doctors that you're referring to, but this is also to maybe refer to a new doctor. It's integrated into Lidify. And let's say that you're like, oh, this person means a pain management doctor. It goes to Google, you put in their, it pulls their addressing from their matter record. And then on the, so that's on the left side on the right side to Google map. And it pulls up all the pain management clinics in around that area. And I'm like, wait, what?
01:05:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, isn't that how you would build your doctor network, Mark? it's also how doctors find out their competition and that's very relative to the new plan I have yeah so I was like wow that's slick and then this other thing he had is this auto mailer like physical mail and you yeah and it integrates with i don't know did you recall no i don't know if did it was his car no it was it's google google so i don't even know if you ask if it's recorded yeah yeah or he would send a video on it okay um i want to hear about all of that stuff because whatever we can use for mark also mark is in business with the client that he gave me and there's probably room for dan in there too and something in terms of marketing because that's not where they should be spending their time like he does his own seo like why are you doing your own seo like the money you make that that's dumb but also, you know, you can always just find great SEO, but I'm pretty sure he does not do great SEO. Anyway, there's just holy crap, Josh. Yes, I wanna know more about Josh. And if you have more calls, either please record it or can I come because I wanna see that brain?
01:07:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I don't normally talk to him. This he requested, and I was like, Mark's gonna be there. Mark made it sound so complicated, and I was like, I don't think I was that complicated.
01:07:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the point, yes.
01:07:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I was like, and then, but it does, it's gonna involve manual labor.
01:07:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, Mark. You're crazy. That's exactly what he ate.
01:07:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right, your employees are gonna actually have to do tasks, weekly, gasp.
01:07:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yes, that is the issue. Anyway, okay. That is awesome. I forget what you realized you figured out, but I know you figured it out, and you won't forget when it comes to what you figured out was supervised.
01:08:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, do you mind? Yeah, totally. I need to build our own.
01:08:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, because I can go back to my notes and get that if you need a reminder.
01:08:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I got it.
01:08:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, well, sir. Okay, don't forget ideas for like a gift basket. That's pretty much going to be all about Denise. We'll probably figure out something for you too.
01:08:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay, It's the other D&D call.
01:08:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got two air pods and you probably drop them in the dog bowl.
01:08:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, but they're the ones that everyone's complaining about. No, actually, that's already broke.
01:08:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm on another set.
01:08:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Mary is using the ones that you got using the one.
01:08:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's one that works.
01:08:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't think I dropped them in the dog bowl. eat the pieces of a shelf. I told that to Josh amazing. Oh, I just got air pods and like be gentle.
01:09:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, don't forget to think about the Denise basket and then, you know, have a great weekend, Labor Day weekend.
01:09:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, thanks. Oh, I think all the music I get canceled, maybe I'll probably all of them, except Mark.
01:09:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah.
01:09:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's what I meant. I don't, I don't, yeah, yeah.
01:09:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not coming that way.
01:09:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh my God. I mean, it's a base. It's a basis meeting, but it's really not inviting you, but yeah, totally. Okay. You know, I'll be late.

Hi, how are you?
00:00:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Good, good. So what's going on with you? happened this morning?
00:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have to get my hormone levels checked because I get estrogen and progesterone. And also I need keep an eye on my A1c, which is, I have diabetes. I don't have it, but I don't want to get it and just keep an eye on it. But I normally have really tiny veins that are not very good to draw. But I've been taking Clariton because my allergies have been super bad, like my whole face hurts here all the time. all the time. Anyway, and on top of that, I'm about to start my period. So I'm extra emotional and extra sensitive. And she put the tourniquet extra tight so she could find it dug in this arm didn't get it.
00:01:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's the tourniquet on this one.
00:01:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's bruised from the tourniquet.
00:01:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then she told me she would not dig in this hand, but she did.
00:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Finally got the blood three cubes, but the whole thing just hurt. don't normally cry from the pain, but like it was a lot today.
00:01:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:01:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mostly, I think probably because of hormones, but, and I was going in feeling like I was about to have a hot flash. Haven't eaten because you can't it was a fasting lab. Anyway, so this morning is emotional and I'm just ready to get on with my day. Yes, last night, I was using I hate. This is my executive dysfunction. writing anything about myself. If it's for a specific purpose of teaching somebody and tell my story because this story pertains to what you are doing and it's actually about you being my training of my experience then I'm you know I don't think about it but so what I did was I went to chat GPT with the stories I'm like I don't even know what stories it has because I've given it so much stuff and so it wrote a lot of things for me for my history and then I went in found my trainings sorry let's see for things that I had created let me shut my screen assignment that that we had I think that it needs the next iteration, but for me, I can't even explain how much I hate this type of stuff and how hard it is for me to do, especially when I'm not feeling great emotionally. Yeah. But I did because I want to make traction. So, I have base camp training videos. Nice. I teach people, I taught people, this was 12 years ago when I first created about boomerang for Gmail.
00:03:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you know what that is? Yes. Yes. attempted use it as well, but I don't use it as much, but it sounds cool.
00:03:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We don't. I mean, Gmail actually has integrated a lot of the features that Boomerang had and also taught about, yes, where I taught people how to filter their emails and use smart filters, so their inbox isn't full all the time. Let's see, reportive, and yes, where reportive is another Gmail integration that uses canned responses so that you can kind of automate, so yes, where, and reportive do a lot of the same things.
00:04:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And again, this was 12 years ago. I haven't been using them because I don't really need to because I barely work and I just have the same clients though, but that's not really scalable anyway, and not a real business.
00:04:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a job. Like I haven't dropped, let's be honest about that. Anyway, but reportive allows you to create different types of canned responses and connect with your team, so you can customize them for people and you can have those response times like Gmail lets you do a lot of things again. that it does, but it still has some other things. I had the timesheet homework, which is now the PTE Maximizer. have a video for that. I taught people how to use LastPass. I haven't gone through this, but I wonder what the webinar is. I had this program called Social Media Profits, like, because I had this partner was all about, we got to make money blah, blah, blah, this was not when he was my love, but he was just like an associate. He's very professional, like he won't associate the discord, but he always cared about me as a single mom, and he didn't want to see me be taking advantage of, and he knew things about my partner. so he would kind of try to get me to basically open my eyes, notice this thing, notice that thing and just kind of around it. and then anyway figured it out got rid of that partner and then ended up falling in love with my hero so yeah kept him nice love him anyway so um and so for i'll show you what and blah blah blah that was not good chat gpt and i got just kind of roughly which i need to assemble that's not it okay i'm going up there was a basically it took a few stories that i found and then it took some testimonials and turned it into um a story at one point it makes stories together and it put you in with my story coffee shop millionaire that was from like 13 years ago i'm like you know you're making stuff up now so um hold on a sec there's just a couple there's like one area i would show you and so my job is i'm just gonna take all of this and put it into a Google Doc and use it as kind of a framework to remind myself and modify it. Okay, so I think there was actually one more version after this that I like that one. Um, yeah, there's some things I have to modify here, but I've been an entrepreneur.
00:07:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Did you care if I read it? Like I feel like this is way my brain processes stop.
00:07:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, I've been an entrepreneur for as long as I can remember. My first taste of running a business came when I was just 10 years old, babysitting in the neighborhood, then quickly expanding my repertoire to a paper route of 11 and mowing lawns as a preteen and a team. Even back then I wasn't just doing it for pocket money. I have my sights on something bigger. This is not mine. I knew I was meant to create opportunities, not just for myself, for others, chat, dbt, liberties. Yeah. And I don't even know where this story came from. So as I got older, I naturally gravitated towards jobs that would change me to think like a leader, also totally, whatever, made that up. I found myself working in corporate America where the stakes were high level. I would say this is it. Our jobs were constantly under threat of being outsourced to places like Costa Rica or the Philippines. You had the pre-work every single day, and there was this relentless grind of reporting systems that were painfully, anyway. Okay, so bottom line is that that's where I got started. I'll rewrite this, but it was that we were in a, and I might have told you this, but in, so let's see, I worked there from 1996 to 2002. And so we had Excited Home, Apple, Intel, Adobe, Visio, all under one roof in a call center. And I, at the time was working, at the time of discovering this, I was working for Intel, and so my job was a technical team lead, but it was basically a business within a business. So I was responsible for staffing, 30 percent team, 24 hours a day, and I was responsible for hiring, coaching, terminating, so everything there, and then meeting corporate metrics. So Intel had a contract with Sykes, which was the company that I worked for, that we would answer calls within a certain amount of time, that we would resolve the calls within a certain amount of time, and at the call, the average length of the calls would be a certain amount of things. So that, those were our metrics. If we exceeded those metrics, there was a bonus, if we failed to meet those metrics, we didn't, we were penalized significantly financially, we didn't even get our contract. That would happen. And there would be this phone call from Sykes corporate office. Well, first from Intel corporate to Sykes corporate, then to my building. And then everything flowed downhill.

And so we'd have this emergency meeting.
00:10:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Somebody's going to lose their job because we're in districts. OK, well, how come we didn't know that in the first place, and how come we weren't taking care of it, and I'm tired of getting threatened? Meanwhile, most of this stuff and most of these, even the managers were industry level workers. And all the job was on the job training. So most of the people didn't care. It was just a good paycheck.
00:10:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They didn't have the work, flipping burgers, whatever.
00:10:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. But I didn't want to be threatened. I didn't want to go flip burgers. I dropped out of college. I wanted this to work. I also really loved the technology, and I loved what I was learning. So anyway, we had a Lucid technology phone. I know those big black phones that have those buttons. on them like tons and tons of buttons on them. So those buttons had all these different modes where you could put yourself. So one was like waiting for a call, one was you're on the call, one was hold, one was transfer, one was called ACW, which is after call waiting where we would write our notes, whatever. So all of those different things had metrics, but tied to that was the technology that allowed reporting. So the phones could, there was a server that tracks how long each phone, because each phone was programmed with its own number. So how long it was in each of those modes and during which time we even used it as a time clock, that was where you logged in and logged out at the end of the day. So, you know, 1996, 2004, this technology was there, but the reporting was archaic and it didn't really exist. I can't really say archaic because it was still pretty modern at the time. But what it wasn't able to do, who spit out a report that automatically told us are we in metrics or are we not that did not exist. So after about the third time being this position as a manager and going through one of these types of meetings and being like, you know, cortisol pumping through my body, maybe in short style, like what's going to happen. Like I got to figure out how to know ahead of time where I stand so that I don't go, am I the one? Is it me? So what I found out was that where there were five reports that that the loosened phone system had that if I put them into a spreadsheet and did a few formulas, I would know exactly where we stood. So it took five of them. Now, again, I so when I started working there was 21. And when I left, yeah, hold on, 2000. Yeah, something like that. No, actually, I think it started when I was 19. So anyway, again, and this is 1996, like emails brand Like technology, most people haven't been using computers, word processing was basic, knowing Excel was not something that everybody knew. few people knew it. Google Docs didn't exist at the time. So I had a friend, he was also LDS and nerdy, he was in Excel all the time. like, can you show me this? Cause I saw what he was looking at and there were formulas and numbers, I was like, is this? And so I asked him if there was a way that he could help me do this thing that I was trying to do with these different reports to make these calculations. so he helped me put some calculations in. So I had five different tabs in one workbook. And so I would dump each of the reports into five tabs. in the mornings, I would go run the report, copy and paste it into the five, just raw data tabs. And then I would have a formula on the fifth one that would do the calculations to see. So it took me 15 minutes. That's all it took. 15 minutes to find out are we a metrics and are we not and which agent of mine out of my 30 people was in metrics and which were more which meant I could then go coach them and I could look at why like because we already did call tracking but we didn't have any data to measure okay I can tell you if you did this good or bad but I can't tell you are you doing it with the end the amount of time you're supposed to be doing it because they actually implemented that corporate worldwide and it was a worldwide company and I never got stressed out about those meetings again because I was always in metrics I hired better from that because I learned to profile people looking at that a little bit better I had a brand new epiphany so everything that I do for my clients has stemmed from the experience of being under constant threat of losing my job and watching watching the cycle of Easter, right? Like, Hey, we're all good. all good. Oh, we're gonna lose our jobs. Like we, the sky is falling with really analogy, because nobody thought anything was wrong and all of a sudden we're being pulled into meetings and we're being threatened with our jobs. So, um, but it was, it was looking at metrics and figuring out that there are certain numbers that matter and have to be measured constantly and they have to be managed to constantly. And if those things are done, then everything else is kind of smooth sailing. So anyway, then went and applied it to these different things.
00:15:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is So, why did you stop selling the coffee shop millionaire?
00:15:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I quit working for them.
00:15:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, so I never sold it. Oh, sorry. thought that was your product, but you're right.
00:15:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was this other dude. I remember this now. Yeah, yeah. And he called me on a Sunday and kept calling me and texting me and I told him I don't work on the weekends and I do not talk to anybody on. Sundays. And he was like, I know you're there, like, why aren't you answering? I was like, Oh, I had no other money, no other income for kids going through a I was already going bankrupt because I was making them all this money and they're paying me $15 an hour. And he wasn't going to treat me like that on top of it. Like, bye. So he tried to hire me again a couple times after that. But yeah, anyway, yeah, they had no structure. And then was your strength, your strength labs, they were doing good. I just came in and they did much, much better. Like, regs, this is what Matt Davis said they were doing 400,000 a month. And that I, and then they sold the company for $10 million a couple years later. Do you have a testimony from them saying they went from 400,000 most to eight, I do Matt. And you know, the only way that I got it was because he wanted to hire me again. Yeah. And because Ryan wasn't going to give it to me. So this is what Matt said. Something put Tina keeps getting us results in. She came to help out our company when we were having some growing pains and needed to help cleaning up our systems. At that point, we were doing a few hundred thousand per month, fast forward, 12 months, and we've increased our revenue tenfold. Tina played a huge part in helping us to do this rapidly. She took our ideas and visions and made them a reality and we couldn't have grown this fast without her. That's 100% too. So what I did for them is I put everything in base camps. They had meetings on a regular basis and they were not due dates and they were not accountability. So Ryan did a really good job of saying what he wanted done, but he didn't want to manage anybody. And Matt had a very different personality. He just had his first baby. And he did research, whatever. They were very different personality types. then on top of that, we had a... a media buyer was just either Ellison and graphics and things like that, everything had to be coordinated and done. So there was nobody keeping track of anything. And it was just the virtue of keeping track of everything, having 18 meetings. So we were all on the same page and me saying, okay, who's doing that? When did you get done? then the week, okay, where we are because you haven't said there's any problems. So I'm expecting it's going to be done on time. And a few times of, well, no, it's behind and a few times of I didn't get it done, but I didn't say anything and me going, okay, that's unacceptable, either fix it or we find somebody else stuck out done. So, yeah, those were my biggest, I do have like the other stories would be testimonial stories that I have from people and they're they're good. But the thing is, I haven't worked for a ton of people. What I've stated. in areas and done well for a while. also, I never worked more than 20 hours a week. And a lot of people have locked me in experience, but not in efficacy. And that's really kind of the whole thing about it. So anyway, that's that's my homework. have some trainings that existed that could be repurposed and just kind of refreshed a little bit for just general tips and tools and a story behind it to say, this is what these types of simple systems, that's the thing, they're not none of them are complicated. about this is super fancy. about anything that I do is really exceptional. It's not it's not I show up consistently and I measure the things that matters and matter and I manage the things that matter every single day. And that's it. And don't allow distractions too. So this is the other thing is, each of these companies and owners would be like, well, would be cool if, and want to do other things. And I would say, okay, if you do that, are you still going to get this done on time? If you do that, is that more important than this thing? Because every time you've wanted to go off and do this, then you neglected this.
00:20:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And so I have refused to work for anybody that sabotaged the work that we've agreed to do.
00:20:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm like, I'm either staying on task or I'm leaving because you're sabotaging my ability to do my job, and I'm not going to deal with that kind of stress.
00:20:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And it's not sort of what you're doing for Dan right now? Ryan?
00:20:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Ryan? Yeah, it's what we did. But having been seven years in, he doesn't really have to be in questions. asked you, well, why do it that way? And it was cost or have you followed up with this? So because he does have a lot of different things going on. But the difference with him and everybody else is that his pace is very chill and laid back and can be because he's got a business that runs like clockwork and does really well. And even when something goes wrong, it's still really good. they have to check out the page just and they bled money and he like, it'll fix it. It'll work.
00:21:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anybody else will lose their mind.
00:21:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Dan is really like not one to compare to anything else. But I would think, um, see, he is not a testimonial kind of person. He has said something before.
00:21:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's like, there you go, Tina, that's the best you're ever going to get. it was amazing. I didn't. Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah. Remember when I had to call him, he showed
00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, that fun. I think it was a CPA thing or a counting thing or something like that.
00:22:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, it's like this. Yeah. Okay. So it's Chris. Yeah.
00:22:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And Dan Meredith, it was, was wanting to get into copy. He was copywriting, but he was kind of new at it and he had his gym. But he did everything on notebooks and he just, I think he didn't define his values in the beginning. And so that was one of the conversations. And then it was stick to them, you know, and his values were shifting. And that's something that people have to take into account because values do shift generally until you kind of lock into your real core values and then they really never shift, not the main ones. But there's a point in most people's lives where they're shifting, shifting, shifting until they lock. I think kids are locked in now, but then they were definitely in flux and it was just the conversation about what you want, be clear about what you want, be honest about what you want, be aware of the way that you're sabotaging your opportunities to get what you want and stay focused, stop trying to please everybody, stop trying to, you know, don't say that you want to be a business owner and then also want to go play and do all these things, like which one matters most? If you want to play most, be honest about that and go do that. But don't act like you're a business owner that you care about the business. And so those are the conversations to have with a lot of people and like I've got one client and he's an eight figure client and he wants a lot of growth and but what he wants most is freedom. And so, the kind of growth that he wants requires more management than he wants to put in, and I said, that's okay, but you just have to be aware that there's this disconnect and pick the thing that you want most and the thing he wants most is to not have to show up in the office when he doesn't want to show up in So, then you have to be okay with, you know, 80, 20, right, this 20% of the time that you're not there, that a lot of stuff is just not going to be optimized and working the way that it should, but it's so profitable, and it gives you everything else that you want, except for the massive success that you want, you know, you have to be with the trade-off that you're not getting to the level of accomplishment that you want to, because the other accomplishment is you have a ton of freedom. Freedom and happiness that other people will never have.
00:24:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, yeah, true. Um, I wanted to also though, uh, I kind of, I didn't do my story all that yet, but I did do, I listed off a whole bunch of products and I had a Google She already for some other products with my own possible brand name, but I wanted to segue straight to Joanne because like, oh, yeah. Sorry. It's okay. It's okay.
00:25:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
because I have a three o'clock.
00:25:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I got half an it's all, it's all good. And so like, do we want to just see what she's given me already?
00:25:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Yeah, because I haven't even gone through all the stuff that she sent over.
00:25:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's been crazy. Either by either by.
00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll let you share.
00:25:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Just to have a gander here, some stuff I just started filling out. I have like so many things, like micro offer magic is my main course, but I have like from likes to members. 7-figure offer launcher, I-impossible sales system, traffic and sprint workshop, I-impossible sales system. I'm all over the map, ADHD, can see, I have e-commerce email promotions, swipe send profit, I-impossible success system, that was like teaching people how to make their first 1K and was like a Facebook group. I have scale of challenges and also the ultimate challenge masterclass is challenges kind of on the OG for way back in the day before everybody else is doing them. Ultimate webinar, and that's how I made my first million through those $17 challenges. Ultimate webinar sales, visibility workshop, ultimate Facebook group, cash injection, I wouldn't look at this now because I don't believe in Facebook groups as much right now, even though people are still using them, love and ways to grow good fast and then old stuff, like we're talking like from more than 10 years ago, get published mastery. Well, this one's not 10 years, this was three years ago, this was a 3K, six month cohort, I mean like 25K. one month selling it, a social sales system, just teaching people how to make money on social sales using Facebook groups or Facebook or social media and bring them to a book or call funnel or selling, know, cohort. Fast-cast mastery, these are old ones now. If I were to say the first ones, this was the first one. The first one that really took off, I had the ultimate consulting challenge. I think I first sold for a buck and five bucks. Thousands went through it. Like I had 6,000 buyers of this low ticket that I increased at four and I said, this was a great kind of catalog model to everything else because as I got all these buyers, then I would have an ultimate Facebook challenge because to be a good consultant, they needed no social media. I would have mobile challenge to be a consultant.
00:27:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They needed to learn how to also deal with mobile optimized websites because remember, this is like 12 years ago.
00:27:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Then I had social media challenge because being a consultant, they needed to learn how to use social media. same thing to make it's all you hadn't learned video. So that call me calm automated in me offering a social media certification program down here. And that was a 2k program that certified people in social media. And that was back in 2010 or 11. So I sold 200,000 one week social is at that time no one had a social media certification. Everybody knows brother has that now vacation.
00:28:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I guess before Kate Buck had social media manager pro.
00:28:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is before Kate Buck existed. This is back.
00:28:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that was great.
00:28:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Wow. Yeah, was. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Social media certification program like innovator. Yeah, like the thing is, you know, what means I'm usually always innovating on what's trending right now and using what, you know, kind of like a superstructure what people all know and stuff. And I had momentum like once I had this all going, I had such momentum.
00:28:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, that had been costing though.
00:28:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It was because every month I was launching something new. It totally was right, but I had team like I use these and that's different. Yeah I was using base camp.
00:29:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I had a really good team like you know, and I had a lot of JB partners So it was I was I was true leader like in the CEO of the of the business We were making at least a hundred thousand a month and I was you gonna have a great podcast episode about this and break this down And some trainings about what because there are different seasons, you know And we use stuff like that and like I was the first thing I was gonna say My head is like that was not a leverage business except for you were leveraging trends For business opportunities and revenue opportunities because another thing I was thinking Earlier today. I was like I would never do X. I would never do X. Like all I was listening to a podcast They were talking about the restaurant business and how hard it is and it's such like Fin margins. I'm like I would never do that and I'm like but what if that was the only thing I could do to make money What if that was thing I knew, what if I had no other skills, like, yeah, what mind to say, I would stick up my nose and say, I would never do that. And also where he if nobody did that. And so I kind of caught myself in my ignorance and against, like, I, because first of all, I don't believe in infinitives for the most part, never always this type of thing. Because for the most part, I think there are very few things that are eternally and infinitely ever true. But that the seasons are really important. And I think as coaches or consultants or whatever or leaders or teachers, is that we help people understand that there is a season where something does not make sense for you, don't do it. But only you can know that and other times where it does. But like, because if you go listen to somebody who's telling you to do something that's not compatible with your season, your environment, your skills, do our values, et cetera, then you are creating, that is a recipe for disaster on a spiritual level, on an emotional relationship level, like anything that you do something is just so counter to those particular things, an environment, skill set, relationships, values, whatever. It's destructive inside and you'll just implode in. But this is amazing, all of your things. You put time, could you put a timeline to the left, roughly like 2010, like drag it down for whatever ones you did in that area?
00:31:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sure, I'll do that later just because I want to talk about it. Sorry.
00:31:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's so much.
00:31:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm just like, whoa. Yeah, no, no, I've been thinking about that too because they'll even show people how many products I've created and stuff. video ads made easy. was more in 2016. That was before people were teaching about video ads. Because one of my nephew, I brought his e-comm company to 1k day in sales using video ads, and we sold it 18 months later from startup for over a million dollars to venture capital company, that to e-comm company. Facebook ads scale, that was probably 2020, Black Friday, Cyber Monday Toolkit, that's probably 2020.
00:32:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, is that what made you post the...
00:32:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, because I just have to change dates, like the email's already done and everything, so yeah. That's awesome. Email-deliverability class, I actually did that a few months ago because I wanted to start doing some master classes to then put into little ticket funnels.
00:32:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You looked as crazy as I started teaching about that in 2000, it was with coffee shop just talking about it, and it's actually how I had my first conversation with my sweetheart because he had an email list. So they were getting 10,000 names on it a day.
00:33:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
he's like, whoa, yes, 10,000 names, 10,000, 10,000 often today.
00:33:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's big time. Yeah, but yeah, but they, but they didn't, but it was a new thing to be thinking about sender scores and reputation and inbox placement, that kind of thing. But but I was learning about it because it was impacting us at that time. So yeah, yeah, yep.
00:33:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anyway, wow, that's pretty well. Anyways, okay. So I'm just going to sit you this alive.
00:33:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean, well, this is shows what it's probably so you are.
00:33:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I'm so glad you did this. And Frank Kern promoted this, by the way.
00:33:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was funny. I found him on my list when I was looking through my email list. Oh, yeah. Yeah, Frank at Frank Kern dot com.
00:33:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
think it was funny. Yeah. So okay, so let's go to this girl by the way. Hey, I did post another comeback just for the hell of it. Hey, I'll do a done for you funnel. I don't know if they've released it yet. Uh, but I said they have to have $20,000 working capital. So just FYI just posted that today. Um, just to say my self time because people have been reached out to me, but they like want me for implementation and they want something for cheap.
00:34:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyways, it looks like I've improved yet, but all right up in here.
00:34:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:34:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what was, uh, that's the thing though. So this time next week, Maria, if we, if we spend this, we really, um, putting these things, these two things together. And even if we just like record ourselves having conversation about the things that we've done and built and who we served, then go frame the offer after somebody can be like, who are you?
00:34:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've never heard of you. And then they go watch. This is what you did.
00:34:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:34:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know what I mean? Yeah, there's only once like glitch because it's Canadian Thanksgiving this weekend.
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I am. Taking Friday money. Oh, okay.
00:35:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's only glitch. It's FYI. I think it's Joanne, right? I was gonna dump her stuff into one of the Google Doc because she sends me so many things. Well, look at the free group. You should probably look at my new funnel. We are in the process of making. I don't want to get dropped into too much.
00:35:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's red clogs all over the place. Those are the types of people. They want you to work without money and you realize me looking at your stuff is you taking my time.
00:35:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, we could turn the table and look at something, make some if you want to continue with us and I can just give it the CMO.
00:35:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
COO's thing is that it hates 6,000.
00:35:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you want to do this, like, or out? Or something else that's, yeah, because it's just, um, yeah, I mean, I can do two YouTube videos in the time that we took to talk to her that three hours that one night, then I would have, you know, tons of views on YouTube and build in my YouTube channel, you know, yeah, so I think it's important to see you see what if you can improve what we have, we have six, so that's the other end flag, we have six ages, she's trying fail, so I want to be fully transparent. So she repeats that a lot too, by the way.
00:36:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, um, what's the common denominator?
00:36:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Of why the agency tried to fail, I don't know.
00:36:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She is the common denominator. Her business is the common denominator.
00:36:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, because I can't believe that she would hire a new agency now and expect them to beat the past agencies when it's like the election month's coming up and it's most time to run ads. Yeah, you know, so she's probably going to complain about these guys, you know, unless she's because I said it, maybe that's in her ear now, both.
00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
These guys. Well, the other thing is when you go into somebody like that, like the odds that you're going to succeed are slim and then your reputation is messed up because they go around, this person couldn't do it either.
00:37:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
not going to put myself in that situation. Yeah, so she keeps talking about this funnel. I was thinking while we look at the free group, we should probably look at my new funnel, so I'm just going to highlight this new funnel. So I don't know where what her new funnel is. I think it's important for you to see if can improve what we have. So really she wants us to come in and optimize her business.
00:37:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's the thing. I never talk about this because it hasn't come up too much, but people have to have, so there's a minimum amount income to have at least... 50% profit margins so that they've got some working capital. She does not have 50% profit margins and she's got maybe like 10%, I don't hold on let me see, she said 2.6, so I to do this, 1, 2, well let me do this. What percentage of $2.6 million is $600,000? I'm just going to show my likes on 23%, yeah 23% margins, okay 6, 1, 2, 1, 2, divide by 2, I have 60% so I have no idea if you can see my animals but I'm going to turn my share screen off.
00:38:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay and because it's just really funny because the cat and dog are almost beside each other and that's
00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
not that often you see the baby's where's the baby's oh barely see i know hold on let me let me try and reorganize this oh my gosh the cats in the cat bed and the dog is right there leading up against the couch oh is that funny i just don't see that that often love it really just looking away he's all tired up because he was at the doggy daycare i picked him up just about an hour ago yeah she's funny she's got that they're adorable she's got 23 profit margins and i mean there are businesses that have that but before it being virtual and i mean it's just poorly run yeah it needs a massive overhaul um it sounds like a lot of stress i'm not interested in a lot of stress yeah that's the biggest thing i as much Such as somebody's mission excites me is I'm not going to go into somebody else's home and and stay there if it's chaotic.
00:40:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, and what I love what you just said, that's where we're down, honestly, like my energy just increased. I don't even notice it because it's like how refreshing will be able to say on a podcast or videos. Hey, if you if you have a business that's doing over $50,000 a month with 50% profit margins, we can help you. Boom, like it's that crystal clear, you know, and because I've been frustrated with the calls I've been getting over the last two weeks because. And I created the situation because I did three months ago, the 2k offer and then the 997 a month. So let me turn the box around silent. And yeah, I'm just like, the hell, I'm not going to work for you for for free or like especially with that one lady was like, why don't need a coach. I actually just need someone to implement stuff and she needs to figure out how to move her stuff to go high level. I'm like, I'm not your gal. So it's just like, I don't even know why I thought the pocket CMO COO doc was pretty clear, but then when they get on the phone with me, they want me to implement. That makes sense?
00:41:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it might be that they're mixing old offers with new ones and just thinking about something that they were already sold on in their mind before. And then you became top of mind again, but we feel the old offer. Now, they don't have to have those kind of mop, or the bigger the company gets, the less likely those margins will exist. So, you know, nothing lower than 30 if you're at 100 k a month. I don't want to, I'm not going to be there if it's less than basically it's about how much, how much money is being made and set aside. So 50% profit margins of 50k, there's, there's 25,000 left to be investing in people and teams and systems and ads. there's a reason that I said that specifically. Now, yeah, so it's, it's about knowing that you have enough to pay my fees. Yeah, plus ads and other people. So it isn't just a random number.
00:42:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So, okay, so let's see what else you sent us. Um, did she put this in frickin Googled?
00:42:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, she says she used a computer, right? Oh, that's a no.
00:42:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would not work with somebody who doesn't use She typed this app.
00:42:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She sent chat GBT. Before she dropped that in, she says, I'm gonna go to chat GBT and get you something. So I think she did that there. Which was interesting. don't use Google Docs or have a computer, you chat GBT. Like that's, I don't know. Oh, I don't know how old she is, but she didn't do
00:43:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Brianna, she's in her fifties for sure. If they used to do the road tour of all the female singers back in the day. So, oops, showed. I know it's a little ugly, but, um, and then she gave us access. Let me know. I'll write to Marima partner to be on the call and give you access to everything and talk you through how we run TTM. Well, thought that's what the call last week was about, but took three hours. Here's the free community. Oh, I thought she gave me access to the community.
00:43:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So another requirement I have, Maria, that the so because everything that I was about leverage and optimization. Yeah. I. I don't work with anybody that is, um, not focused. I don't know if she wanted and she's not focused. She's focused on her goal and her mission, but not when it comes to structure and organization, like her mom doesn't, didn't even want to charge money. And she's like, I just like, she, she's focused on a huge number of revenue, but not margins. She didn't even know what her margins are. So what I won't do is teach somebody who's making that much money, business values, and act like I'll train beginners that stuff, not one on one, but through courses, right? But I'm not going to teach somebody who's already responsible for other people's lives and making millions of dollars, the fundamentals anymore, because there are that will work with me that I don't have to do that with. Like, there are people who are making millions of dollars and want the kind of help you and I have because they want to go further, but they're not a giant mess. They just don't have the person who will also, like they're leveraged and optimized in their brain, but they don't have anybody else who will do that in the business for them. So they have to be that person.
00:45:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
00:45:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When she does, she wants that, but the positioning would have to be incredibly clear. This is what you get from us. It's going to cost X. We're going to do this a little bit and your team is going to have to do the rest of it. We're basically going to tell you what should happen, give you the targets, help make sure everybody's clear on why we're doing it, how we're doing it, and then other people will do it. We will not actually do the work. will, you get our brains. you get our experience, you get our leadership, but we are not the operators.
00:46:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I am not anybody's operator. Yeah, I think that's the shift that I'm going through now, too. And that's why I find it interesting because some people like still want me to be their operator, you know. So yeah, um, available. Yeah. So, so it's still one core problem or problem.
00:46:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Brian Moran offered me 30% of a new company if I would come down to Austin and run it for him. But I don't, I'm like, I'm not interested in that kind of like this work.
00:46:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
wouldn't want it.
00:46:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, tell me Tina, everybody has a prize.
00:46:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, you're set to douche back. You don't use a douche bag, yeah?
00:46:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. So, plays nice and tries to wants to be liked, but anyway.
00:46:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, um, what, what is she at the end of the day? So I'm in the, I'm in the Facebook group. This is breastfeeding, so we're in this group right, breastfeeding out. Like, there's two groups. is your question, please? One thing we would need to know is what's her org chart?
00:47:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I know she doesn't have one, but she'd need to create one. Who's on your team? What do they do? How much do you pay them? How many hours a week do they work? How good are they at what they do scale of one to ten?
00:47:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you want me to ask her to do that?
00:47:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, if you have any interest in working with her, you need to know those things. Because that's an asset you need to know. So, like, if you're not going to be the operator, somebody else is. Who would you be working with?
00:47:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, can you send us an org chart of your business and what their roles are?
00:47:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who works for you? First names, last initial. What are their roles? are their and Where are they located? How many hours a week do they work?
00:48:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And In words for you, including these include subtrumptor everyone.
00:48:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. We need the names so that we can differentiate between people when we're looking at it. And know that, you know, like, if one person occupies two spots, we need to be able to tell.
00:48:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What are the roles and responsibilities?
00:48:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where are they located? many hours a week they work? Yes.
00:49:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do they work?
00:49:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How long have they worked for you? Scale of one to 10. How good are they at their job?
00:49:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anything else?
00:49:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What has your team consisted of in the last two years? What people were here in the last two years that are not here now. Why are they not here now?
00:49:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So what has your team consisted of in the last two years?
00:49:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh-huh. That is different than what you have right now.
00:49:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Who's missing?
00:49:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're left, Who's missing and why are they missing? Because this is going to eliminate leadership issues.
00:49:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You mentioned one part in the moment. Okay, so I thought I had this opener messenger and it went back out, I like looking at one's bigger.
00:50:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The other thing I know we talked about it last week and I just want to reiterate it is that she's not doing us a favor, bringing us to the table of big deals. Yeah. You would be doing her a service, giving her the ability to actually handle the big deals that are coming her way and not tank them. There's no lack of opportunity to get money. is a lack now, but there are limitations to what we say yes to. If you wanted to go sell your soul, you could go find lots of people who would throw tons of money at you. you wanted to go burn yourself out, you could find lots of people who would throw big money at you, Maria. You know that. You don't want to do that anymore. No. That's been part of. probably a big part of the issue with their dad being gone is that there's something that happens when we lose people as we start to realize how fragile mortality is and how short it is. And so we want to spend more time with the people that we care about and we are more with their you were conscious of it or not. We're more conscious of the fact that you don't want to spend your time in places that steal from you the life that you do have. And so I don't think you were super like surface level conscious of that but I think your heart was like I can't. I don't want to do that stuff anymore. And even with what's her name? Boutique. Karina. Yeah Karina. Even with that like I think that that was probably more about I mean business business and you like business but also it was about relationships.
00:51:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
know you care about people
00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that you work with partners and friendships. so that was the thing that your spirit is like, I need to like the people that I'm working with. And that was there. But then you weren't being honored properly. I know she had real issues, whatever. She wasn't holding up front of the bargain. So now it's just kind of realizing that there are trade-offs that are acceptable and trade-offs that are not acceptable. This is what's becoming clearer and clearer to you on a daily basis. And so these opportunities, but people even like Joanne, that's not super clear too, because she hasn't figured out what she sabotaging with her chaos or her, I want to make 10 million dollars. And even though she said I want to double the rate of breastfeeding, the thing that she repeated multiple times was 10 million dollars, 10 million dollars, 10 million dollars. You only said, I want to double the breastfeeding rate once. And that's when I asked what the goal of mission was. So the thing is she's actually focused more on the financial goal, according to her own language and energy, then she is on the mission of doubling the breastfeeding rate.
00:53:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I do find it confusing how to help her at this point, like, you know, I'm really thinking that it's probably not a good idea.
00:53:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
think probably the best thing that we could do is, and if we were willing to be benevolent enough to do it, go through this together and say, okay, here's some of the things I would ask.
00:53:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let her answer the questions.
00:53:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If she answers the questions that we gave her structurally, go in and say, look, the best thing that we're willing to do for you right now is give you an audit and we will make a recommendation, which is basically the COO CMO kind of pocket, but modified for her, which is an audit and these are directions we think you want to go. Now, if you want us to implement it. Here's what it's going to look like. It's going to cost you and we're still not going to manage it. We'll help you find an ops manager if you don't have one or project manager. Otherwise we will lead guide and train your manager. It will cost a lot, you know, because we're going to get our $500 minimum hourly and and something like that. But I think that that's all that we do is we give her structure and guidance and potentially train one of her leaders. And and that's just and it's truly honestly it's benevolence whether and if she doesn't see it that way and doesn't want it that way, that's okay.
00:54:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Bye.
00:54:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look, everything will be fine. You'll find your people and we're glad to have talked to you. It's a great mission to have. But we have our own missions and they don't particularly align.
00:54:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So it looks like they have the Thompson products. Like it's very weird like I don't even know what. funnel is right it's it's it's just one thing Thompson method for looks like one hundred percent off so it's probably two four seven always on sale she said all like once a month or something once every other month to bring in the cash which then makes it she could probably get to her 10 million by cutting that price in half well this uh this is what she says it for now whatever the price is if you made it because most women especially brand new moms who are learning how to breastfeed in the first place that's where they have a poorest when you're young and having your first child oh so you think this is too expensive hundred twelve twenty Canadian it's not that I don't think it's that valuable I think that that if they cut they could offer it to more people so there's different ways of scaling right um one of them is getting more cut
00:56:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Customers the other one is getting less customers more priced now. I don't know what the the support level is And I don't know if that's feasible But I do know that this particular thing is something that is more important at one season in life And that's your first baby And now I needed all the way with every one of my children because I never got it figured out So that's that's not the limitation, but it's most needed with your first baby And the first baby is usually when you're youngest and poorest So taking that into account in the market What happens if you reduce the cost? Yeah And you could even call it like a first baby special whatever doesn't matter if it is or not if somebody wants it and it causes them to convert We don't care for it's your seven baby.
00:56:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know Would a mother notice The order bump is discover how to safely collect in store of Colostrum and dr. Rob is masterclass for just $24 and learn whether it's the right to
00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
choice for you and your baby's well being what is colostrum like so when you first when you're before your milk comes in um you and even while you're pregnant you ooze out colostrum which is loaded with antibiotics cows have it in fact i don't know if you've ever heard the supplement called armora um they sell it because now they get it from cows and people take it as a supplement so it's but but mother's colostrum is loaded with the most powerful vitamins and antibiotics for the baby to improve their health but once your milk comes in there's no colostrum it's just milk so but you get colostrum all throughout your pregnancy every month's different but i've never heard about storing that that's not a normal common thing you might be able to youtube it but i'm 48 half four kids and two grandkids and i've never heard about or thought about storing colostrum
00:58:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, what I'm also thinking is, is that, um, that order bump is probably terrible, uh, converting right now, because in the way that it's listed, yes, well, yeah, I don't even know if that should be the order bump, maybe some other different order bump, like for $7 something, like even maybe a meditation to calm yourself while you're pregnant, I don't know, but just I don't think a confused mind says no, and I don't think every pregnancy will know what the hell that is.
00:58:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, um, I think they will, yeah, if you've studied anything about breastfeeding and got to the point that you know that that's the first kind of milk that comes in, and it comes in before milk, also a lot of women will leak it, and that's one of the signs that they're even pregnant, um, before they have babies, and so they're like, what is that, and then they go ask the question and they learn what cholesterol moves. I knew I was pregnant two days after I got pregnant, way before you could go, because of that. were just so sore and they were leaking. I was like, what is this? Milk's not supposed to come in now, and my mom's like, that's colostrum. And then I knew the difference when my milk came in, because I was rock hard, it was extremely painful. didn't know could get rock hard, but they just like overnight milk came in, and it just was so painful. Like, have you ever had any part of your body be so swollen that you could, like it was shiny and you could just feel the pain of the swelling, just the swelling, not an injury per se, but just swelling? Yeah, my knee, but it wasn't shiny, but yeah, my knee. Yeah, so that but breasts. Terrible. Have you ever tested different price points and what are the conversion rates over those different price points? Are you late for a call?
01:00:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
She's okay. Well, this will be interesting because if she doesn't give us all this information that shuts the door on spending even more time on her, right?
01:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yes, exactly. And I think that what's probably going to happen is she's going to Um, this is, this is, this is my thing is I get, and I ask a question, whatever. people like, yeah, no, never mind. I'm like, okay, that's fine.
01:01:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know, yeah, I think, I think if I could go back in time, I probably would have told her, let just just pay a six thousand off our thing, pay two thousand for, for like the first, um, you know, analysis, like all it, you know, that we'll do for you. Let's go from there. And then, cause right now, um, I'm not motivated to work much for her.
01:01:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, and she's already had someone to my time. I wouldn't do it for that. I'd do it for at least four thousand. So split two, two for you, two for me. It's taken too much, like this type of thing, a new business. You have to wrap your head around a lot of stuff. And you have to wrap your head and it's the energetic exchange with a person. That is very draining. That's not just showing up and doing work.
01:01:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
New people are new exhaustion. And so she, she, sorry, go ahead.
01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. there's a price to pay for that is all like I'm only willing to make a certain exchange for that.
01:02:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah and she she has the warning signs because it's sort of like this guy I'm talking to at 5.30 today knows me from Ellen's tennis group message me and said the guy that built my funnel everything he's changing his business model so he's no longer running ads and working optimizing funnels so I'm left with out that talent is that something you can do can we talk and so boom we're talking and then right away he sends me the here's the funnel pages and I stopped running ads but if you want the conversion rates let me know so it's very like there's no energy drain like it's it's like okay let's get to it this is what I yeah yeah but without payment so just keep that in mind because it's also simple like did he pay you?
01:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know because he wants to talk about whether I do that kind of thing to help him okay okay like like just don't I wouldn't go giving away free advice whatever just I have seen people take that way very easily by starting to send you stuff and wanting you to look at it. That's taking your time. Like, I'm willing to do it on the call with you this amount of time. I'm not going to go dig into it. Your job now, if I'm talking to you is you're going to walk me through this on the call. not giving you any extra time other than the call. If we come to an arrangement on the call, then you pay me, then I'll look at it. But this calendar time I'm giving you is all I'm giving you until I know what you're going to pay.
01:03:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know what I mean?
01:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, there's just so many tire kickers, like, and you have to be careful. types of people, the funnel, you know, managers, or ones, whatever, but anyway, I just protective of you.
01:03:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Thank you. No, but you're right. Because yeah, when I was doing those free onboarding calls in Scoop Group, yeah, majority of them was bad. And I'm like, okay, why am I doing this? This is stupid. And that's why I made it five bucks a month instead of free, and you're in a min on it. And I changed it to business accelerator. or so.
01:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah. My, so I know you got to go. I'm just going to do this. I have a linear path. And to me, it is get our histories, like our pedigrees basically written and figure out what we could do with our existing products. What are the ones? How quickly could we get them repurposed into a tiny little package, a small little type of offer. But then with the pedigree, and here's what we've created, are you interested in talking to us about whatever, but it's, you know, the high level price. And instead of worrying about conversions, I just trust that the right people will come into that. And in the meantime, you can do the, you know, our consulting or whatever, but then you're not committing yourself to fulfillment. When you get off the call, you're done. You don't have to think about them anymore. But at some point, one of those phone calls will probably lead to Maria, I need you. You can be like, here's the price. And I won't do the implementation. But what I can do is, lead your implementer. And I can direct your implementer potentially and say, okay, here's what you should do. And this is what it will cost you and you keep that $500 EHR in the back of your mind always. So whatever price you offer is like, okay, well, talk to you for an hour, four times a month and it's $2,000 or $2,500 or $3,000 because you know they're going to talk to you throughout the week a little bit too. And so but I'm not doing it, I will give you the strategy. I will tell your person what they need to do. I'll help you set a base cab so that we can check every week that everything's on track and you get one hour my time. That's it, $3,000, $4,000, whatever.
01:05:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, cool.
01:05:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then you get your money and then you're not burdened and then we can build the scalable stuff as it goes. Love it. Okay, I'll let you go.

Hey, hey, long time no see I know it feels like I don't like it.
00:00:08 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's been a month or so. Yeah, I didn't know if we were meeting today or that was like a legit invite. I guess you get it set up now for monthly calls.
00:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, well, yeah, I mean, we could do we could do every other week. Um, like I don't and just figure out what works for you. You've been very busy and very quiet with your head down working. So yeah, I don't know what to do. I don't know what you need, what you want right now.
00:00:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I mean, it's just, uh, you're in a good flow. It seems like. Yeah, I mean, I'm just my day. I mean, it's summer. So yeah, so it's really about like maximizing the mornings and, um, I mean, I, I work. in the afternoon too, but like, it's just mornings just my jam. So like, it's actually, it's funny. was actually getting ready to write an update.
00:01:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, good. I did, I thought the morning six, twenty six, twenty four. I was like, oh, I'm like, okay. And I left some comments too, but mostly just about what I want to talk about from the notes that you left last week. But so go ahead.
00:01:30 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, I mean, just, I guess just quickly, like, things are going well with Tim, Tim's the Jim Profit, Jim Solutions guy. I'm working on a new sales letter, well, promotion for probably middle of July, so I'm looking out for them.
00:01:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And and your results paid for many months of working with you.
00:01:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So that's pretty. Yeah, in our officially our. 90 days will end on July 17th, so probably after the 4th, I'll send him an email and just acknowledge like, hey, we're coming up at the end of our 90 days. Do you want to continue working together and review the results of the promo and then this new promo that I'm writing for them?
00:02:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would recommend saying, hey, you know, that that last promo basically paid for me for the next nine months, so what do you say? Keep working together and here's what we do and that there's no way, you know, that you're not going to keep making more money for what I'm doing, so I'm thinking it's a no brainer and and I'm telling you because I just did that with one of my attorneys. So last year, I talked to, so I have an attorney that has another office and he's got like, sits attorney.
00:03:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
journeys that work for him.
00:03:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Last year, I talked to two of them. One of them was his top performer and one of them was his bottom performer. And the top performer was like, I don't need you, I'm good. Which was okay, because she's the top performer. the other one was like, yeah, I've got all these goals, I could do this, I could do that. And I gave them a couple of books. I, you know, after listening to him, I'm why don't you just work on this one thing? And he did, and he doubled his attorney fees. So he went from a million dollars to two million dollars attorney fees. And so this last week, I was talking to him, because he was talking about wanting to do some work. I'm like, well, I mean, the results paid for itself last year. You could be in pay me every month and you'd still be in profit from hiring. So that's a brainer.
00:03:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You guys. Oh, yeah, you're right.
00:03:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, well, just don't think about what the return is. And so just pointing it out in simple math, like right in front, like, you know, when we do the numbers exercise, the numbers just make it a no-brainer. like, oh, duh, I mean, already ROI form the initial investment plus eight more months, you know. So it's just, if you want the job, that's the no-brainer offer.
00:04:27 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right, right. Yeah, that's a good point. I'll, yeah, I'm thinking after the fourth is when I'll put any mail together, but that's, you know, and I'll definitely point out, like, you know, we brought it, we did 45k to own our first promotion. And what are the profit sharing, like, profit partner kind of arrangement? Yeah, I mean, I think that that can be in the future. I mean, honestly, like, right now, I mean, I kind of, I kind of like getting the 5K every month and, and that, that feels like it's serving more what I need right at the moment.
00:05:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, just guaranteed it's there.
00:05:17 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, yeah, but it's also giving me just like, I mean, the competences, I'll just say it. I feel like there's a better word, it's giving me Or it's holding my eyes to like, you know, I can, like, I can go and if this falls through with Tim, like, I'll, I'll go to somebody else and I can handle, you know, writing their copy of their emails. I think one of the things I've learned working with Tim is like, because. He's got a very specific strategy that he's wanted to do, that he is doing in a space with group, and we're following this client and community guys for Stapleton, and he's got a partner for his name, but you know, it's like I'm writing, I guess this is the first time that I'm really executing on what the actual work to be like a lightweight influencer of sorts, and I say lightweight because it's only like one post a day where I think of like a TikTok influencer or putting out a bunch of short form content, so it's a different type, but it's a different type of content, and it's, I was thinking about this, like I think It really is the first time that I've done this kind of thinking and work of like creating social media content, tying it to a promotion that I know is coming to three weeks from now and thinking about like seeding these little agreements in my posts. And that and that's that part is cool. But I where I'm going with that is like I kind of that like that's fun to think about for somebody else and do it for them. It is not the thing that I would want to do for me as a guest. So yeah, there are two things I want to talk to you about right there.
00:07:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So first of all, you're doing one of my favorite strategies, one of my favorite levers, which is getting paid to learn and to sharpen yourself off. So this is a really, really viable skill, even if you don't want to do it. or so doing it for other people, it's important to know the logistics of how it works and why it works. I'm the same way I don't want to do any of the stuff for myself. What I can do for everybody else, I almost always cannot do for myself. I can do a little bit of it. But I think about doing it for myself and like new, not going to happen. Just I can, I won't. Part of that by the way is in alignment with 80 and negative dysfunction. And that can be a really normal thing for most entrepreneurs.
00:08:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It tends to be for like all of my clients.
00:08:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can always treat everybody else differently. So there's that. But if you have enough clients of your own, we're not doing a lot of work, we can hire somebody that can do this for you. That will extract from you what they need to do. That's very good at doing this. But because you already have the skill and knowledge, when they're driving, you can go actually, why don't we tweet this and that? So it goes to the same kind of thing that you like to do when it comes to copy, which is copy cheating, not the junior copywriting, right, you don't want to start from scratch. So if you have enough funds where you can hire somebody for maybe $1,000 a month. And obviously, you'd need to be where you're really comfortable and you've got that. So the goal would be maybe another Tim or two, if it doesn't take a lot. Because that's an extra $10,000, which you could even use for a junior copywriter, you know, a little bit of it. So, so that you're not adding too much work. But that could be really leveraged. And so now you can hire somebody to work in your own business, who's very skilled, but you don't need a lot of time to build out a social media campaign. So it's not like they got to work 40, 20 hours, you know, maybe 10 hours.
00:09:48 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
But it isn't about the hours, it's about the results.
00:09:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if they're really good at what they do, you know, if you're just paying like, it's a flat rate, here's the job. Do you agree to accomplishing this job? for this amount of money and you know so it's you know per the project or whatever you can do that and there's a lot of people with that skill now you know now versus three years ago four years ago 10 years ago like it's so much different yeah um so but you being sharp on this and the extra money coming in um the tea money I feel like is for sure going to come in don't know what the titans numbers look like but you guys have been pretty steady you've learned about what the bootcamp does you're doing the podcast app you didn't leave any notes about that so I'd love to know about that but it feels like you're leveraging and you're building this um financial kind of moat and hedge that could support you having a small surgical strike team for yourself yeah um I have thought about just needing just getting one other person like a copywriter
00:11:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
down the road if because I'm thinking like I could do that I could get another time like I could manage that and I would bring on somebody to help with that and but I don't feel ready to take that step and go out and pursue that just yet but it's on my mind and I've got a few people in mind that I would reach out to that I feel like I could get a it wouldn't be hard to get a yes from them and they would well I guess I don't know if they would pay five grand but I was like that that's gonna be my my minimum that's gonna be my to do what I do and cuz like it Like I put my whole My brain into this and like I consume all their go through all their courses and you know the to just learn the product and I just feel like the level of service that I Bringing in the the copy that I fruit not just a copy of just like thinking through like I put the whole promotion or the bonuses and like all this Like the whole package like it's Yeah, I just realized like that that's what I am gonna do. That's what I'm gonna want to do because I feel like that's gonna Give us the best chance of succeeding and so for that You know, I'm grand Which I think is an insane deal and bargain Which is why I was talking about when I was talking about the profit sharing and I was talking about a flat rate of five grand plus
00:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you know a percentage of like a very tiny percentage like maybe even one percent of the net profits from the promo.
00:13:09 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Like not a business just from the promo like a performance bonus. Yeah, that could be a possibility. And they're great guys. It's 10 and I don't know if they're super great and laid back. And they're very hands off. know, this is awesome. They don't get in my way.
00:13:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean you've earned that too with who you are. You have a reputation, you're in an environment where you are positioned as an authority and so but there are people you know that they do know how to do that research and spend that time studying everything I think a lot of the female copywriters are probably more in line to do that and not charge a whole lot but there's also a lot of copywriters who just aren't they're not marketers for themselves so they can sell everybody else's stuff but themselves so they don't charge the highest rates they don't ask super high fees and but they just want consistent work and they want to work with good people that don't abuse them these copywriters who get abused a lot like they're responsible for all the sales even if there's crappy product bad people who don't know how to manage their business give good information, um, they're lying about what they're trying to sell, like all kinds of things, right? But it's a copywriter's job to make everything work. That and the media buyers, like that's it, some of the most ridiculous kind of expectations that are put on those type of people. But for you, like, if you had, let's say, two more clients and then you wouldn't want to do them back to back go in for yourself and really know their stuff inside out. Um, you know, like, I don't like to stack on new clients all at once because I, I, I dream about everything. Like, that's how much it's in my head because I don't know things yet. And my brain can't stop thinking about it because I have all these questions until I have a really good view of things or a good enough view. literally can't rest mentally. because I'm still trying to work it out and process it. And so, you're going and you're learning all these things. And I know your brain is always going. You're always thinking about stuff. So you had to kind of keep that in mind. But if you set the intention of trying to find somebody that you can work with that chart is a lot less than you do, that can do some different stuff, like maybe you give them an assignment of going through all these sales pages, all these email sequences and coming back and giving me a report. What this is, give me a few samples. instead of digging into all the different sources, you can just look at this. Maybe it's a document with a snapshot of here's a here's a literal picture of some of the copy from the website, some of the copy from the thank you page, some of the copy from the email sub all in one thing. So that's saving you time from click, click, click, click, click, right? But also what you know is that they've actually been into it, they've actually looked at it, and they've given you a report back and said, okay, here's what I see, right, this is a weak spot that they have, right, they're really not highlighting their USP, they really don't have a good hook, but here's a hook I did find, here's, you know what I mean, there's a process, and if you're looking at doing this for another 10, 20 years, 30, whatever, like I would imagine that long, I would like to see you make enough money where you can just start investing at your money's working for you. But you're going to be doing this for a long time anyway, so you really should be sending an intention of, I've got a solid junior copywriter or two that I'm working with who are, you know, really happy to be working with me because I'm a good guy and I'm not going to get them bad clients, I'm going to give them, you know, as consistent work as possible, but they're still contractors, which means you're not their financial protector. looks like maybe is it a male or female is it there's a lot of childless women in the copy world I don't know you know but there are and they also do not charge the same kind of rates as their male counterparts they're very loyal they're incredibly smart and and they love working for really great people you're the type of person that would that they would love working with and working for so that's something that you can kind of just tuck in your cap and know um kind of set a magnet out you know looking for that because you've come across them throughout the talking you've mentioned this person that person whatever and I'm like that's very interesting to me because I've been noticing it more and more so anyway those are just some things to think about because you're right on that press this. It's going to be one day you're like, okay, it's time to pull the trigger. And that's very soon. Especially with the results you got with that promo.
00:20:09 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I know, I know. well, I just turned out, yeah, yesterday, today's Wednesday, Monday, that there were three more new call appointments that came in last week for this week. they're using for the offer that I wrote. And they're using on their sales calls, the offer, the whole promo that I put together. Because before it was just here's an eight week course. We do weekly calls. And I turned it into this. Well, not an intern. Communicated what it actually was is not like I created something. It's just like they got so much more than just like an eight-week Course and yeah, but they would just we're doing a disservice and Leaving money on the table talking about it. Yeah, and now I'm working on this new promo, which is really cool It's all about how to turn switch your gym to is what's called a semi semi-private model and So it's like a hybrid of one-on-one and small group, but it's a four to six People in a class, but each one's got it their own individual customized workout and Like that's the model that Tim runs in his gym and they just you charge like a hundred bucks a week um for this kind of special specialized attention and community and You know at that at that rate like just to get to half a million in a year, you need less than 100 members doing a semi-private model and so it's, mean, can probably tell it's interesting to me because I'm into fitness, I don't really want to start a gym or anything, but it's interesting getting to know this market. And like just understand their financial issues and then now helping them make this switch to doing a semi-private model and seeing like how lucrative that can be for somebody who really is passionate about you coaching somebody and their fitness journey.
00:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, go ahead, keep on.
00:23:02 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
But like I was working on this promo today, I just went through all the training material, and that's the initial hook or headline that I'm working around. I'm going to write tomorrow morning around this idea, but it's something around how to build a $500,000 a year business with less than a hundred members, a $500,000 a year gym business with less than a hundred members. Something in that ballpark is where I'm thinking that that will be the hook, and then the sales letter describes how that happens.
00:23:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you happen to know the attrition rate?
00:23:48 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Not off the top of my head, but oh, for semi-private, it's not as high as tradition. like control access.
00:24:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow, so that's a hook right there. Yeah, that's a that's a massive hook right there because I would think it would be higher because of the amount of money. No, that means if I'm a business owner and I read that, I'm like, yeah, but like, how many people do I actually have to, how many times do I have to fill in that hundred, you know, like, and not everybody because I don't think everybody thinks about attrition, but I do. So, but anyway, but again, we'll have the numbers tell the story for you. Right, because it's a really powerful thing to say you only have to get 100 yeses, right, 100 people to say yes to this offer. don't need to get, you know, 500 or 1000 people like it's 100. And if the attrition rate, let's say it's 40%, you know, 140 people to say yes, that still sounds very doable. You break that up across, you know, the months or whatever, like just if you show them how easy it is, if you're providing this offer, this service, and also if you could show them, you know, where does it work? Does it only work in metro areas? Does it work in rural areas? Does it work in certain areas that have a medium income of X or whatever? Like if you were to do some data like that and do some case studies, put that on the website, which of course that takes time to build and to to see because it's a newer type of offer. But that's something that you can be working on with Tim and say, look, these are all the things that like basically build yourself a job for the next year. Like this is what we're building, this is what we're working on. We have to be getting these case studies. We're going to continue to get this data, but the data is going to continue to change as more people are doing it. going to get more information. But either way, like it's already paying for itself over and over again. And so get on board.
00:26:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Let's do this stuff.
00:26:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And yeah, but you could also be in terms of like you always want to be giving back to people. You be changing the fitness industry where people actually might be showing up more consistently because they're actually getting one on one health customized health. It's semi-private. So, you know, they're not paying as much as they would. So it's a little like, but that's not the word restrictive. And, you know, it could be making something really great, more available to more people than it was, but also allowing the trainers and the gym members because they're working with more people consistently because you're helping them stay full, be able to sharpen their saws and get better at what they do. So, like, just a little criss over here with a copywriting $5,000 a month. But I was just like taking over making a huge difference in the world. to me, that's the kind of stuff I love about what I do in my business. And maybe nobody else is acknowledging the impact that you're making. But if you look at it, that's a huge impact.
00:27:16 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Totally. And I mean, really, the comparison, guess, the Apple, it'd be more Apple's to comparison my private to one-on-one personal training.
00:27:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah.
00:27:30 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know, as I was thinking about it. Definitely. But there are, like I knew once that like orange theory, their average, do you know orange theory? No. that would be considered a large group model so that you go from station to station. Okay. So everybody's doing the same workout. You can have up to 30 people. know.
00:27:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like circuitry.
00:28:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I mean, but that's right now. Yeah, exactly. Okay. Um, so that'd be a large group model. And you can, you know, that you can make more than just doing like a general admission gym doing by having these larger groups. But like orange theory, they're, uh, uh, what's the word I'm looking for? The people leave on average after three or four months, their memberships last so long. usually it's not that, not that long. Um, but what ends up happening with, uh, semi-private is there's a, there's there's a onboarding, like there's a way that Tim sells it because I've gone through his training and, um, he, he kicks off the semi-private by bringing, he has a, an event because of the state of the union. as Jim, and he just brings in members and holds this two-hour event, and he just lets know where the fitness industry is going, then he introduces, he's got this whole script of how you introduce semi-private and compare it to one-on-one, but it's not as expensive as one-on-one, and then he's got two different ways he does contracts with people when they come in, so it's like, he's got a really solid team. I forget where I was going with that, but I do want to talk a little bit about Titans, switching gears, like Brian, he's been laying a little low. We've got the Over-Deliver Bootcamp coming up next month, and I'm I had a call with him. Oh, it his past Monday we met and he's having a procedure done on his on his heart. He shared with me a small, like outpatient, he said, but he's been having not, he said, I'm not going into a fib, which he was doing that like all the time before his last surgery, but he would he call it. Not palpitations or rhythmia, maybe.
00:30:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what it was, I think.
00:30:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
you know, he's, he's, and he was apologetic. He's like, I know, I've been, he owes me things and I figured something was going on because he's, he's usually faster to respond. you've watched him withdraw and then seen why he withdraws. Mm hmm. Um, and I brought up, I said, we haven't talked about this event in a while, and last time we spoke like we were doing it in January, and he was like, ah, don't know. He started doing this thing that he does. And, um, he, you know, he's using, this is going to sound more, I don't know, know, to come across this way, but he's using his health as an excuse to not really think about the, the event and, and plan that. So, whether that's, you can say it's legit, like, all right, if you need to do that, then that's totally fine. And I'll just, I'll just accept that, like, that's It's what he needs to do, because I'm not going to tell him, you know, uh, the alternative, I guess, but, but it just got me thinking because then he was like, you know, I don't know, like January of 2026, we could do this event, but I was just like, you know, it since Monday, I just, I've always, um, I've always just felt like I'm on this little bit of a roller coaster. With Brian in terms of like how he wants to show up, and, you know, get, and he even told me, he's like, you know, I'm like two or three times your age, and, and I'm like, you know, there's going to be probably in the near future where he just wants to not do this anymore.
00:32:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so that's where I'm pretty new. Like he's been sun setting for a while.
00:32:52 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:32:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Sorry, I didn't want to cut you off like I just, but that's, that is the thing. that we've been watching and there is, you know, there are kind of, at the very least right now, two things to look at. You have great respect and reverence for Brian and appreciation for him and overall this is his business. However, you have been deeply invested in it, you have nurtured it, you have been the primary reason for not only its growth, but its maintenance for probably the last four years or so. Whenever he had a stroke, I feel like it was around 2020, that wasn't it? It was around there, yeah. And you have not only been invigorating to his business, but you have been invigorating to his life. And it's not even about feeling entitled to any particular thing. even though you've earned stuff, it's that the writing is on the wall that Brian's pace is probably permanently changed. ability, like his fire is flickering. It's not extinguished. It bursts up a little bit. It goes down a little bit based on health, life circumstances, but it has definitely altered significantly, and I would be shocked if it's not permanently. I know he's a peptide, I do believe that there are miraculous things that can happen. I don't think Brian has the willpower and the drive inside of him to drive to it. He doesn't seem like a hardcore driven person anymore. Like I think that part has flickered out and been replaced by family and life, which is okay. But... I think that that was a priority shift that changed permanently. And if he truly does have everything that he needs set aside financially, that he doesn't have to make more money, then that has to come into it too. And you are just hitting your stride of like, I am a business man. I got skills, I can bring money, I can grow, and all of these other people, there's a market that is begging to be served, quality content, quality service. I'm here to do it, you know, and now you're being throttled. You've been throttled. You've been throttled since I met you with Brian not showing up. And this is with all due respect. It isn't about bad-mouthing him for it.
00:35:53 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I mean, we've had this conversation many times. We don't really need to say it, but I do.
00:35:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's just a real- be difficult situation to be in. So back to, you know, what can you do? I think, at some point, like, I think you really have to keep leaning into building the thing that you build, and pacing stuff out, and letting go of like, don't even try to plan events with Brian, you know, I just, because it will, you deserve to not be frustrated, but also the power of that frustration can be so detrimental to your happiness, to your peace, to your productivity, and all of your happiness and peace impacts how you show up as a dad. And even if it's just a slight diminishing, it's going to be perpetual because this is the pattern that Brian has over and over again, commit to something, doesn't do it for really valid reasons in terms of like, you know, but it, but that, that is what it is. So I would be looking for, how do we nurture Titans, Accelerator, and as with as little dependence upon Brian as possible, what does that model look like, where it's at the very least maintaining its revenue for you and for him, very at the very least maintaining its value and reputation, which I think that you can do like you could probably do all the over delivered book camps by yourself and people still feel good because you're showing up in the Titans world so much and so many of them are so new that and you've been there since day one, that's potentially it. You know, something to think about along that path but really just how do you build it independent of Brian where he can be like, surprise, I'm here. Yeah, everybody. I did not be, but nothing that requires he has to show up. think there's still a lot of financial potential for you, where that's not stressful. Because the other option is, like, can I at leaving, giving an ultimatum of like, this is how it's going to be, or maybe just give me a higher percentage because this is a lot to deal with, and also give me more power over what happened without having to get your approval, because you're bottlenecking and I'm trying to build and grow. And I understand why you're doing it. You've got real needs, but so do I. Like, I'm in business and I might give half at least of my time to this. anyway, that's a lot to think about. It's a lot to process. But maybe that's just something that you can work through because you tend to really Defer to just supporting Brian and just being like it is what it is and not taking care of yourself the way that you ought to and advocating for yourself. And I think that you should advocate for yourself I think that you have more than earned it. And it isn't just advocating for yourself, but the business and the customers that you serve, they need stability and reliability also.
00:39:30 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Well, you know, we're doing rolling out two things inside of TXL that I think is going to help with retention. One is you know about the public podcast, the timeless marketing and that's more about bringing people in, but we were also putting all the calls from TXL into a private podcast. Podcast. that only members can access, and so that's going to make it easier for everybody to be able to access the call recordings right from their phone, like inside the Apple podcast app or Pocketcast or whatever podcast app they use. And the other one is we're starting accountability pods within the group that's led by the members. And so they'll have a set schedule that they meet on. You know, they'll be independent of our two to three calls a month. And so the hope there is that that's going to help foster the community and get people connected. You'll hold people accountable to reaching the goals that they have. Those two things are giving or rolling out the podcast I'll announce, probably before July 4th, pods, I put the initial plan together and sent to Brian and this one of the things he owes me, all in feedback on, but I've been thinking, like don't feel anger or fear, I feel little after that call with Brian, but I've just kind of been thinking like, all right, I want to keep TX all going and I want to keep growing, break through advertising. And in the long term, I still would like to, you know, be a part of break through advertising for forever. you know, whenever the point comes of like Brian passes away, you know, we'll have, whenever Jean's wife Barbara passes away is when we'll because her son will get it. Yeah. Yeah. At that point.
00:42:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How old is she?
00:42:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh, she's like 90 something. Wow. Yeah. She's, she's up there, but, um, yeah, and not rocking the boat, you know, when, when there's that kind of investment and, and I, it's not a just selfish, like I go, wait for him to die and I get this kind of thing.
00:42:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not that it's, I mean, all these relationships are nuanced, um, but that goes back to how do you nurture titans, independent. of Brian where he can just you know show up and less it when he wants to and can but that the stability of it is anchored on the things that you do steadily so that you know it's there you're taking care of he's taking care of and the market is taking care of like I think that you've gotten the ability to do that and I think that just not trying to have big events but I realize that there was a big part of it there's a lot of potential for it there's a lot of connection but but based off of every single year there's been something that has for the last four years at least that has really just been overwhelming for Brian and he's had to pull back for a while so and an event takes months and he he always, for the last few years, has seemed to be, and even before, you know, four years ago, in the beginning, you were like, he wants to get out of the masterminds, like the in-person stuff. So, he's been pulling steadily back out of showing up in person and overcommitting to things for years. That's just not, I can't see that changing. So, to even consider doing something like that and hoping it's going to be able to come to fruition, first of all, could be really detrimental to the brand because people get excited and they want to have it. And then, you know, can only get disappointed so many times before you like tease. Almost, you know, they're hardcore people. and it didn't hurt his brand. Well, you can't say that. But die-hard fans will stay die-hard fans.
00:44:59 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know what I mean? Yep.
00:45:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But that's not all you have in the market. And that's not the only people seeing the stuff that happens. It's also the new people coming in. And so just kind of taking that into account. I think that you can create the thing that just maintained a steady pace where you get to grow and serve the market and just kind of wait for the inevitable, even if it takes years, whether it's Jane's wife or Brian. But I think that compartmentalizing and just kind of putting titans into, putting TXL into like a portion of your day, portion of your week and really focusing on everything else that you're building would be really wise for you.
00:45:52 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Well, and the good thing about that is, you know, like, we do Do you have a small team that really runs?
00:46:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:46:06 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know, and like the social media posts, the podcasting, the, you know, Jamie's handling all the tech stuff. Carlin and Margie are handling the renewals, TXL renewals. You got Jeremy and they're working with you too, right?
00:46:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's that? You got Jeremy Weiss and that makes two.
00:46:30 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, for the podcast. Yeah. And, you know, that's that's humming along and.
00:46:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So big change from this time last year.
00:46:46 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, it's a big change and I feel like. There needs to be a way like to, I mean, I guess maybe it's just. I think that the area of improvement is running a regular promotion for TXL, which we just haven't been doing, and I was thinking about that because I was like, we're going to do this event coming up, and yeah, that is definitely on me getting these promotions running. I think part of it is like it's, it's not painful, but I can't think of the word, it's painful. it. That's That's That's That's That's That's And maybe that's not even what I'm trying to say. I think maybe it's like, we've been, I've put so much effort into putting the team together. I guess now is the point where I can look up and say, right, let's run some promotions. my mind just has not been on running promotions for TXL for whatever reason. And I think what I have in mind is like, we're gonna run these boot camps. Cause I know we're gonna do one next month, we'll do another one in the fall for breakthrough advertising. And that'll be how we bring them up.
00:48:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so the boot camps we know has a super high conversion rate, but they're also more work. It's a whole kind of thing, right, to build. But with the podcast now, you have Evergreen stuff, which is what we're talking about. And I don't know what you have going on, but. Um, there are like, I can think of Jeff Roning as an example with, um, whatever his webinar platform as I can't remember what it is. But, and there's some other people where they, um, are constantly promoting it and then send you to a page and it's like, it's closed. Um, but we'll open eventually, put us in your information and get on a waiting list. And so it feels like there's this scarcity. But really like magically 48, 24 hours later, you get a thing, hey, a spot opened up. Um, so there's that type of thing or there's just, you could just have an evergreen offer. And the scarcity is you don't have any more time to waste doing stupid stuff in your business. You don't have any more time to waste, not having a community support you. You don't have any more time to waste doing less than you could be doing. So, you know, instead of being just signing about it or super highly marked. reading about it, whatever, you just be like, this is the thing, you know, this is an exclusive group. We show up steadily. This is not like, if you're looking for XYZ, you know, high peace, slimy, marketing, get rich quick, selling lotto tickets, selling diet pills, meaning promised results that don't actually work and your odds of winning are next to nothing. Don't come in here, we don't want you. But if you want timeless skills, proven tactics, and you're willing to shock, do the work, wear your people, and you should come in here. And it's, you know, at the end of every episode or in the middle or front, middle end of the episodes, whatever. And then you just promote the podcast all over the place. Instead of promoting accelerator, let the podcast show the intelligence and the smarts and all the other things. and say also do you want to actually talk to us in person here so how many podcasters do you get to talk to in person how many people that you listen to as a mentor do you actually get to work with like this is your chance so it could be a very simple marketing campaign that is actually directed at guests right because they see you out there marketing which means they're going to be promoted higher quality guests better content better service to your people better reasons for them to go I got to get in there yep you know just looking we've got we've got a couple of like ad bumps in the podcast the one at the end we'll take listen to a basically
00:52:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
TXL Quiz, and then that puts them into our, if they're a new subscriber, they get welcome sequence and then promotions for TXL and boot camps. But let's see, that puts this quiz, 37, well 37 finished, but only 17 subscribed at the end, 51 started, 37 finished, 17 subscribers, so far.
00:52:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many people have seen it?
00:52:54 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
51.
00:52:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's a good conversion rate. How many people heard the offer to take the quiz?
00:53:07 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I don't know because that comes at the end of the episode. don't know.
00:53:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you get listening analytics?
00:53:20 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I know.
00:53:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there any way to get that?
00:53:25 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I can email Jeremy with that.
00:53:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to put this podcast in and out. But the conversion rate of how many people actually went there versus how many took it. And then how many subscribed?
00:53:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's pretty good. Yeah. So it's. In in like now we're doing and this is just not even a month old now every Wednesday Brian is mailing the list Sending people directly to the to an episode And I that you know that's all the may see and Apple in the Philippines I don't know if I told you I heard this girl named Apple It was a referral from Macy and she she's done pretty well. I trained I Created a right like Brian GPT. Oh, yeah, and She's been using that and then she sends her drafts to Brian Brian edits and and then they they take it I don't touch it at all It's great I love that Yeah, I'll imagine Yeah, yeah So, yeah, I think with Titans, I don't want to get, I guess, my mind, the question is like, all right, know that this runway will end at some point, but like, there's no reason that we can't just keep this community going for as long as Brian, because I think he kind doing these big events, it's like, you know, just doing a better job of maybe running some ads for the podcast, getting people engaging that way, bringing them in, and just doing it simple, and then adding these stick strategies that improve retention is maybe have a bigger... impact overall. But I, you know, talk about protecting my energy. It was something we've talked about a lot like, I'm feeling internally like how much do I want to put into growing titans beyond what it is already versus, you know, that I'm, I see the difference working with Tim and Tim is very like, he's in it, you know, he's driven and it's, it's just a different feeling being part of something like that. Yeah. And they're, they're just constant activity.
00:56:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
very energizing.
00:56:56 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:56:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not only protecting your energy, but feeding your
00:57:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
energy. Yeah, because he's like, you know, we got a, we got a row in the same direction, because we got goals, he's got this event. And it's like, so I, I, that's crossed my mind of like, all right, how do I, you know, manage this tightens, like, what is that going to be? you could just give it a certain amount of time, and you can set your big rocks and goals and say, okay, here are these things that have to converge.
00:57:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Number one, this is how much time and energy I'm willing to give it period and the story. In that time and energy, these are the most important things that have to get done. When the time is up, times up, I've gotten the most thing that can done, it'll be what it'll be. And sink or swim, whatever. If you, if it ends up that you'll Like it needs more and there's money for you, the higher more, but you don't want to give it more. Great. If it's giving a good return and now you want to give it more, give it more. If it's not working, then maybe it's time to have a new conversation and not worry about what you've lost and consider all the things that has fed you, trained you, molded you, shaped you, be grateful for that. thank you everyone because sometimes that needs to happen. There are seasons and sometimes the seasons end.
00:58:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's interesting they're just looking, yeah, this is 3, 4, 6, 3, 2, it's going to look because we, the other thing that has been interesting to watch is you were selling brick-thru advertising mastery on Amazon. And last week, or last month, we almost came close to being completely out of inventory. We sent 20 books at the end of and we were down to one book at the end of May. So I got 30 more. Let's see how many books we have left. So I sent them 30, and some 30 at the end of May. Alright, so we got 23. So we sold 7. But what I was getting at, so this year, I don't know, you gotta go. Let see how many books we sold total because the whole reason we did Amazon was to see if people would buy it and then opt in. So this year total we've generated 23 leads from Amazon whether these are not leads or buyers, but we sold to find this right report here. Let me see how many books we sold. Oh, here we go, me see. Here we go, go, we we we we we go, here we go, here we go, we go, here Uh, the seller central is, um, sales dashboard.
01:02:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There you go.
01:02:12 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You're not here today. I'll do that.
01:02:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's here today. Yeah, that's the same thing as you're today.
01:02:27 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh, I guess I was thinking it would take me back 12 months.
01:02:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I see.
01:02:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
All right. So let's see what we saw. 50, 50 units. And then all right. we're got about half, half of those buyers who opted in. Okay. Um, so what was that last year this time? We weren't on Amazon this time last year.
01:03:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:03:05 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. And we've got ads running on Amazon and those are, let's see.
01:03:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you able to, like, do you tag those opt-ins and can you tell if any of them have purchased Titans Accelerator?
01:03:21 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, we tag them. Oh, God. It started. Keep is forcing two-factor authentication.
01:03:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Starting today.
01:03:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I hate it.
01:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh Do you want to do any of these tags instead of all? No? Oh, never mind.
01:04:37 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Got you got you got you Yeah, I just want to see Anybody to oh no, that's when oh, okay, Tom pools with a real person so one That's that pays out, you know, yeah, that's not Uh Unprofitable And the ads we'll see here the ads have done well to you on Amazon. Oh, here we go We're just doing like yeah 12 bucks a Measurement before Oh This looks 14 sales, this is over this is this year Yeah, all right guys, this is this year So we spent 1400 and we sold 2100 Yeah, so I mean Amazon's been doing well, you're just like, okay, yeah, I mean, what, that's six, seven hundred dollars, it's how much effort does do you put into it, nothing, it's just kind of set it and forget it. Oh, nothing. Yeah, that's good. I I ship, I get a book shipped to them.
01:06:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many people is that? How many customers? Oh, you said it was like 50.
01:06:37 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, this year is like 50, 51. And I found a, well, didn't find it, but the guy who helped me set up the Amazon seller central here, he, I put him on a project to help me find a cheaper printer. For BAM, get down one. in China. I'm meeting with them maybe tonight. But I've already got a copy of the book that they printed for me so I could see their quality and it's really good. I sent it to Brian. He likes it. Of course, he's not sure about printing in China. But it's shipped here. It's less than 10 bucks a book.
01:07:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you were talking about that a while ago.
01:07:35 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
And looking into it. Yeah. I mean, unless I see a major red flag, I want to do it because like that's huge savings. Instant, you know, uh, and I'm.
01:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So glad you started the doc because I feel like we'll get better traction this month, just being able to have some back and forth. But I would really, really like you to consider. And I'm sorry, my daughter came in to see how long and then she let the dog in and he wants to. I don't know how long it's been since you've paid attention to your time and done any time tracking, but it might be good to do a little inventory on where time is going. And especially for summer and maybe just every summer kind of do that although it's going to change with the kids but with that being a teacher, you know it's kind of a good idea to have an idea of how does your schedule change during the summer. And so go ahead and just kind of do a time inventory tracking little bit just it's going to be roughly don't have to do it perfect but just really just pay attention to your time. Where it's going, especially with having the different things going on with tea And that potentially creeping up a little bit, but probably having a good return Seeing what you might want to change in your devotion to it You might want to increase it if it gets out on clickbank and it's doing well I know they're the marketing guys, but you know get your brain on it and going you know what I know some stuff to you Let me put some of this on it put some gasoline on it cuz it's actually really doing good Um stuff you're doing with him potentially getting one more new client to get that extra $5,000 a month buffer But then also making sure you've got time to think about Potentially having conversations with junior copywriters, whatever. So really looking at it and kind of Choosing a pace for the summer choosing the the main goals for the summer what you'd like to accomplish and also in Goals for the family like family trips whatever stuff you guys want to do and just really kind of you know how we've done our time blocking like out in advance. I would love you to kind of try to like if you just spent a few days this week through next week looking at what would I like to get done throughout the summer put them in this spreadsheet with the weeks out right and put the big rocks in there right we're vacation all week not barely touching anything or boot camp whatever like really get the chunks down all through the rest of the summer and then show that to me so that I can look at it with you and just go okay here's some new thoughts about how to part of it will be about how do we how do we give Titans a container that you feel good about but also that you're like okay inside of this can't container I'm going to maximize everything and you get the best but when that containers full, then I get to go play in my other playgrounds, which I'm really enjoying, and you know, so that you don't feel this burden or any building resentment as a result of it, because that does happen. And if you put it into a specifically chosen container, that should reduce the ability and the likelihood of having resentment build up about it, because you've put it where you want it to be and what you're okay with.
01:11:34 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Make sense? Yep.
01:11:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. So just because like we're already getting into July, and you know, that time goes really fast, especially with the kids, and I'm just getting older and faster and faster and faster, I would recommend scheduling out, you know, super rough draft, not major detail. The rest of your summer light that soon, and
01:12:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
and share it with me. OK, I'm in and knowing that. Sheet for myself. We packed a lot into in the May and June or the verification and.
01:12:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, fun.
01:12:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)

All of them. Yeah, I like.
00:00:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love them. They're awesome. I told you I got to meet Esther right on the first call. No. Yeah, so we were talking and I thought I had seen somebody walking in the background, but the background was blurred. So it was hard to tell. And then he's talking about family stuff and he's like, yes, she's my wife. She's right here. And so she came and she sat down and she just talked to me and told me how excited she was for the coaching and. told me, you know, stuff about him and it was it was not what normally happens, but I loved it because like families are really what I'm thinking about most of the time. I'm just getting to it to the business. It's just weird. But anyway, that's me. So that was really cool.
00:01:20 - mark sweet
Yeah. And she's super techy, super smart.
00:01:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you said that. And she's incredibly gorgeous.
00:01:27 - mark sweet
Oh my gosh. I just like the whole family.
00:01:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yeah, they have amazing energy. Sorry.
00:01:36 - mark sweet
wish I had like, you know, 200 of those funds for you because you would be the happiest person in the world.
00:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I would be so happy. A few and far between on people like him that exist, unfortunately. Yeah, but that's why you learn to recognize them as gems when you get them. They're like, yeah, you're not normal. And my favorite thing, one of my favorite things to tell people like that. is how special they are, because a lot of times they just have no idea, they just think, you know, whatever, they usually think way less of themselves than the people who are way worse. All right, let me get my notes.
00:02:17 - mark sweet
Yeah, the other new one, I'm talking to her husband, I guess, on Tuesday?
00:02:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

I was when I was talking to Fuji. I've been doing more so I typically don't do video calls but I've been trying to incorporate them more often especially with newer people just to get kind of like a baseline reading on people. So again that's how I got to see. Actually I was an on video at that time so Esther didn't get to meet me but anyway it adds a different layer of connection. It's just good. Where is my document? I was trying to get them. I have three minutes to get ready and then you were there early. I'm like, oh, just like Damon. Let's see. Oh, what I want to do is because I keep asking the question and I don't want to keep asking the question. Oh, I do have it. Okay, I just need to update this. So sweet little attorneys, who is doing Missouri cases? Does that just you or Patrick?
00:04:25 - mark sweet

Right. Okay.
00:05:48 - mark sweet
Samantha is too. Right.
00:05:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Texas. that's just you.
00:05:54 - mark sweet
Okay. We have her applying for Illinois, Colorado.
00:05:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know. So let me. But that is. You're getting questions. And Nick is working on Washington and he's going to take the Arizona bar in February.
00:06:20 - mark sweet
Patrick is going to take the Nevada bar in February and Hank is going to take the Georgia bar in February.
00:06:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice. Yeah, because I was just thinking about this earlier this morning. Um, especially after seeing your the, you know, the month to date and looking at. where, or did I paste that in here yet? on a second. Oh my gosh, zoom is in my way. There it is. Copy. Just thinking about what we're working on in terms of leveraging existing assets and resources but expanding revenue and growth and not necessarily having to get new lead sources because that's what's difficult. So this is our strategy of expanding out into the states. But then I was thinking about making sure that I can track, first of all, who's in each of the states and the way I spelled that. And then just kind of looking at, so like we had three Missouri this month. And when we're talking about the pace that we've been growing, that three, know, that starts getting us some momentum. Even though it's not huge, we're only halfway through the month, that's significant. we started, if we got six more in Missouri every month, which I don't know that we would, but you know, it's just, it's just talking about the potential math, not the probable math. Sure. Looking at that. then also though, who's in Missouri, so if it's just Patrick, but you can do Missouri also, right?
00:08:36 - mark sweet
I'm the only one licensed in Missouri.
00:08:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So how is it that Patrick can do it because he's working it up and you're technically the attorney?
00:08:45 - mark sweet
Yeah. So like, you know, Sam's not licensed in Washington, but she's working on Washington in case it's undermining.
00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mark. Okay, because I want to also kind of keep an eye on the ceiling that might be arriving and reading so we don't have a dashboard for this type of thing so I'm just gonna kind of use a spreadsheet and this is going to have to improve over time but with you know not February is a ways away but we've got how many bars coming up at least three three yeah so three potential will see easy is not at all like end of May if they passed or not
00:10:00 - mark sweet
it takes a while.
00:10:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Okay. about a year. And that's so Georgia, Nevada is not new though.
00:10:11 - mark sweet
You waved in Nevada, right? Nope. I can't. We've been in Nevada.
00:10:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:10:17 - mark sweet
We had a Nevada bar issue, which is probably why it's on your head.
00:10:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So nobody is in Nevada.
00:10:25 - mark sweet
You can't do Nevada cases right now, right?
00:10:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Correct. Okay. So Nevada would be a new, newly opened. Yep. Can anybody work in Georgia right now? Nope. Okay. So Georgia would be a new open.
00:10:39 - mark sweet
And then it would be brand new Illinois would be brand new.
00:10:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. So I'm also glad though that we're getting started with the attorneys and it would be good. You know, I don't know when still, but talking with the intake team. Just building up. up kind of that momentum because if we're talking about getting into one, two, four, five new states in May, potentially.
00:11:10 - mark sweet
Yes, potentially.
00:11:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But we're shooting for it even if it's three new states and let's say the three new states could get us six new cases every month each. If we got 18 new cases retainers every month and that would be. So matter is matters everything and retainers are because there's people retainers.
00:11:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Huh? Matters are retainers.
00:11:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:11:44 - mark sweet
What Mark? Incidences is when it's the lower number.
00:11:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Incidences is the number of right? Right, right. Okay. Okay. Got it. Right. So, um, Anyway, but if we're getting, I'll just stick with retainers, because that's the number that we're tracking for the most part, like 18 new retainers every month. And then there's the compounding effect of those are open cases that are being worked for a period of a few months actively before they, you know, get to where they start to slow down a little bit. With the amount of attorneys that we have right now, like that, that ceiling will get there faster. So I just want to start plotting the course out and thinking about it because we're also still trying to increase how many retainers we're getting each month. Now, while everybody's still pretty busy right now. Lorenz is kind of capped. So anyway, just making sure that I'm getting all of the data points and that we're really looking at everything all the way around and massaging what we can trying to get and optimizing and getting more. out of what we have leveraging it, but also anticipating that at some point there's probably going to be another ceiling. We're going to have to probably hire other attorneys, but I don't know.
00:13:14 - mark sweet
Anyway, so I was just thinking about 150 retainers a month for you now. We've got five main pods, I'll call it.
00:13:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the thing with that though is that's a very basic and generic number spread across your pods when all your pods do not function the same and they don't all operate in same states.
00:13:37 - mark sweet
So while that I mean that math to me is like not even dirty that's just right so it's so we're just going to stay with Arizona. Arizona only goes busy enough to keep him solid. Hank with being relatively you know, we can give him other states to work on. He doesn't have to just only be Arizona. He's losing Arizona, he's licensed in Arizona, but you know, clearly he wants to take the Georgia bar and he's open to do another things. You don't know if he's been an attorney long enough that he can wave into some of these states, but if he does well in the Georgia bar, you can wave into some of these states as well. Okay. So, you know, I can see him eventually taking cases or New Mexico cases.
00:14:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:14:51 - mark sweet
Our short term issue is we're spending more we're bringing in, which is never good. So, you know, we Got to keep our group.
00:15:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:15:09 - mark sweet
I'm waiting for it to catch up. know it will catch up. Give me now of cases that we're signing.
00:15:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's just. And that big settlement that you just had the dad not help.
00:15:20 - mark sweet
Balance about that gets us back to even plus 500 grand basically. So, I mean, it was in a good position. It's not like it's a bad position. But obviously I would hope that that money would have gone a lot further.
00:15:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, so if you forecast, if you, I mean, you can forecast at this point, right, to some to a pretty solid degree. So, what happens when you forecast it out, right? It's you should be able to say, Hey, like I just did this for us, right? I forecasted. that we will hit our subscriber ceiling, I forget what day I did this on, but it was 155 days from the day that I did it. And then at our meeting this morning, we are 30 shy of hitting that ceiling. And when that happens, that's it. We're not going to get any more revenue unless we change something, right? So in our scenario, I have to change new customer, the new customer metric, which is I'm working on that, right? That's the only path to growth. Same thing with you, right? The path to growth is more retainers. But in my forecast, our overhead doesn't change, right? So it's like, we just won't make more money. We lose customers, we make less. But if we say here, it's like, we're just going to get stuck. And what I figured out was when we zoomed out, like when I zoomed out, which will be different for you, right? When I zoomed out, was like, oh, really don't work. really just kind of stuck for lack of a bit of word or no, it's actually true. Like we're just stuck at around three million, you know, 2.8 to 3.2 million a year. Like we just float in and out of that zone, throwing in the global pandemic. So it's like, okay, if nothing changes, if actually not nothing, if that new customer metric does not change, nothing else will change, we can just stay like this. for you, it's like, okay, how do you forecast this stuff? Because this is the scenario, like, it just made me think of, oh, it's my buddies, even knows this. I don't think I told you the story. So in, yeah, in January, my buddies like, oh yeah, we're gonna triple the business and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 60 days later, he was laying on top of stuff because he, and I swear, Tina, up. And it was, Because his, he forecasted improperly and like was using some math magic, some really happy math. I was like, Hey, man, I don't know about this. And within 60 days, he was asked out completely upside down, laid off after staff, and is now still playing catch up. So that was in March. And he's kind of, he's treading water now, but they're about to lay off like their number one salesperson. The benefit of it was, I mean, I don't know if there really was a benefit, I guess there was, is like, now he's really digging into like the inner numbers, right? He's not just looking at the surface level things. He's going deeper on these numbers. And he's also figuring out that certain processes don't work that great. But here, it's like, what's if you forecast that, what actually shows you what's going to happen. That's the concern I have it's like okay if I look when when when is that what is that horizon like oh yeah we're gonna be back we're gonna be in the black whatever you want to call it in 140 days because xyz is gonna happen based off of all this data I mean you have years and years with the data granted you do have growth that's happening over here but and never assume growth I would never unless rock solid yeah how'd we look at that looking at it if I use a hundred retainers and I would throw out the person outlier cases to me those aren't real those are just creepy yeah I can't rely on those no I'm looking at a hundred incidences or sorry a hundred retainers which were usually beyond but I think a hundreds of pretty solid number 15% between drop and sub-out rate which the real numbers 12 I'm using 15 as a
00:20:00 - mark sweet
conservative number. It consists of 85 cases that should pay out out of the market. If I use the $12,000 average fee, and I'm sure you remember we ran this a while ago, our average fee.
00:20:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yep, I use 11, yep, 21.
00:20:19 - mark sweet
Yeah, let's use 12 grand again, conservative, that should put us a little over a million. Our monthly overhead is around a million. fluctuates from month to month, but that's around where our breakeven points.
00:20:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Now, that's before.
00:20:36 - mark sweet
Yeah, is that we've sent out?
00:20:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Is your overhead increasing at the same rate? Like are you just creating more, but getting less, right? You create more revenue, but you're creating more overhead, right? Are these things just moving in conjunction? So your for your bottom line numbers going up, but that's it. you're not really making, you're not picking anything up for doing this other than more employees, more this, more that.
00:21:12 - mark sweet
Like, it's more, more, more, more, more, more, but what it's not more of is profit. Sure answer is yes. Long answer is yes with a butt. And the reason I'm saying Yes with what? A butt, because the answer is yes. But the more cases I have in my pipeline, the more value my firm has. The more I could theoretically decide tomorrow to stop advertising, right?
00:21:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
cut down people and The Salko model.
00:21:37 - mark sweet
Salko model. Two more cases you're bringing in the higher chances of getting one of those whales, right? Larger net. True. Catch a bigger fish.
00:21:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right, so that's all, all right. So, I mean, obviously, the Salko model I get, but that's like this long-term play. Are you really? I do you really think you're going to do that?
00:22:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't even think you wanted to go that way. So let's definitely talk this out.
00:22:10 - mark sweet
No, it's that or you sell.
00:22:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean, value your firm is in your case.
00:22:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Right. made the decision. I made the decision like 60, 90 days ago. Like when we got another PE firm come in and offer us a bunch of money, it wasn't enough money. But it was the first time ever that I was like, you know what? I would sell it now. So now I've shifted and my plan is to sell it in three years. Like I've set a time like in three years, I want to be I want to sell it. So I'm building it now and massaging it like getting I got this new bookkeeper and I'm getting a valuation done right now. We're setting up all new. We're setting up these docs. So I'm positioning it to sell and then I'm bringing in an advisor to help. to show me, hey, they sell these kinds of companies. So I'm engaging them now so that in three years, this thing is just shining and everything looks great. And then they're going to go selling. That's it. That's what I'm doing. It's happening. If it doesn't sell, I don't care. If I just make the business better, we make more money, that's not well and good. But my goal is really to sell it. If I just end up with a more profitable seven-figure business, oh, well. So I wonder if you should, I don't know, I mean, you could operate in those terms, right? And you'd be in this exact same position, right? be like, OK, well, I just made it all better and I'm going to keep it. But I'm doing all these things with this sort of thing in mind. And then what does that really look like? So for me, I know now, hey, I got to really figure out this new customer thing because that's where I'm going to add to the bottom line and therefore that's going to add to I know that that multiple whatever the multiple is that it's eight if I increase that metric that eight is worth more. The eight's only worth what it is right now like at a a 22 new customers a day average which is what we average no no matter what it's that times eight or that whatever the multiple is right so I go okay great if I want that multiple to have more value than I need to change this one metric so I'm only focused on figuring out how to change that metric so for you it's like what what does constitute the value right what does it what what would be the best looking version of it in three or four or five years whatever your horizon is and then how do you start to do things now to make it that then right is it and maybe it is you just keep doing this thing where you're going grow grow grow grow and like your profit margin doesn't change at all because that's how the multiple works there. I don't know, but something to think about.
00:25:08 - mark sweet
It's definitely something to think about. And again, the numbers that gave you were the most conservative numbers, right? the like Rosie everything's perfect. I use the 12% drops about rate, which is our actual rate, and that number should go down, and our 12,000, 684, 99 number, you know, now we're at 1.116. We make 100 grand a month, give or take, which, you know, it's not like that's insane, but it's not terrible. And that's not going to any referral fees or any big cases. So to me, it's keep growing and keep looking at what our average settlement is in these states. And are there any outliers that throw that number off? And then does it make sense, you know, take Washington, for example, does Washington still make sense in two or three years? Part of the problem is, We're spending a lot on the advertisement and it's taking a while to chase the tech.
00:26:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Is 10%, I mean, that's a 10 profit margin. Like, is that a good number? I don't even know. I don't know what the math is in this world.
00:26:16 - mark sweet
It should be about 20%.
00:26:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
10% when you're going through growth is so no.
00:26:22 - mark sweet
20% to 20% to a third is where you're really trying to be, depending on if you can do and what not. I would be perfectly fine with a 20% profit margin. I think that is fine.
00:26:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
All right. So are you not getting 20% now due to operational inefficiencies? Like, what's preventing you from getting 20% now? Is it because you're on this track of like, hey, that's just not possible because we're doing this thing? Or is it like, oh no, that should be possible right now.
00:26:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it your incentive program?
00:26:53 - mark sweet
The incentive program is not helping.
00:26:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We have high payroll.
00:26:58 - mark sweet
Okay. Our payroll is high. It should be like 25 to 28% and it's closer to like 37%. So our payroll is high because of current incentive package, right? that's mostly the attorneys. That's really where the money is going.
00:27:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:27:17 - mark sweet
Yeah. And obviously our advertising costs is high too. We're getting it better under control. But if I look at it for the year, we had some swings and misses. That we lost money on. Yeah. If I was better.
00:27:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. the payroll is like fixed.
00:27:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the real problem.
00:27:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Marketing's variable payroll is fixed. And then if the goal is this longer term thing, what you know, right? And I know, because I know the talk a model is that you would just eliminate marketing altogether because your firms then subsiding strictly on referrals. And blah, blah, blah, blah. And brand, right? Pray to some degree. That's interesting. So I've been going. I'm back and forth with the ad sergely guys because they're like, they don't understand why the conversion rate for sweet loss so much worse for lack of a better term than everyone else. Right. So that's why I was late because I was lacking with him. So he told me that he, and he showed me like all the metrics of these other firms. He's just not showing me their names. The firm in Washington that is that multi-state firm like they're closing 30% of the leads like, okay, great. And then the other firms in other states, the average is 14% and ours with them is somewhere like five, which is what we keep seeing over and over and over. My argument to him that I wanted to bring to you that ties directly into what we just talking about is I'm telling him Mark's criteria is different. They're signing lower value cases and they just, they either doing it on purpose or they just don't know. And he's like, well, that doesn't make sense. I got no .
00:29:00 - mark sweet
but I go it makes sense only in this way and I don't know if this is smart and so I'm gonna run this by mark and weirdly we just kind of kind of covered it like maybe they're doing it on purpose because they're trying to expand their user base right and that they're playing into this long-term model I don't believe that for a second because I think they're not doing the math it's not just that it's the difference between me and all these other firms is they look at is this a case and I made this one first started and a lot of the larger firms are guilty of this is this a case the answer that is yes for me it's is the lemon worth the squeeze and more often than not there is no for a lot of these other firms it's it's a case and it's a completely different mindset I could probably double what our retention rate is If I was not so picky, or I did not require so much information on fraud, I promise you that there are pieces where they don't know if there's insurance, they don't know any of the liability, they are more than like the property damage photos, and so they're drop rate.
00:30:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's what I think is happening. And I'm about to prove it to him, because I was pointing this out to him said, look at the turn down rates, there's a distinct, I don't know, no treatment, no injury. Unless somehow we're getting these very special leads, that exact percentage exists across everything, they are signing those. And my guess is if I go and do the math, let's say that our conversion rate with them is 7%, guess what the other 7% is going to be, those two reasons. And I'll be like, dude, if the math is right there, they're signing them. And it shouldn't be and that's the difference and so in that context It's like this is what I was saying to my go and I also told them the 30% Washington I'm like dude, they're referring those out. We don't count those. Yeah, they get tracked But they don't count because they're not real money. It's not a real real retainer So if you take those out of theirs That's probably gonna drop them down to like the 14% average my guess is that they I'm not my guess I saw it they'd refer a ton of them So they're signing crappy ones and that was must be extra crappy and then they were throwing them out. So with him like, okay, let's get to What is the cost of working with you to get us a Sweetlaw retainer, right? Because these aren't all equal in any stretch of the strictly with it, right? So yeah, I was like, there's no way there's no way they're signing them as part of a grander strategy They just don't know I I this, I know he's not going to have the answer, but they tell you their average value per retainer because I can guarantee it's lower than ours. And if it is, then that proves my point, but I think I can prove my point doing that analysis just as it's late.
00:32:18 - mark sweet
Yeah, it just makes sense. And again, if you've got larger firms, they're signing it, they've got capacity. It's the same reason we're referring up is they're getting signed up and getting referral fees. It's not a case, right? Yes. For me, it's a lot of work or lot of...
00:32:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It won't math out. It won't math out.
00:32:37 - mark sweet
Yeah. takes a lot more labor to get that out than one that contains a lot more issues.
00:32:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yep. And it will lower, it would probably lower your overall average on the real stuff because you're people are running around working on stuff.
00:32:51 - mark sweet
So it's going to bring down the whole thing. However, every now and then there's a diamond in the room, which is why it won't do anything.
00:32:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. But it's gotta be super rare.
00:33:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, that's kind of like, I don't know, it just seems like gambling math to me where because you have less control of it and it's not because it's not the norm because it's an outlier. And just thinking about, there's multiple things. Again, the SACO model has a much longer runway. So one of the things and the math activities we could should do would be to look at that. What does that runway look at? What are the variables? What, what does it look like to get there? So I like to reverse engineer. What does it look like when we're there? What's the difference here to there? What are the steps that would have to happen in order to. get there what's the nearest step take that step and it works better reverse engineering because you know what it it that's just the definition right so starting to do it the other way it gets really confusing and you can make some really bad choices but then when you look at so reverse engineer where you want to go come back what does it look like what are those steps what's just too big of a leap to take because it's too risky too much change too much volatility in the business obviously you want to step it down from whatever that is that you can mitigate risks along that path but the longer you play the game of i want to take as many as possible within the realm that you already have right that you won't take all garbage stuff so that you have the a greater opportunity to catch the big fish. You're playing two different games. You can't play both games at the same time. So at some point, one has to become the priority goal and one has to be sacrificed. And those decisions should be made mathematically. But we haven't even begun to outlive the, or lay out the framework for that equation. But since we're having this conversation now and we're looking at it, that's where we should be going late. that would be a whole calling itself just trying to start the math. Because of all the assets you have, all the people you have, all the sources that you're going, like, what does that look like for sweet law? Because there's, you're not going to have the same amount of staff. So anyway, it just depends on how much you you're interested in that. Whereas before, I think it was a no way in hell, am I doing that?
00:36:07 - mark sweet
And now it's a it's either that or so, or, you know, conclusion, the problem of the soccer model is, yeah, it's a it's a runway, but with a brick wall at the end of it.
00:36:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Right.
00:36:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
and everyone and a bunch of people get fired.
00:36:21 - mark sweet
Right. And who's going to work where the ship that's going down?
00:36:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Okay. But so here's the thing, we're having this conversation sounding like that's a potential. We need to block our energy off from anything that's not even a real opportunity. So if you're really not even actually consider going down that path, then we need to stop talking about it and stop putting any energy to it. If you really are considering it, then you need to ask yourself, are you really willing to take the actions that have to happen, taking the people.
00:37:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
into account in order to make that happen and if so on what time frame are you talking about it two years from now five years from now 10 years from now because all of that makes a big difference but whatever conversation we're having needs to be real needs to be what we're actually working towards or we need to stop talking about it yeah who's what someone talks about like you know you can't have a B right you work the A it's like don't have a B because that it's it's a distraction the B becomes a distraction because you're considering this thing that you're not going to really do and you it pulls focus from the A so if the A is really selling the firm in and then yes put a time frame on it but with or without a time frame you can certainly define hey this is like what I was saying for me it's like this is what it needs to look like in order for me to sell it and maybe the time frame is like It's going to take me three years to even get to that point, right? But that point can be defined now. And if that point is like, hey, no one's going to want to buy this firm because I know my overhead is too high, well, then that needs to be factored in, like, how do I reduce that overhead in three to five years or whatever the timeframe is? then, I mean, in a way, you have sort of this B, it's not even a B, it's like a fall back. The fall back would be like, oh, if I do all these things to sell it, in theory, I could fall back to this Salka thing because it would just be there. But it's not being factored in at all. It's just sort of this known backstop that's there, but it's because I focused on the A version of this. No, that's my- So start firing people is what I'm hearing Tina say.
00:38:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is not what I said.
00:39:00 - mark sweet
But I heard a whisper, it's going to be there, like, no matter what I do, that's always going to be an option.
00:39:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It is.
00:39:07 - mark sweet
Yep. And realistically, it's not even a plan. It's like, it's a fallback. It also has more value to my firm that let's me get larger lines of credit or whatever I need to do for growth or whatever.
00:39:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. But it's growth in the context of selling, right? So then what, I mean, I don't know when Jacobi sells, right? what is the metric here?
00:39:35 - mark sweet
Is the metric straight?
00:39:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's profit margin in bottom line?
00:39:39 - mark sweet
No, because they're a brand. They're in the name.
00:39:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I am not. Well, yeah, that's true.
00:39:44 - mark sweet
That's not the problem. is significantly different than theirs. My value is the value of my cases and nothing else. Okay. I mean, yes, there's some value to my systems. Yes, your value to my people. Yes, there's somebody in my processes. what I do is very rip it.
00:40:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Replicatable. Okay.
00:40:05 - mark sweet
Right. there's nothing special. Like if Tina's law office tomorrow could pull from the same sources.
00:40:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
If you haven't the same I had, you could do the exact same thing I do. Right. Totally. The only difference would be that they don't know the numbers yet. Right. That's your advantage right now is that you've gone through and figured it all out. And now you're like, okay, these are the numbers, these are the targets. That's why the dude in Arizona failed. Right. We know that without even without knowing anything. He thought, right, money, money gets cases done. And it's, we know, because I say it all the time, it's idea money, excuse me. So you started the, what's interesting about your scenario is that it wasn't necessarily your idea. You changed the idea. The idea was Steve's idea and Steve's idea was wrong. He, he had ideas. money. And he's like, idea money, and then he sort of had the execution that was you, right? I'm going to execute it. But the idea was wrong. The idea was that he could spend money to get cases. And that wasn't true. So then he left you holding the bag, and then you change the idea. You were like, okay, I'm going to find vendors to get, I'm going to figure out how to get a series of vendors to get cases. So it was similar idea. But his sort of just relied on throwing a bunch of money at it. And it didn't work. And that's what the dude in Arizona did. His idea was, hey, if we throw a bunch of money at it, it turns into retainers. It turns into money. Of course, the idea being that every retainers equal, like God only knows what their math was. God only knows what Steve's math was. But then Steve's new idea was, I'm going to go buy marks, essentially, right? I'm going to go buy sweet loss. And that's what he started doing. And I'm sure his math is still bad.
00:41:53 - mark sweet
But that was a better idea than that. He's extremely different than mine. His math is, I can absorb a higher cost for gay speaking. because I get more out of them than anyone else.
00:42:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:42:03 - mark sweet
He's making a ton of money, so clearly, if not worse, I don't understand how necessarily.
00:42:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But if you don't understand how, it doesn't really work.
00:42:14 - mark sweet
If you're sitting there questioning it, they don't reduce their fees ever for clients. I think they're outsourcing some item so they're payroll may be lower and just charting into the client.
00:42:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean, his math might not be all that great. By making this, he's getting $10 million settlement, or he doesn't refer it up.
00:42:40 - mark sweet
He keeps it lit again.
00:42:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Are they even going have to get that?
00:42:44 - mark sweet
They are. They've got some good litigators there. Now, now they've got some. And again, they've got a brand. So they've got people, you know, being the name forever, you call in. So their costs should go down or whatever. time, but he's buying.
00:43:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. They're sort of hybrid model at this point. They're doing, they're sort of working multi models, basically.
00:43:09 - mark sweet
I mean, realistically looking at all of this, what I probably should do is save up enough money to spend a year worth advertising on billboards in Washington state. Steve's not in Washington. Yeah, they don't know who he is. Or Illinois or Missouri, like a state he's not going to.
00:43:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I wonder what the alternative to billboards is, right? It's like, what's the bill? Is it like next door in Hulu? Like, what's what's the new billboard where like you're in everyone's face? Like, I see these commercials on Hulu. I've never seen a legal commercial on Hulu. But you're inundated with them now. And then it's like on next door. It's like, where what are the it's not Facebook.
00:43:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's like, what are the
00:44:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
equivalent of billboards.
00:44:01 - mark sweet
It's YouTube.
00:44:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, I ran a bunch of YouTube ads.
00:44:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What about TikTok?
00:44:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's like, you can't, I don't know. mean, how do you, if a billboard is someone on their commute, it's like, how do you inter interject yourself?
00:44:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would test basically a billboard ad on TikTok. Because here could be, well, I, but I think it's cheaper on TikTok, but I don't know. But I would test and I do like this theory because I do think that social media is the better billboard or TV spot type ads, the streaming ads, because if you don't need it, so you don't have to have a long spot. It just has to be short and frequent. And so that somebody who has been in a wreck or recently gets in a wreck is going to have seen that, and the frequency is the most. or important thing, and a memorable number or access point website, whatever, but it's one of those things you don't need it unless you need it, and you're not looking for it unless you need it. So frequency and location, which is why billboards work, people pass them back and forth on their commutes. It is effectively the same thing, but it should be cheaper, and the exposure should be better, and the tracking is way better, which means the opportunity to optimize is better. And unless you've been seeing it, most of your competitors probably aren't doing it. Most of them are more old school, playing the old school game, dominating those spaces. I think that there's a lot to be looked into. This is not my area of expertise in terms of where to get it, but we could find those people and try it, set the budget aside, but I do think that that would be much better than billboards is TV spots and social media spots, but very short, very clear, billboard-esque so that you're not spending for a lot of time, but it's just frequency and location, location being digitally in their faces frequently. Personally.
00:46:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean, it's like, what's the digital equivalent? If you think about a billboard, they're strictly like zip code base, right, and their routes, right, roads and zip codes, so it's like, hey, we're buying a billboard on this street in this zip code, right, and basically this lower income neighborhood is where they are, for the most part, right, or major, or in major, major thorough thoroughfarers, so it's like, what is the digital equivalent of that? I don't think you need to do that just like the bus. It's like buses, but that's what the if if you're gonna If you're gonna emulate that strategy You have to be like, okay I feel like this is the bus and or the banchan or the billboard like I think I'm just going through my head right now I see the whole day long here.
00:47:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I see like who are you talking to the those neighborhoods?
00:47:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like is that what you mean? Yeah, yeah, that's the targeting the targeting is where Where is the who is it touching, right?
00:47:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's like you drive by the billboard That's it and it's they picked that billboard for a reason so typically because it's Psychology behind it is Because you just made me think of something that we could discuss about this is first of all people of all Wealth ranges, I can't think of the word economic statuses Yeah, um, get in rex, but the bigger impact and the need to handle it strategically is with the impoverished people who like I can't afford to get health care I can't afford to get things fixed. Because a lot of times I mean you just make a call go to insurance people just like deal with it. I don't know. I don't know that that's true. That's an assumption, which I would be trying to get more data on if I'm trying to build the most optimized business. I would want to know what are the statistics of hiring a personal injury attorney across the income lines. What does that look like. Now, because here's the difference between billboard placement and doing it online is that placement has to work and it has to work for that demographic. And you don't want to waste eyeballs because of how much it costs whatever. Whereas when you're, when you're doing an online and casting a wider net, Mark can practice in all of these different states, and now he's, he's got less competition, because his competitors aren't in that same space, which is not the situation with the billboard ads. So understanding the frequency of hiring an attorney engaging an attorney, at least even exploring it with personal injury with an accident. And what is the competition presence in those spaces because those two are significant variables that billboards can't really change because they're physically located in one place. So, like, it isn't apples to apples, no matter how much we try to emulate it. I think it would be foolish to try to replicate it, I think taking the best practices, which is very The clear language, the visualization of it, the will get you help, you know, that type of thing, but things that we can do that billboards can't do a split test. We can track demographic engagement. You can't do that with billboards. you know, the angle that you're taking to me is a little bit like, I don't know. I think it's not tapping into the advantages that we have by doing it online.
00:50:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, when I've never seen someone do, and it's just my personal experience, it's like, what they do with billboards bus ads, whole thing, they're always hitting the vanity number. It's always the vanity number, right? So, what they're trying to slam home is this brand, this vanity number. So, you would emulate those aspects in an online ad, right? Whether it's a fixed image or it could be a video, right? But... it's really hammering home those two things so you would get a vanity number and then you dedicate it to your billboard scare quotes which is your online app and you would use and then you would rely on these these are how many people we've held from this how many millions of dollars we've gotten and settled or whatever no no the vanity number is like one eight eight five five five five five five five oh like they're all taken they all cost and seen amount of money but you have to have some that's yeah it might be easy to remember yeah you need a hooky something um like here it's i think the guy's number is all zeros or some maybe not that would be a terrible number we'll get you zero nine million um most different stories is 800 all sevens um Morgan and Morgan's got one that's the blades yeah yeah but that's what they do right so they're hammering home the brand and the number And it's literally just with the classic marketing of just repetition, right? They just keep repeating the same message over and over and over. They're just drilling it in people's heads. And then when the time comes, they're like, oh, I got in the car accident, I'm going to call 1-800-the-LAW, or whatever it is, and they do.
00:52:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What if you use also a QR code?
00:52:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They have to scan it. So the way that it works traditionally is that they're remembering the hook. So it's like, you need the hook. Yeah. Or either in the name or in the number.
00:52:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, does it have to be? So first of all, there's options. There's so many different phone services with different prefixes where I think potentially you could get that if, and maybe there's a person whose job literally is just to go get you the best member memorable that stands out.
00:53:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, or you have to figure out a hooky thing and then get the, you know, the decoded version of that, right? So you're as 1-800-COME 1-800-APPA and you're like, oh, it's available, but it won't be. It's like a domain name. It's like it's not going to be available. You have to pay a crap ton of money for it.
00:53:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or you just have to be a little bit creative in the way that you think of it, because like I can always find a domain that works really well that's available. It takes a lot of thinking about it and then you just have to brand that. But it's the thinking and it's always the thinking that does the winning because most people won't think that far and they won't think that hard, but that's the way you win this game.
00:53:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So, I mean, if you want to emulate that stuff, you have to come up with, that would be the works. And then, and get it. And then you'd copy that online and you could copy in all the ways that we just talked about, you could do it on the TikTok, right? Maybe you run these things in separate, distinct runs, right? But you have to run them for like, I mean, this is always trying to do the math in my head, right? So if you figure a billboard, someone goes by twice a day, right? So that's two impressions per person per day. So you'd be like, okay, I'm going to cap that aspect. I'm going to allow two impressions a day per person, because that's like a billboard. But same thing, they're going by maybe once or twice a day, any more than that's probably excessive. But then it's every day, because that's their commute. That's the way to the house. That's the store they stop every day when they're on their way home, whatever it is. So you would cap the impressions to two per day per person. And then what is that costing you? What does that cost on Hulu? What does that cost on TikTok? What does that cost on whatever? You could probably get kind of project that out. And it's like, okay, what you don't know is how long does that need to run until it turns into a phone call, a lead, or whatever, like that's the big question mark. then once you're committing to that, trying to figure that out, and then you would like a billboard, you would just leave it on in perpetuity. Hopefully you have tracking that can buy it back to TikTok or that becomes part of your intake. You get some of that, where'd you see us? But yeah, and it would likely be cheaper than a billboard, for sure.
00:55:41 - mark sweet
Well, people think billboards equal legitimacy.
00:55:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, I think it's the repetition is what it's because, I mean, it's the advertising, it's the repetition that them seeing over and over and
00:56:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the imagery so it's it's in his favorite thing it's what does name space she loved it he's ready to hire him what are you talking about when you saw the sweet chains girl boards that are trashed fella oh boy almost doesn't matter what's on there as long as it's that frequent and it looks like authority and there are so the colors you know the navy blue um gold uh there are different colors that have psychology behind them um there's a whole color rule of psychology but it's also going to be so if it looks like something they've seen um there's black backgrounds basically and navy blue backgrounds the majority of them that's what they have they're used to seeing people in suits and ties big language they're to seeing a scale of justice, that imagery, a big phone number, you know. So, people that are in metro areas are used to seeing billboards like that. People in rural areas who still can make you just as much money and are not seeing your competition as much, they don't see those billboards. So, they see at best an ad in the paper and it's not very good, or they see a card that somebody's handed them because they live in a small town where there are no billboards. And you want, you're going to be targeting those people, that's probably actually the majority of them. So, you have to take that into account too. But even still, suits and ties, the scale of justice, navy, black, professional corporate type stuff makes people feel like, oh, that's an attorney. That's not Billy Joe down on the street who's brother is practicing law and says he can help me out, that kind of thing. So anyway, but it's starting somewhere. First of all, finding people that know those channels and can advertise well on them. Getting, I think we could probably find somebody to help us get a good vanity number without having to spend our time on it.
00:58:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm looking right now.
00:58:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's horrible. then the other thing is to get a list of all the sources where you could get toll-free numbers. not 800, but a toll-free number and then find a few different phrases and basically we use chat2bt to give us a few different scenarios and then basically maybe take one of your assistants and systematically go through each of the toll-free providers with each of those phrases and see which ones possible. Eventually we get there. It's the great things, which is what we're aiming for doesn't come from little efforts and flukes. And you know, we just arrived there. It's strategy and it's systematically going from this step to this step to this step to this step. But and then, you know, there's innovation and disruption, which is where you're at right now, because your market is still primarily radio and billboards and maybe TV spots. There might be some people coming out of it, but we know enough to know that people buy from what they see on online ads and streaming ads and things like that. So it's not a huge risk. You can mitigate the risk by with the budget, but the likelihood and even probability that you could do better by putting some very strategic ads short, low level of exposure again with the math that that Dan was doing with the bill. boards, although I would probably want to double that if they see it two times a day. want to let them see it four times a day. If it's just a few cents per impression, I don't know.
01:00:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But I would just try to near what's real, right?
01:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you're like, okay, I'm trying to do define what's real though.
01:00:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like this is billboards. If you're commuting to work, well, you not pass it four times a day.
01:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Okay, but I'm saying we should not be trying to duplicate billboards because you can't and it's so much better. So we're using billboard type strategy and ads, basically essential of it and knowing that those are the big competitors. And then the rest of the emulation would be from other successful ads that people are running on streaming services that are working for them.
01:00:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But we don't have any data on other.
01:00:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can find data. Anyway, I'm sure we can find data like if this is what we want to look at and it's worth really looking into and looking at it. Well, we can put some meat on this framework and and plot a course that that has some numbers behind it. So we're not just, you know, going blind, but we would have to decide that's what we're going to do. Who's going to go get the data and look at that, because again, going back to you trying to optimize everything that we have based on our resources. The fact that payroll is excessive and marketing is excessive. The faster one to try to correct could be marketing because payroll is going to be a whole, if you cut that back, there's a morale issue. And I'm not saying you don't cut that back, but, you know, replacing attorneys becomes difficult, and I don't know. You know, maybe that ends up working if you lose one attorney and you said, basically everybody can do from everywhere. It's just somebody else has to, you know, look, they have to pair up with somebody who is Able to work in in that state. That's a possibility.
01:02:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So maybe you Yeah, that's that tricks on something. Thanks.
01:02:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I told you forget about this.
01:02:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What? So I have a buddy that is barred in DC. He's now barred in California. Here in California, he had a job working for I forget the name of the place, but it was like in the legal department and the head of the legal department was a lawyer. So he worked under that lawyer and like did all the contract work, right? he knew all that stuff, but he was never I'm gonna say I don't know what to call it the lawyer of record or whatever, but he literally did all the work and then that person's name was attached to it. So it's like, what is that version? That guy can't command the same level that an actual barred lawyer can command. But it's like, is that, is that even possible?
01:03:15 - mark sweet
There's some, yeah, there's a huge difference. If you're in-house counsel in a corporate firm, it doesn't matter as much for your license. If they have to go to a corporate proceeding, he has to just pro hop in. So if you're doing too often, it's a problem. But if you're working in-house, it's not. Okay.
01:03:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Very different. There's no version of that in your world.
01:03:38 - mark sweet
That's what we're doing now. They're just doing it under my name.
01:03:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, what really? So these guys don't need to be lawyers? Theoretically.
01:03:48 - mark sweet
Technically. Diego can run a case from start to finish. As long as I'm signing off on it, it doesn't matter.
01:03:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, that solves your payroll problem.
01:03:59 - mark sweet
No. It doesn't, because lawyers and case managers don't handle cases the same way, they're generally not as good, and they don't get as much money.
01:04:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, I would argue that becomes a process issue, right? Could that be solved the process? So, I mean, in the grand scheme of things, would be like, don't know how would you test that theory, not in your office, right? Where people are like, wait a minute, he's gotten non-lawyers working on cases, what the hell is going on? That's a lot.
01:04:32 - mark sweet
mean, it's like Daniel Kim. Are you serious? He's attorney in his entire office. 99% of work that's getting done is being done by people who are not lawyers. Oh, so that is a thing. She failed law school and she just was borrowing an old man's lawyer.
01:04:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is real. I didn't No way.
01:04:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So you could bring Kim Kardashian on the staff is what I'm hearing. This would do wonders for your marketing.
01:05:02 - mark sweet
Yes.
01:05:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, okay in-house.
01:05:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, let me go up in the lenses.
01:05:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's interesting. So you could have like, you, Mark, could take more cases in-house. know, everyone's on your name, but you could start taking more cases and then have like a sidekick that's not a lawyer, but you're like, this dude knows his or gal. They know their stuff, but they're not barred. So there's no threat of that person like going to another firm. So you could pay that more than like less than a Sam or whatever, more than the other, because you're like, I see that you're more than a case manager, right? So you went to law school, whatever, and then, and then teach them how to run a case the right way. And it's like, okay, and then, then that's it. Then they just know how to run the cases the right way, and then you just keep giving them cases. question is how are you-
01:06:00 - mark sweet
We found those people don't want to usually have some pretty large words, right? Otherwise, why are they not a lawyer? I still have all the liability here. So she's also got liability. I do have her supervising attorney, but her license on the line too.
01:06:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Right.
01:06:18 - mark sweet
Yeah, totally. So there's a different level of responsibility versus Diego, who I get a bar complaint or I get super malpractice, it just goes on as another job.
01:06:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, maybe then that maybe that's where, so maybe that's where an incentive package actually works in your favor. I don't know that the incentive actually works in your favor with the lawyers, right?
01:06:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because they can't skate, but this person's like, hey, oh, yeah, it does what Samantha you can, you can tell.
01:06:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Um, but so the grand scheme of things, there is a version of the world. There's a, there's a version of the where there are no attorneys on style. That's interesting. I didn't think that was really a thing.
01:07:05 - mark sweet
Oh, yeah. know there's a lot of those.
01:07:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I had no idea.
01:07:08 - mark sweet
I just didn't see plausible. product is usually garbage, but yeah.
01:07:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, this is where my checklist argument is like, if the process is so dialed, you can mitigate that.
01:07:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a whole lot of variables and that's a long-term play and potential like, for example, Mike, who comes in late every single day and takes long lunches and kind of looks like a slacker, maximizes distributions. And the only one that does better on the Rens' team is the Rens, but he doesn't like doing it and Mike doesn't have any problem with it. He likes those conversations. So distributions down the the reason that conversation is difficult is because that's when they're negotiating the attorney fees and sometimes the firm gets more money than the the victim that I don't know what you call it the client and and so they're like well why are you getting more money than us and there's a conversation and the attorneys get stressed out about it and they negotiate down and but but Mike has this ability to basically because he's not the attorney but so part of it is he uses the attorney as a scapegoat and is like well I don't I don't have that ability to do it the attorney because they've already made the decision this is how it's going to be and then just kind of placates the the client but they love it and they don't mind and so he's able to do well at that now can we find other people because that's a that's a leverage point right maximizing fees and being able to have the skill of negotiating that way Now, if there was one of those on each of the pods and they're the ones taking up the time and they're not draining the attorneys with that negotiation to the attorney's brains can be focusing on is the rest of this quality work to be all the eyes and cross all the T's. And this would go back to the book switch of not just finite willpower but the impact on willpower and cognition and the ability to even think well the more stuff we have to wrestle with a. In AKA negotiations, the less mental power we have to be able to look at the details and the nuances of the case well so there are a lot of levers that I didn't even know existed that in meeting with the attorneys now starting to come to light. Where I think having this conversation a year from now will be completely different, not that it has to wait a year from now, but I'm saying there's a lot of it and mark you are the mastermind behind everything but you're all. also an operator. And you are involved in operations, and even if the majority of it is networking, that's still a lot of mental function and power that you have to be applying to that. So to think that you would be just excellent at masterminding and looking at all the different ways to leverage and nuance, you know, that wouldn't be realistic that you would be great at everything all the time. Nobody is. So then it comes on us to have this together and to continue to work the system. But now we're considering different possibilities than we explored three years ago with different data, with actual data to kind of look at it. So I think that we keep the conversation going, but I think that we also consider looking at what are the lever points, so distributions for one that conversation, where are the other points where it has a significant impact on money, so intake, choosing, first of all, their scripts and just the way that they process calls and taking the best cases, not taking garbage ones or whatever. That's a lever point though. How intake handles negotiations for attorney fees is really significant. And then obviously just how the case gets worked up, that it's getting worked up in a timely manner, followed up and all of that stuff. But inside of each of those things is a skill or a set of skills and evaluating the skill set on each of your members of the team and kind of maybe either improving where they can be improved to bring up so that every pod has somebody who is greater distributions and hopefully it's not the attorney so that the attorney can be kind of the you know the hot guy that's looking at everything and making sure everything's going according to the way it should be and and optimized. So anyway we're already like 10 minutes over but I think that we're on a good path. I know that the numbers aren't ideal but the more the better we are at having these conversations and digging in and also just being able to work with the attorneys and if I can get in there with the intake team and we can find where the lever points are if we can improve the skill set on the existing team or figure out how to redistribute work and I don't know that that's possible. know that they work better in pods. I've got that from but if there is a way to redistribute across people so the attorneys of the ones that actually get the incentive pay. If some of that is somehow sifted down, I don't know. But anyway, that's the conversation. That's what we should be looking at to figure out how we get your payroll down. And then the other conversation about marketing so that we can also get your marketing cost down and just be working that system for the next several months to a year. We've been growing, I don't know, your profit margin hasn't been growing, but we've been learning so much, we get to a tipping point where all of those things coalesce to a much more optimized business with higher profit margins. I definitely think that we're on that track.
01:13:44 - mark sweet
Okay, I'll talk about the script essentially does.
01:13:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah. I read it. I'll send you my notes because I'm like, to me, it's not a script. Okay. But parts of it are like it's in there.
01:13:57 - mark sweet
It's weird. The presentation, was like, well, it's not really a script. But, uh, but it's way there.
01:14:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, it's that first minute dude. Like I don't know if you guys listen to calls, but it's just getting whether they should stay on the phone right up right after the cell mutation. Like there just needs to be like one question, which I think it's sort of there. And then it's like, to me it was, I'm used to reading it like in a script mode. I don't know. Like from like being on sales teams in a certain way, that was like an overview of like the strategy sort of that. Like so, but whatever I read it, I would just change like that one part. And then because it's, if they get into the other parts, great. It's really just like, should they still be on the phone? That was the thing that I just kept running into like, dude, you should not be on this call. You're like wasting your time.
01:14:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that gets into call control training. That's all. Call flow. Yeah. All All All All All All All So we can keep working on that too. All right. We okay bad it.
01:15:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
This 800 number stuff is for the birds.
01:15:17 - mark sweet
industry is clearly captured. We do have one half the one that we got produced this year. One eight hundred nine seven five two thousand. And not that difficult of a number to remember.
01:15:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's not bad.
01:15:31 - mark sweet
That's a ring. You're paying numbers or whatever. Those are going for high six figure to seven figure.
01:15:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's just going to work. How much do you pay for that?
01:15:40 - mark sweet
We have it. I don't remember how much.
01:15:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think we paid like a couple grand for it. Yeah. I think you can make that work. And again, it's repetition. So how many times does it get repeated? Like is it is it being said, it doesn't flash on the screen. It does a flash on the screen while it's being said. repeatedly those things stick in your head and so it's not just what you have but it's how you use it. That's workable.
01:16:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah and we can just mess around with it because it could it could be like you're sitting here like sometimes you just go boom there it is right so it's like you got this this one and then you might come up with one I'm like trying to do one around like oh I well the other thing is how adjacent is it to somebody else's so like if you ever typed a domain name wrong in or whatever like sweet lost sweet James like you can get into that oh yes it was strategic as you are if there's something closely adjacent to it that's a competitor then maybe that ends up actually creating more of an issue so something that's not related to a specific phrase but it's simple just an easy number to remember and you
01:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you make sure they remember it, then maybe that's actually better than potentially sending it to a competitor. Whereas if it's just a number off and it's, you know, Joe's burger shack, you're not worried about it because he's not going to take your business and they're going to keep trying to figure out who it was instead of go to your competitor.
01:17:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like 1-800-the-law 3, how about that Mark? sure that guy would love it if you did that.
01:17:30 - mark sweet
I'm sure I'm going to sued for that, yeah.
01:17:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like it's a totally different number, buddy. 3, 2, am I even saying? Yeah. The next number.
01:17:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I believe in...
01:17:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's like the price is right strategy of phone numbers.
01:17:47 - mark sweet
I've got one dollar about it. I mean, we do, um, like, sweetlaw.com instead of just sweetlaw.com.
01:17:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No.
01:17:58 - mark sweet
No, it was like you just in case someone... misspell sweetlaw.com.
01:18:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, right.
01:18:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:18:04 - mark sweet
We also sweet.law. Or whatever that's for it.
01:18:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, yeah.
01:18:14 - mark sweet
Okay. Sweet as you, IT portion is already taken.
01:18:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that what you have is, is easy enough. Like it really is. Think about all those ear rooms, those jingles, the friggin just repetition that stuff sticks in your head. It's, it's psychology. The human brain is not that complicated. So work with what we know works. Just it's the common seriously big text. It's flashing. Somebody's repeating that number over and over again. It gets in their head. They could be sleeping in the middle of the night and they're repeating that number and they don't know why. That's how the brain works.
01:18:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So,
01:19:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What?
01:19:01 - mark sweet
You're right. You're absolutely right.
01:19:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
doesn't matter how good or how about it. It's repetition.
01:19:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
01:19:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
if it's a little hooky, it's got to have a little like roll off the tongue.
01:19:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it does because so you've got two sets of zeros, 800, 975, It very much falls in that and it's unique enough. So the repetition, it will get in there subconsciously. I'm telling you. And then if you make sure that you also make the correlation to this is an injury attorney, personal injury, a law firm, know, then it's it's stuck there. It gets into the seps and that's why I'm talking about more than two times a day, that kind of repetition. But whatever, we should be split testing it and we'll be able to test way more than radio ads, billboards or anything else. But we haven't even started this. This is going to be somewhat like I'm talking about a year long path going down here, trying to figure it out. and do it right but I think that we bleed a lot less money doing this. I think we have way more leverage doing this but the first thing we have to do is stop being afraid of what's got to be this it's got to be that it just tapping into human psychology that's what makes marketing great doing it getting data real data not assumed data because somebody else is doing it getting real data and then adjusting our approach based on our real data that's what we should be doing.
01:20:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know how to think is like this is also like a 1980 strategy right this is based off of a phone number the letters on the phone like why would you even do that what is what is the new version of that what is the future version of that is it text settlement quote to 965 well that's the other thing I was thinking about is how do we engage a chatbot into these types of things.
01:21:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So that because these people was streaming ads, whatever, do they want, you know, an instant answer? Do they want to have to dial one number? Do they want to have to remember it? Can they remember at Sweet Law now or something like that, where we're somehow the Google search and it gets into a chatbot? I don't know, like, hit us up on Messenger here. And maybe that was on a Facebook ad, hit us up on Instagram messages. And it's on an Instagram map. It, like, TikTok messages, TikTok ads, kublu message, I don't know, maybe it's a phone number, whatever. But that, again, is all the nuance.
01:21:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But first we have to get a framework to get started as a QR code. For sure.
01:21:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so the thing is that here's the two things. So if they're streaming on their TV and they have a QR code on the TV, then you get it with your phone. If they're streaming on their phone and you have a QR code, then you have an issue because they can't scan it with the device. They're watching it, but can it be a clickable QR code with Hulu ads? I don't know, but that's a potential and if that's not available now, I guarantee you it will be down the road very soon because they want advertisers to stay with them and the more engagement they can create for their advertisers, the more money the advertisers will spend, so that's just down the road. So if we're planning for that, if we're positioned to be able to take advantage of those things because we're already on that path, all the more better for us. But either way, being where the people are, that's the whole point of white billboards work. So that is what we should be doing by online.
01:22:49 - mark sweet
Still think the boards still work, we should still be there.
01:22:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not saying they don't work, but you want an optimized leverage business and there's competition and dollars matter. So definitely. fine work. Does it get you clients? Yes. Does it get you in the profit margins you want to be? Bet you it doesn't.
01:23:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's really the time. The time is a totally unknown variable. Like, does it take a year? Does it take two years? Like, how long does it take? And how much the only way to plan that is?
01:23:21 - mark sweet
Yeah. It's going to take at least a year.
01:23:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
01:23:25 - mark sweet
So you got to stick this in for at least to get it.
01:23:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So but here's the thing Mark. Do you want to work? Do you want something that works? Or do you want something that works at maximum capacity? Optimal leveraged? I thought that was what we were working on.
01:23:44 - mark sweet
I'm interested though in how we build a brand that has more value to getting those. And unfortunately, purely digital does not carry the same way.
01:23:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that you're making assumptions based off of the world up until this point when the world is something changing and is almost new every year at this point.
01:24:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, and the other thing is that brand is, is free of analog or digital brand become brand is branded exists outside those things. And then they translate that brand into an online search, right? So are they brand is losing its power? Brand. But you can brand through both and then the brand is established. So the question is you can build brand through an oppression offline or online. So it's like you get to the same destination of brand.
01:24:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think brands now is as powerful as your reviews are because that's what people are relying on. Back in the day, it was all word of mouth. We knew what we heard about. And what we heard about was from our friends, whatever, and so that was the power. our branding. But now, everyone, not everyone, but a lot of people go to review sites. So you've already got that game locked down. If you do that, and also are in the location where they are, when they need it, I think that they, I don't know, that we've got to get some research to find out the power of branding. But everything that I've been watching for at least the last five years is suggesting that branding is much less important these days. Unless you're looking at the brand being their reputation online and their reviews.
01:25:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Now, deep in the vanity shortcuts. Like, how do you get one of these? I don't think I've ever seen a Or he's one of these either.
01:26:01 - mark sweet
Uh, Morgan and Morgan uses pound law.
01:26:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There you go.
01:26:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
what about pound, sweet love or sweet justice?
01:26:11 - mark sweet
love that one. People don't know how to spell on their phones very well. OK. more they try to spell a word, the more likely they are to screw it up because people just keep on them. Numbers now, they don't really, you know, see letters. That's much.
01:26:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, this is this would be text text my quote to 0, 0, 0, 0.
01:26:38 - mark sweet
Right.
01:26:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So they don't have to spell anything. They're spelling my quote in the SMS message and then the destination is 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, it all is.
01:26:50 - mark sweet
Yeah.
01:26:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Until I'm also going to look at the QR codes. This is not going to be far away where they're on a device. device or QR code where you can click that and all of that will be coded into the link that all they have to do is tap it and it opens up the text message or an app with a message that drafts it and all they have to do is click send and it's going with the right word and to the right number or address.
01:27:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's not following. I think do that with I think I could do that with leaf glory right now.
01:27:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's so and that's leverage that's what I'm talking about every friction point that you can remove like you guys are talking about these different games you know branding and it you don't you don't have to win the branding game you don't have to win the billboard game what you need is a certain amount of cases and at a certain value above and beyond what you're at without increasing your payroll costs. That's all you need. We're overcomplicating it but trying to worry about what the competitors are doing. Leverage the technology. That's available to us now. Keep your eyes on your own path, because we have enough data to know that we can do better if we apply it and stop thinking about everybody else.
01:28:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm going to go ahead my haircut. Thanks everyone.
01:28:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll be thinking about this a lot, trust me. I would like some Ronin pictures, please, if you have them. I do.
01:28:32 - mark sweet
I need happy pictures. He looks like a stuffed animal.
01:28:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want it. Oh boy. Bye, Dan. Bye Mark. All right. Later.

You're so quiet, but yeah, definitely. Are you there?
00:00:11 - mark sweet
Yeah.
00:00:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you?
00:00:14 - mark sweet
We're good.
00:00:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You sure? Why are you so quiet?
00:00:21 - mark sweet
I'm always quiet. Most annoying thing. the way up.
00:00:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're not always the same kind of quiet, though. You have nuance to your dynamics.
00:00:38 - mark sweet
Yeah. Interesting New York Times article. Well. Uber is trying to put on the ballot in Nevada. It's easy to have that happening. To cap attorneys fees at 20%.
00:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What?
00:00:58 - mark sweet
Because they're getting sued left, right in the center for. having their drivers aggressive or people. so their solution, instead of, you know, doing better, is let's make it harder for people to bring lawsuits. Because originally they were forcing everyone to arbitration, but then there was so much backlash they stopped that. Yeah.
00:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are the odds, do you think, of that passing?
00:01:26 - mark sweet
Um, not small. It's a short answer. Because they have people telling others that during, I think, 80% of the fee, and so this will stop them from taking more. And yeah, I don't think it's very hard to put together a campaign ad saying, stop pretty attorneys from taking all your money.
00:01:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so two things, and only one of them really matters, I guess, for you. Well, okay, so these are the two questions that pop in my mind. One, how can a law firm stay in business with that and two, then how do people get any help from attorneys if there are no law firms who can afford to do business with them?
00:02:19 - mark sweet
Well, first, this would only be for work. What it means is there's by going to be excess costs. like, okay, this fee is just for the attorney's time, not for the paralegals or whatever, and they charge separately to try to make us a difference. Yeah. It's just going to get, I don't want to say shadier, but more complicated.
00:02:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:02:48 - mark sweet
So, I mean, there's always a workaround. The question is going to be what is it? Uh, institutional arguments, I think as well. know, how can you actually cap this? But federal law does have a cap on the attorney's fees, so it's not like it doesn't happen.
00:03:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and there's precedent, but what is the federal cap?
00:03:09 - mark sweet
I think it's 25%.
00:03:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then how do you get 40% attorney fees? If there's a federal cap.
00:03:19 - mark sweet
That's only on federal cases.
00:03:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay.
00:03:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, only on federal cases.
00:03:29 - mark sweet
So the only other states that have a cap. Really or equal one has it at like 50% one has it at a third. But yeah, we can go up from that. So we'll see what happens.
00:03:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, how let's see. We don't even have any Nevada cases this month yet. Okay. Off the top of my head can't think about how many cases we get in Nevada.
00:03:58 - mark sweet
We don't really have any Nevada cases.
00:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, that's new. It was one of the newer ones. Okay.
00:04:05 - mark sweet
Um, Will it immediately have a direct impact on our business? The answer is no. Just, you know, future proof. The Nevada firms will then continue to look to expand other states like Arizona and Washington and potentially California. So there's kind of the back and forth. So that's just what it means. Um, so move the Midwest is still better for us to try to build out.
00:04:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, yeah, and probably in a lot of different industries because the Midwest just, I mean, the Midwest is like the Old West. It's just, it's like, or the Wild West, it's still, I don't know, it's like it's America 100 years ago, almost in some ways.
00:04:57 - mark sweet
Yeah. So, I mean, this is at least two years off. Okay.
00:05:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:05:03 - mark sweet
And then I, I guess.
00:05:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dan, the, the thing was that Nevada is trying to pass some law that caps attorney fees at 20%.
00:05:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Time to start Arizona firm. Let's go.
00:05:20 - mark sweet
Well, why are everybody just came up because the Arizona was serious about it, but there's an even more out of state firms coming in, which they're already pretty pissed off about.
00:05:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean. Well, and that's why, I mean, whatever the industry is, it doesn't matter what it is. The, the way to, it's not, I don't believe in future proofing, but, but trying to, but is, is to have the leanest business and the most optimized business possible. Whatever those systems are, whatever those. processes are, and I mean, the attorneys need to be thinking about that for themselves. You need to be thinking about that. Nobody knows what the timeline is, but whatever the most optimal process is, if you're not thinking about that constantly, which you are, but that's the thing. There will be some other companies that will be doing that and other ones will die, but the pace of change, first of all, is fast, second of all, it's getting faster. So continuing to look at what we can optimize, what we can systematize, how we can better use our resources is just going to be the thing. And then how we can duplicate across locations like we're already working on. So what is the, I have to go back. I know I have notes, but Utah, what's the situation with Utah update?
00:07:00 - mark sweet
Brad left the law firm that he was with and joined some new law firm so we're still signing cases I just got to make sure we have the new routine of the new law firm but in the cases he had with the previous law firm it still is so what Dan we haven't talked about litify reports what's his name is like on vacation for a while what are the latest updates on reports do you know yeah now he did this calls thing for me based off of what I brought up like two weeks ago about like I'm trying to figure out like I don't know what I'm trying to figure out trying to figure out if there's some sort of really
00:08:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
relationship between call volume, can we look at call volume over time? that opposite time? Does it say the same? And then how does call volume, if any way relate to retainers matters, right? So he busted out this report, I think he sent it over on Thursday on Friday. So Stacey, well Stacey has been, so must have been Friday. So she's like, Hey, you got to look at that, get back to Josh, but I've not looked at him. And I don't, I don't know what I'm looking for. It's more like the date is there. Is there are there gaps? I don't know. And or that it could be nothing, right? Just because the way that intake works. I think there'll be some relationship between call volume probably, but I don't know. But all the other reports that you wanted, all those are done. So all are they right?
00:08:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know. Yeah, that was the thing about that.
00:09:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
and last time and um no he picks those so it's like now we have to review the updates okay so what's your new report called uh i don't even know if it's a report it's um some call thing it's probably not it might be a dashboard but i don't know how he did it or it didn't lit up by so it's probably it's either a reporter a but i don't i'm medical ubering right now i'm going to pick up my patient it's another lovely money of me driving average call to convert source to state type there we go that's it um so what's funny is he did i was like i want to know this and then he was like oh you want to you should look at it like this i was like yeah sure you do that we'll see if that i wouldn't even know
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like, okay. Automobile.
00:10:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think there might be nothing. That's the whole thing. I don't know that there's going to be a damn thing.
00:10:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I will let you look at that then. Can you look at that before I call next week?
00:10:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:10:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:10:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm stuck on this 20% thing now.
00:10:20 - mark sweet
So, it's like, yeah.
00:10:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
no one will adapt, right? Is what I think. Most will not adapt. So, they will, they will die. So, they're not even going to, they may not even know it's happening. But I'm sitting here thinking, okay, if you run the math on 20%, like you're out of business right now, pretty much.
00:10:51 - mark sweet
Right. Like, that would be lower or gross by about 60%.
00:10:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, like, do you plan to try to game out an inevitable future? Or do you try to like, what would it look like to exist in that world? And I legitimately keep thinking about an Arizona firm. isn't that the real future? And yeah, those, because I met with they were floored that I know you guys are going to find this hard to believe. So a lot of these law firms don't know their numbers. Like, you're kidding.
00:11:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Really?
00:11:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So like, they don't have an average retainer value. So he's like, where did you guys get that from? I'm like, a calculator? Uh, not that hard. Hey, but, and they were, they were cool about it. So they just have cli plans over and over and over again that don't get the value of what they're bringing because they don't have any internal math whatsoever. So they're in the same sort of hamster be alive was on. When I had that business, it was like, you'd go back to them six months, theirs is short of period of time, ours was literally six months. And six months down the road, they'd be like, oh, didn't work. And I'd be like, uh, so you didn't sign or I would have the leads. I would start reading the leads to the, I go, so we say to this guy in a motorcycle, oh, yeah, signed that guy, yep, but it didn't work. No, I signed him. Okay. So it did work. Yeah. guess so. Oh, boy. And they're all just lawyers that I'm a lawyer. Yeah. I know. I'm well aware of what you are. So they, you know, they've got some pretty big firms like doing a lot of leads. And they get good conversion rates, but my argument to them is like they might not be making money because as we pointed out several weeks ago, they're signing everything. So they don't know what's what at the end of the day. And then if they don't track it through the end, they don't. So at the end of the call, the guy goes, all right, so if I ask you a question, go, yeah, if you were us and you had a legal agenda business, what would you do? And I said, I wouldn't have a legal agenda business. And he's like, what do you mean? And I said, I would go, I would start in Arizona from I would get involved with someone that could start in Arizona. And they knew what that was, but they were like, how, how do you do that? I said, well, I'll tell you how you don't do it. You don't go get a bunch of private equity and think you just put money in one end and money comes up the other. Because that's, you need to know all these things that we just talked about. And as you. No, that's hard to come by, right? There aren't firms like that. But to me, the model's real. It's just no one's done it, right? No one's actually, they don't know the math of, hey, this is the acceptable cost per retainer and this is the whatever. It's, you know, it's my my whole idea of money execution thing, right? those guys, the idea is right. They, you can't execute it, but and you, you do need money. But if you have money in the idea, which is all these people you guys have, it failed miserably because they didn't know how to execute. Now, whether and they probably didn't know how to execute from an intake perspective and they probably didn't know how to execute from knowing the math of what works, what's not, they thought they could just throw a bunch of money at it, get retainers, and ooh, money. Anybody thinks that at first? but it's like, Part of me is like maybe that maybe that is the play is to work or maybe you And I'm thinking of this right now. like maybe you go start an Arizona firm. That's not sweet love And you go hey, gonna go build I'm gonna go build this other thing on the side that doesn't that's the optimized right genius word the optimized version of this so There are no loic. There's a lawyer Right, there's no there's a parent. There's a parent. There's a pot and you go can I can I get you know How many Arizona leads are there right now? It's like if I could get Four or five Arizona retainers a month you can gain that out you can map that out into the future And see what that looks like and what does that? I mean, I guess you could just do that right now You don't need to do the thing because you know you have all the math and say hey this is what that would look like this is what the profit margin on that would be and then how do you throw that so it's almost like you build this parallel track if it makes sense mathematically and then that's probably a pretty future proof model in a world where every state goes to 20 percent or whatever like you don't even care so i'm like that and then just use that spurtly can you have more than one law firm for an attorney that's what i thought there was some kind of limitation technically no technically right well litigiously
00:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, would it be even a conversation risk wise to have?
00:17:12 - mark sweet
So it's not as simple as just open up a firm in Arizona.
00:17:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Yeah.
00:17:27 - mark sweet
There's more that goes on.
00:17:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But you know, I'm like, let's just gain that out. What does that even look like? What is the profitable is that for. Right. Or that, that idea. nothing great. needs to be a firm.
00:17:42 - mark sweet
Why would it be more or less profitable than what we're currently doing.
00:17:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Because you have close to no overhead.
00:17:54 - mark sweet
What?
00:17:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You knew it's better being in the case. I know, but it's just a spreadsheet, like what does that spreadsheet look like and if you can like build a model around the thing, what and it's real, so I'm just curious like what does that actually look like it's it's just like when it came up here in the that we're wrong, it's eventually going to come fight us in the because the model of literally selling a single or, you know, two products, whatever, like we average two products per person, you know, per car or whatever. And we were selling 20 a day and I was like, okay, the problem with that model was, well, if one day, 10 people show up. But I just made half the revenue and that happened. I would have it all the time. So then when I modeled it out as a subscription, I was like, OK, if I get the same amount of customers a day, the business triples is what I figured out. And I was able to create that spreadsheet because I had all the other data, I just had to map it to a different model. And when I did that, and literally I struggled for years, I just couldn't see how to do it. I was like, I don't know how we do it. I thought I was trying to build it in parallel, and I couldn't because I couldn't get enough data, and it just, it wasn't real. And then I stumbled upon how to do it when we were these jerks were trying to require us, and I had to do a bunch of math, and then all of a sudden I was like, oh wait, there it is. And then when I mapped it out, I saw, OK, I could do this for 90 days, we're in the exact same cash position we were trying to do. higher, except tomorrow, I'm going to make 10,000 guaranteed. And the day after that, I'm going to make 10,000 guaranteed because now I'm on a subscription. So that's what led me down that path. And then consequently, I didn't really see how much it would increase the overall gross business, but it did, like I said, it tripled. So here, it's like, Oh, wait, we have all the math. So let's build the spreadsheet. What does it, what does it actually look like? And then you can say, Oh, maybe that's maybe that's something that should be pursued. And then you then you get into the, well, you'd have to do this, you'd have to do that. But the it's real, the spreadsheet would be real. The math is real. It's what it's what the PE guys were missing. They probably didn't even have the other, but we have both pieces. It's just we have all the data. It's just not in a model. And it's like, whether or not you do it is a different story. But to know what it looks like, I think it could be would be interesting.
00:21:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, I just had a thought that I've never had before because of what you just said, which is, and I don't know if this is possible or probable, but probably worth at least the conversation, rather than, or at least, okay, anyway, all these different thoughts at the same time. But what is the possibility and or even just ability to create a separate entity, and a separate business model that is not sweet law, but that you own mark that is almost like a science experiment of the most optimized level so that you could, without disrupting and having to move all of this to modify and alter this giant organization compared to something very small with maybe just one attorney so that it's not you, not because you actually need an attorney, but one attorney that out to scale with multiple assistance and case managers across multiple states where we figure out the thing that we've been talking about which is basically an attorney less type model with much less expensive people working for you, one attorney so that it's not you, one that you're and it could be one that's already existing and I haven't thought all of this through but basically what if we build the model that we're talking about, aside from sweet law, very very small and see if it can be optimized and then scaled like we are talking about and take it out of theory and into practice and see what what could be done.
00:23:08 - mark sweet
So walk me through this a little bit more. Obviously, I'm certainly whatever else. They're now going to be court owners of a law firm.
00:23:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So that's- No, no, no, no. Not that one. No. No, I was just, they just were like, what would you do? I was like, I would do this. This is more about taking the the vendor model to give this vendor model and you're plugging it into, let's call it a traditional pre-lit firm. And now you're like, well, what if I plug that into a different model? Same concept. I'm going to go take vendors, but I'm going to run them into this Arizona firm that's using a model that is, like Tina said, this attorney list or this optimized firm. This idealized thing that, what is that? I look like, right? So it's like, how do you do it? And part of it is there are on staff. There is no Sam Tyler, blah, blah, blah, blah, right? So there's a pod maybe, or there's an optimized pod. And then you go, OK, this thing is getting this thing is signing five cases a month. And then you game it out, all right? Well, then in nine months based on the average on the average retainer amount, blah, blah, falling in $40,000 a month or whatever in month nine. And then it's kind of recurring, right? If all the numbers stay the same. So then it's like 40, 40, 40, But what is the actual profit margin on that? And I mean, we can literally do this in a spreadsheet.
00:24:51 - mark sweet
It could. So we're just making a parallel firm has its own intake, its own accounting, its own legal team.
00:25:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, we're not actually doing that. We're mapping it out so that you could so that we can look at that and go Hey this things Got 40% profit mark like whatever. I don't know what it's gonna say exactly, but And maybe and maybe like maybe you don't do it. Maybe you go Maybe you invest in it or we get you know what mean? It's like it's not necessarily I don't know what the outcome of it is but to know the model It's definitely what the PE guys were missing and it's like maybe that's the right like okay So if it's a law firm that can have non-lawyer partners you have that But what if one of the partners was a lawyer but wasn't a lawyer at the firm right? Can you be mark sweet that owns a piece of another law firm and not be a lawyer in that law firm? don't know Baby to it, but you're still gonna have all the liability and everything else.
00:25:57 - mark sweet
I'm sure right But why is this any different than say taking a case building out a pod that is in Corona or whatever else they're giving 50 plus fees back two-thirds of you back whatever it is.
00:26:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well because you could get other people's money right so you don't have to fund it so then you can go get I'll just say Omar you go to Omar and go hey I got this thing do you want to invest in it and then and you're not coming out of pocket at all and then it becomes like this sort of a revenue thing I mean it could be bigger than that right once it's mapped out then you're like you're building this asset you could start a new brand yada yada yada but really it should be way more profitable but it's almost like I was on this call this morning and it's we're going through this idea of buying catalogs of the music catalogs of these independent artists that are dormant and And part of the math, like the example, when we were using the catalog makes $8,000 a month right now. Well, that's with no promotion. So I can buy the, we could buy the catalog and then it's $4,000 a month to basically pay the financing. And then, and then, so I was like, all right, so you get four grand a month. And then the other four grand, I'm like, well, what if we just pump that into promotion to grow the asset of the catalog. So it doesn't make any money. And it just becomes this recurring thing of we're going to just invest in the asset over time. Because in year five, the assets going to start paying out more. And then we don't have to promote it anymore. So you could do something like that where you're building this machine that's like a self perpetuating machine. Like, I don't know exactly what it would look like, but I would like to know, I mean, dude, I can. do the spreadsheet. have all the data.
00:28:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I might just make it. And you do that by next week?
00:28:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Probably. I would like to see, I would like see what it looks like. Because then it could just, it could be an investment vehicle. It could be this like annuity that you build around using the knowledge and basically the knowledge that you've acquired.
00:28:23 - mark sweet
But how is it any different than me just doing our intakes? I know what's coming through, you're placing a certain firms in the field is bad.
00:28:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you expand on that? Because you said that before in the 50 like. So first of all, I don't think it has to be a separate entity. But the biggest thing is that your model of what you're paying your attorneys is what's choking you the most. And that you probably don't have to like you could, I don't know if you could use assistance for or paralegals for most of the work, but that's part of the conversation that's been had. So if it was somebody else, they would not be, it would be almost like they don't even have any connection to the rest of the sweet law. They don't operate the same. They don't have the same kind of commission structure. So it doesn't necessarily have to be a separate entity. basically, some very different type of operation is what needs to happen because it's the model that you have right now that is not optimized. Nice. Hello.
00:29:42 - mark sweet
Yeah.
00:29:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You did.
00:29:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was my I'm always like, you're sick. there was a female voice that it was definitely not damn hard.
00:30:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. No. Soft and twist.
00:30:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So I love it. I love it.
00:30:08 - mark sweet
love it. Getting outside money. Well, I don't want see is like not a problem, but that's generally not the main issue. Plus, again, new partners, expectations, dynamics become a lot harder, right? Yes. Getting loans or lines of credit are easier, although obviously more stressful.
00:30:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I don't even think that's necessary. we're going to go minimum viable option, the simplest thing is create the model instead of, okay, so we've been talking about working towards building a more simplified model because we already have this big entity that exists the way it is. And there are multiple iterations and modifications in order to get that and vision. What I'm saying is, let's just create a new entity. It's not necessarily separate physical from sweetball. thought as a company. But it is in terms of the way that it operates, like it's an entity within an entity, with a completely different, you know, what do you call it? My brain at the moment is not working.
00:31:20 - mark sweet
No, we're saying just having intake the intake and referring out for the highest fees back possible from these other lawsuits, so you don't deal with the headache of actually running cases. And you just cherry pick the absolute best of the best, the best slam dunk.
00:31:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I'm not saying don't do that, but I'm saying that wasn't what I was talking about. I was talking about almost the same thing that you're doing now. But first of all, an attorney that is not getting the same payment structure, because that is part of what's hurting you. And then in a sorry, like I'm in an extreme amount of pain right now, my brain is not working really well, so I need both of you to help pull it back to conversations that we've had before. But to the point of like Salko has talked about what you could do, I don't think it's not having cases and I but more of who's working the cases and working them up and how it's getting done because I think the bigger issue is your compensation plan that you're paying attorneys that mostly don't have to do anything like understanding that also part of their function is being a liability buffer because paralegals in case assistance don't have any liability. Therefore, they're not incentivized to be extra cautious to make sure that they're not doing anything that's going to get you sued whereas an attorney is because they have liability. So anyway, but I'm looking at what is the most optimal or a two, maybe two variations of the most optimal type of model that we could build, that we're not able to build in sweet-law because we've got existing expectations and compensation models. Anyway, do you guys get what I'm saying?
00:33:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I do, but now I'm thinking, wait a second, we can actually, like, Lorenz is the only person that works in Arizona, right?
00:33:29 - mark sweet
Hey.
00:33:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh my god, there's some other.
00:33:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, so.
00:33:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
so now I'm thinking, thanks the new guy. You can, you could have, we can build two models, right? You basically have an Arizona firm right now for lack of a better price, right? You take all the money and that's going into Arizona now, that's operating as a current pre-lit firm, and then you con trust that against what if what if those things didn't exist and you would strip away Hank and Lorenz and yeah then you look at the marketing expense that's going there so yeah we can actually do this right now I'm super curious to see what that looks like because it should be a way higher profit margin entity or idea whatever you want to call so you're technically correct as it looks right now because like all of intake was under California payroll in California right yeah but we peel them out and say we know intake 600 bucks a retainer we already did that map so you just yeah but we did your map and it came out to a yours was slightly higher it was like six six forty or six twenty or something and then you we have the leak cost we have the average retainer we have all the things it's just and then we can put in It's like a left verse of this versus that. So it's like traditional pre-lit versus this other idea. And right, like you said, it's not that it needs money. That's just part of the formula, idea, money, execution, right? Sometimes it doesn't need any money at all. And it's more about like, you're talking about, it's really an exercise in what happens if this was executed differently. With the idea of like, hey, there's a future where fees could go down to 20%, right? And you could factor that and go, okay, now let's switch, let's switch, we know right now, if you switch the formula, you'd lose 16%, whatever you just said. You could then switch that formula in the thing ago. This is what it would look like. went to, it all went to 20%.
00:35:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One more thing to think about that, in light of that. And again, I'm gonna tell you right now. mentally diminished capacity. But is there an opportunity? So going down to 20% fees in Nevada, if that happened, and obviously it would take some time, and by the time that we get there, it may be a moot point if we already have a more optimized model where we don't want to think about this. But you may be in the position of investing and being able to do this by the time that rolls around. Let's say small firms just die off, but they are maybe operating in some of the smaller communities, and they've got word of mouth, and they've got, you know, all these lead sources coming in, but they just can't operate like that anymore. Somebody's going to try to buy them out. Could you do that preemptively? Could you, and rather than actually buy them out, can you, I don't know, like just buy their leads, be like, look, this is coming. When we get there, anyway, this is this is a very premature conversation to have.
00:36:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But because it's happening with Salka right now. I literally just thought that the same thing. the thing that I was talking about earlier with the catalog, when I talked to those guys, so right now there's a catalog for sale. It's 250 grand. I did the math. It's worth way more than that. It came up with this formula based on the streaming, just the streaming revenue. They want 250 grand, so I was like, we should go back to them with an owner finance deal, and they were like, what's that? So this 50 grand down, 6%, you get paid off in three years, we have the ability to balloon payment whenever we want with no penalty. So yes, you could then, part of this could be looking at these older guy firms, and you go in and you own or finance the acquisition of their firms, but really what you're buying is their referrals, right? That's kind of what Steve is doing. It's Salka's weirdly, sort of inheriting these firms. I don't quite understand how it's happening, but you could do something like that. And again, then you're just getting retainers into this optimized entity. you have no money going up for those retainers other than the acquisition, which is a fixed monthly cost of whatever it is. And then you can go value that firm with your data and go, because they're not going to have it. What's your average retainer value? I don't know exactly. But here's the average retainer value in Arizona because I've already had hundreds of cases here. So this is the value of your firm.
00:38:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know why I always laugh at that. Because it's a sad truth, yeah. Every time. Hi. What are you thinking, Mark?
00:38:58 - mark sweet
It makes sense. It's complicated, but makes sense. months.
00:39:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's definitely different.
00:39:05 - mark sweet
You're just going to be with the cost pre-acquisition, you know, at the end of period, no matter what, whether it's a 20 percent fee, a 30 percent fee, a 5 percent fee, right? Yeah. It has to make some sense. The smaller firms may actually end up better off because a lot of their stuff is just bored of mouth referrals. So they don't have a marketing cost.
00:39:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No.
00:39:27 - mark sweet
So they may actually be the one that better off and say, you know, Ronnie, Sweet James, whatever else the board does, because they're marketing machines.
00:39:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Their margins are susceptible.
00:39:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. sure.
00:39:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, I think that's the next so are yours, right? like you are that to a degree.
00:39:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think the best way to have this conversation is with a map, with we can plug something. thing in of this is what we know, right? And this is, and then do some projections if the margins were this, if the costs were that, you know, this is what the output would be. And then talk about logistics of what would it cost to operate this? What is that, you know, the range high low in terms of expenses, margins, things like that. So that we, what's that? I'm talking to my Anyway, just to visualize and kind of wrap our heads around it, but also to figuratively and literally actually be on the same page, having the same kind of vision as to what it could be. Because I think that that is back to minimum buyable product options, whatever. And knowing that the longevity of being in this business requires. being optimized, and also knowing that if you were to modify your compensation plan, you're going to upset people, but they may not have anywhere else better to go, so there's that. But regardless, it will affect morale, it will affect productivity, so that's not really a super viable option. Then what is viable though is building a parallel business that was born optimized based off of your pre-existing information knowledge experience, all of that, and then build that out, and then you can either maintain them both parallel because we've optimized enough that it doesn't take a lot of your personal bandwidth mark, or eventually the existing model of sweet-law kind of fizzles out, dies out while the optimized model grows, gets legs and becomes what you wanted the original thing to be. I think that so much much of their, there is the, you know, I built this house, I have to live in this house. Not a, this house can be a rental property, I'm buying another house kind of thing, which is where I go.
00:42:14 - mark sweet
Can we talk about something completely separate and different? you. You know, we're in a small break, but any dance help with this?
00:42:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:42:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Go.
00:42:26 - mark sweet
So yeah, Chona took a job with Dr. E, so she's going to be doing kind of regular hospital stuff and clinic work, but she's also going be doing personal injury stuff.
00:42:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay.
00:42:39 - mark sweet
So this is where it gets interested. I can't send her into my cases because there's a conflict. So when she goes with other doctors and lawyers, lawyers, lawyers are really bad on the tech front. The only industry I think that may be worse is medical. By far, so government or government. Now, this may be a really cool chance to try that money dot com CRM that I know Dan's been talking about a lot because they do have a HIPAA compliant CRM. The only issue with everything is going to be HIPAA compliance. There's no zapier that's HIPAA compliant, but there's a like knockoff that is. So what I need to figure out how we can build is like a Monday dot com. can do scheduling with VAs that can take the basics of a patient, know, age, height, all that stuff. Sets up a telemed appointment. Telemed is probably going to be zoomed hip up. 15 minute console notes get pulled together mostly from a tent with the information the VA has gathered. They put all the other doctor reviews it before sending it over to the attorney with the appropriate bill. If we can actually make this work, it would be something very easy to sell to multiple practices that do personal injury because there's not lot out there that is very good. Okay, but I feel like there's some you might put something about that.
00:44:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
A bunch of high level is HIPAA. Okay, there's a bunch of people that do use it for HIPAA related businesses. So scheduling, I'll be done there, right? So they integrate with Google Workspace, which I think I'm not sure if that's HIPAA, you could definitely do the scheduling. Yes, you could use Zoom.
00:44:54 - mark sweet
We'd have to find out if Zoom is HIPAA, probably is. There is a Zoom HIPAA that is charged more for it.
00:44:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. And then what else, what else do you have to, so you schedule the appointment.
00:45:07 - mark sweet
So they also need to do some sort of reports and bills and traffic of all this.
00:45:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You can definitely do invoicing from within it. That's no problem. Then, you know, if there's. It would depend on what the reports are, right? So I just recently started creating my own apps that you like you basically I frame inside of high level. So as an example, for the thing that I'm working on with the music studio guys, we built this Spotify app that. It creates this sort of magic link that if a user clicks on the link, it launches Spotify and it's like, hey, follow me on Spotify. But then it also. kicks in their Spotify account, the album you choose, the singles you choose, the playlist that you choose, no, no other app does that. But it looks like it's just part of, it's called fan flowy. It just looks like it's built into fan flowy, but fan flowy is really just a white label of high level, like leave. So, yeah, if I understand, if we map out all the requirements, then I can go down a list and go check, check, check, check, check, and then you can determine if there's a custom app that needs to be made or not. And, yeah, it definitely sounds possible.
00:46:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, there's, so needs is relative, needs because the function doesn't exist or needs because, because there's another opportunity where you are right now mark in building that. So there's something called SkyFlow, which uses OpenAI and different LMSs, LLMs, learning language models. Anyway, to make that data HIPAA compliant, and then there's one called Bastion GPT that is HIPAA compliant GPT service. But if there is, like so Dan's got Norio, if you have somebody who understands the code, if you understand what would make an API call to OpenAI HIPAA compliant, there's got to be some things, right, that it basically maybe has to reside on certain servers, has to have certain security protocols. And also, in terms of the communication being bidirectionals, so, omnid, what's the one direction? Anyway, so that data doesn't get fed back into. So open AI, so you can pull information from open AI, but it doesn't process outside of the secure server, so it stays compliant. Anyway, if you built that, then you would own the software service, that would be another revenue stream that you could have. we're on the precipice now, where even if somebody has it, nobody owns the market. That market is, it's a blue ocean right now. But in terms of having the assets to create something really well for that, just our understanding of it, Dan has a great coder that could do it.
00:48:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There's a lot of people. Who is the end user? not a doctor.
00:48:42 - mark sweet
Like what is the end user's mix, right? So like a certain type of doc, like that part, I'm not sure. Yeah, let's go through stuff by step, because it's the problem. So, lawyer is usually sending over a patient.
00:48:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
do a lawyer or another doctor?
00:49:00 - mark sweet
Yeah. we're patient to, which is you've Dr. E for lack of better term.
00:49:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:49:04 - mark sweet
Before that patient sees Dr. E, someone's got to call and get some basic information. Right. Uh, name, height, weight, date of birth, all that kind of stuff.
00:49:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:49:17 - mark sweet
From there, if there's a personal injury component of it, the doctor's office is going to confirm, generally speaking, with the law firm that one, there's a sign lead, meaning the doctor's going to get paid, uh, to probably making sure the case is good. If you were a higher level doctor, not a chiropractor and scheduling that patient for a certain time. From there, you need to get the lean sign by both the patient and the doctor. Then you schedule the time to come in. Generally, if it's pain management, the first appointment, you can do a telehealth. You don't have to actually physically see them, or you can see them physically. doesn't really matter. If want scheduling, you want reminders, if it's to a location, you know, hey, here's where the address is, right, they can just click it and put it into their map really simply. Before the patient actually sees the doctor, it would be better that someone or a system, either a VA or a system, has those basics, this is what the person's complained about, this is their demographics, then they see the doctor, doctor takes all their complaints, reviews the records, and makes a recommendation, physical therapy, MRI, injections, whatever it may be, that's a report, that report and those bills would then be sent to the lawyer's office. All right, then you obviously have to keep some track of your AR, right, because that's what you're doing, so it would be cool to be able to see all the, let's see, cases you have with, so you're large, whoever it is, that gets paid, you're good on it. side. That way you can track how much you're getting paid by each lawyer's way, frankly. How much are they dropping? How much is making sense? Does this work?
00:51:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So that's, and so you're, yeah, and you're, what do they use nothing now? Or it's just some non-system paper and this and that or whatever.
00:51:21 - mark sweet
You use the electric, I definitely dealt with some paper. There's electrical medical record, but you know, the amount of personal injury they do right now is like less than 5% of their total business. The vast majority of what they do is health insurance. Yeah. know, you know, health insurance and what we do are not aligned in any way, shape or form.
00:51:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, right.
00:51:46 - mark sweet
So that's why I almost don't care what they currently have because I can almost guarantee whatever we're gonna put together is going to be a thousand times better.
00:51:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And they would use it just for these. They would be like, oh, this is just for our PI work.
00:52:02 - mark sweet
But of course, as in everything, once we're gets out that, Hey, this is good. Everyone's gonna want it. Because it needs to work with the back end stuff. the biggest pain in the .
00:52:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. And then we're talking how many different it's pain management and chiropractors or it's just pain management. Is it multiple types of doctors?
00:52:25 - mark sweet
So for what we're talking or just a handful, he's just a pain management doctor that you some procedures as well.
00:52:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But he's just a pain management.
00:52:33 - mark sweet
But if this works, could it go down streaming to chiropractors? Yes, chiropractors are usually kind of the last month of the cheapest people. Like they don't have a lot of money, pain docs, neurology surgeons will want this because they don't like dealing with the back end and right now they're just hiring people or hiring VAs to handle it, which comes with those issues.
00:52:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then it would be like Dr. E or whatever, it is working with sweet law and and and or it's like not not 20 firms but probably more than one or one to five or whatever I would guess where do we have far more real yeah wow okay just think of the you I can't sit on my volume to one doctor because it looks funky it looks bad sure sure where the client lives that may not actually be an option yeah three from the doctor you're not going to asking with one more firm and Chona is now inside one of these places she will be starting September 1st okay I mean that's where it's super helpful is to from me specifically to like get someone that's like in the thing and then show me the saying but I mean I'm listening to you right now and I'm literally building it going oh okay yeah all right yeah I can think I don't think it would do it like this complicated but you're gonna be no it's literally just knowing what needs to be known, right? you rattled off these things. I was like, okay. And in my head, I'm like, okay, I know that's built in. We were just the thing about high level is like, it's, it's like a sort of, there's, it's sort of like an erector set. And you, you, there's all these things you got to use them, but you have to understand what you're building, right? You have to sort of have the blueprint and then go, oh, yeah, yeah, all these, all these pieces are in the box. I just got to do it like this. And then eventually it could be a, that piece doesn't exist. Now I'm going to go build it outside and bring it in. So far, nothing, I mean, and obviously we're not too deep in it, but so far, I'm like, yeah, this is all in the box. I don't see.
00:54:47 - mark sweet
All stuff that's off the shelf.
00:54:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
really. Yeah. And then you've just build, you build these custom automations and custom, whatever, you just, you just, we just have to put together the blueprint and then go, okay, now let's build that. And then the like SMS you don't we don't build that that's there But you write the SMS this and you write the automations and you set the schedules on that so right? Okay, yeah, I mean it definitely sounds plausible And then Yeah, you'd go after pain meds first so because then you'd have that you have the idea of you would build They called it snap, but basically it's like you build this whole File we'll call it that it's the pain management file. So you go. Okay. got a new pain management firm loop launch the file boom the whole thing's built and then they just they just fill in their name their address stuff like that and then you you Assasify it and you're charging whatever right you I mean We have pretty good idea of the value of it. So it's probably a high dollar sass.
00:56:01 - mark sweet
And you could also theoretically buy their paper.
00:56:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:56:07 - mark sweet
So you've got two different avenues where you can make a lot of money off of them.
00:56:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but I'm building it in somebody else's house, and you don't own the software. So that's you know, no, yeah, did. So do you.
00:56:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, no, that that's the beautify level. There apparently there have been people that have exited their high level businesses for very large sums of money.
00:56:35 - mark sweet
mean, look at point.
00:56:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's ridiculous. It's built in sales force. Yeah.
00:56:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's they're using the same model like there's they make money selling white labels. And then it's up to the white labeler. I think the problem with high level. I actually just went over this with someone the other day. The people that are making money with it right now are selling the drill. of you could build an agency. In my view, the people that are going to make money with it for real, are the people that build things like this, the litifies of high level, where they turn it into a service for a certain target market, and then they go occupy that market, and then that recurring revenue multiple is real. doesn't matter. Yeah, if you built a couple of custom things, that's going to make it look better. But really, if you want to sell that business, they're just buying the cash flow. And the cash flow is real. the cash flow is built on your brand that was built on top of this software, but you went in and customized it for pay management doctors. Nobody else did that. And then you went and scooped up 10% of that market at $9.97 a month, and it's like, okay, yeah, we'll pay you. And then your stick rate is three years or whatever it is, that's what people buy it on. that's eight acts in your own.
00:57:58 - mark sweet
And look, we know doctors, they're Not innovative whatever they have they rest it with no They are not innovative at all so It seems to line up very well kind of what we've talked about and again I don't know what we're gonna learn from doing it for a doctor or some good things.
00:58:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're gonna learn for our own stuff But right yeah, I can see Dan taking an hour to build this first me taking two weeks It's not that fast, but here's here's the other benefit of doing that I think that you're all see if we if we were to build that The way that you could optimize sweet lot even more because I think that you would have a perspective shift That would be It's just one of those experiential things like when we first really saw the data like you thought you had a concept of what the data Looked like and what your numbers were and then we extracted and actually had that and that was like wow I didn't realize things were that whatever. I think it would be the same type of experience where your perspective would shift so much about what you think is possible versus what you know is possible because you saw something like that in action.
00:59:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well that's like I was just thinking how you know we're looking at this 20% fee thing or whatever but and it's like oh thinking three years out well if you think about the call two weeks ago we arrived at this place that was three years out from hey man you need more vendors or this could go sideways and now three years out you set a record and that vendor went sideways and it didn't matter yeah I was like that's that is great I was like I love that I was like that is so awesome so now it's like hey is it crazy to look three years out is it crazy to consider this 20% thing no no crazy not to no yeah it is you do the exercise it's like okay and maybe maybe it means nothing and maybe you learn something and but I'm Other people aren't going to do it at all, and then that's their folly.
01:00:05 - mark sweet
Yeah, no, I agree with you. Look, in the worst, the worst case, we just built something else to make money. It's not a terrible situation.
01:00:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, and there's not a maybe you'll learn something.
01:00:15 - mark sweet
You're guaranteed to learn something.
01:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. haven't done a single exercise. You haven't gone. Wow. Yeah.
01:00:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, you always learn something even from the failures.
01:00:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. And you're just paying money for that knowledge.
01:00:28 - mark sweet
But this is the right doctor to do it because he's he's a good doctor. I don't think he's the best doctor in the world. He's a good doctor, but he's a very, very, very smart business. So someone will get it and then, you know, it's on the people.
01:00:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So yeah, that's super important.
01:00:44 - mark sweet
Yeah, yeah, because most doctors are going to say no, or I like my paper files.
01:00:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
01:00:55 - mark sweet
Yes, but OK, cool. But I want to bring that up before I forgot about it because it's going to take a little bit. it's together, but like Tina said, I think it's going to actually take dividends over what we do and could help us with some of our own, you know, climb follow up and whatever else we're going learn from.
01:01:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, speaking of that, I mean, I've built some crazy, the stuff we're doing for the bands and the, like, I've built some crazy stuff on high level now. And it's like, Oh, okay, I get it. So I'm like, Oh, yeah, I can see how to build.
01:01:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, my last note is speaking of doctors and technology. I just showed Fuji how he could like save a huge pin in his butt with chat TBT and he's super excited about something that he hated. So it's good. Evolution and technology is our friends.
01:01:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Is he a chiropractor?
01:01:44 - mark sweet
No, he's pain doctor. So, Oh, he is. Well, right.
01:01:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He's the, he's the other guinea pig.
01:01:53 - mark sweet
By the way, you know, he does not know about each one of those new jobs. So not that you would ever let anything prop.
01:01:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Nope. Yep. Okay.
01:02:04 - mark sweet
Yeah. So again, if we can make this work, I'm very sure who would you be someone who would be extremely interested in using it?
01:02:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, totally.
01:02:14 - mark sweet
It just makes sense. Um, although I know they're more sales force based.
01:02:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:02:20 - mark sweet
Yeah. level of crossing would be to the extent of what just happened is, hey, there's something good, but that was very generic and I didn't talk about what it was. So if that's okay, if that's not, I'll just never say Mark or Fuji to either one of you. No, you can say more. been trying to build out systems that help doctors be less stupid. Um, and this is what we've done. And I think you would very much understand that.
01:02:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yeah. I'm very, um, very shallow in any references to other people always.
01:02:53 - mark sweet
But yeah, wait for Dan to make more money and need to have less of it.
01:02:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm all for it. Everybody. Yeah. And also to have fun though, that's what's important, we get excited like our brains light up with this type of stuff, that's something to pay attention to, it's not just about making more money, it is about how we're doing it, it's the fun, it's the down loves puzzles, I love puzzles and cool people, so all of that, I think we're all in alignment with that type of thing, but we can't ever lose sight of that.
01:03:22 - mark sweet
So originally with Twilio, which is HIPAA compliant, and Zoom, which is HIPAA compliant.
01:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and it won't be far behind that other things get there very quickly, that's the other thing to pay attention to, is how fast the pace is, and that the pace is continually increasing exponentially, so what's not possible now is, and that we think is maybe five years or ten years away is like a year or two away at this point.
01:03:58 - mark sweet
Oh, and also the whole physical therapy people. They're asking me questions of how can I do their stuff that are considered in a lot of VA's and running their heads into the program.
01:04:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What you could do is write up what those things are. I did take some notes with Bathum that I could try to get dance for you to kind of plug in, Dan. But whatever you're looking for, the specifics mark, having that in a document, email, whatever.
01:04:25 - mark sweet
You would say what Bathum pulls and then I'll just add to it.
01:04:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sure. I will do that as soon as we get off the call.
01:04:31 - mark sweet
Cool.
01:04:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Everybody have a good day.
01:04:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Have a good week. Word. Get me the Google ID mark. Do it. rip it off his head. I will do my math. Okay.

Hello.
00:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hello. Kind of quiet.
00:00:18 - Seth Ellsworth
Almost be my hair pods.
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're nice and loud now. Okay. Well, I am struggling with energy. I'm super allergic to where I live. And yesterday I had an asthma attack. I wasn't sure I was going to survive. And I'm just kind of sleeping. Yeah, it was pretty scary. But also I've been through stuff like that. But anyway, my brain is just not, well, I don't know, my energy, I think my brain is fine. I just, and I feel tired. So hopefully it'll pick up. I've done all the things. It either will or I won't. But yeah, just letting you know how to time if you're like, what's up?
00:01:21 - Seth Ellsworth
I'm sorry. No worries.
00:01:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm used to it. Just got to let people know because my energy swings so much because of health. That sometimes people are like, what, like, is it me? Did I do something? So I just got to let them know at a time that I'm like, no, I'm fine. Everything's fine. It just feels different. Not me.
00:01:51 - Seth Ellsworth
Awesome. Yep. Okay.
00:01:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm excited for this. excited to see what you've been doing. I think if we can screen share. I've been praying for it every day for you and also for them so that we know that we can be inspired for them to help us them accomplish their mission and know how to package and put things together. So yeah, anyway, I'll be quiet. Thank you.
00:02:20 - Seth Ellsworth
Same. So we're thriving on the same level there. So can you see the workflow? I'm sharing. Okay, let me point out a couple of things here. They just did this event last week. Okay, they reinvent your self-summit and over five days they traditional summit style where replace available for a while. If you join our $39 month thing, you get all the replays, plus all 80 of my meditations or hypnosis audios.
00:03:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much of that for?
00:03:16 - Seth Ellsworth
They sell those on their shop. How much of these on the summit for? It was free.
00:03:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay.
00:03:27 - Seth Ellsworth
I think they had a VIP level. And they only got like 30 people in there. Oh, I have no idea how many people they got in there.
00:03:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I thought you said okay.
00:03:40 - Seth Ellsworth
I was like, wow, they had a VIP level. And this is because this this thing right here, I'm going to highlight it in yellow. This is their seems to be their new focus is building this community. This is this is on Um, mighty networks, okay, $39 per month. And I imagine, you know, that's, this could be a play that, and John mentioned this on our first call, it's called grow and transform. Um, getting more people into this would be freaking child's play with a proper email. Um, So this could be the guts of what we suggest for them as a focus. Um, So, so that's, that's, that's a potential direction. Now, just to give you a picture of, of their business model, they kind of have two paths or two buckets. And these are absolutely not clear on their website either. Uh, because there's a lot of confusing crime. crossover. But they have the RTT therapy and personal development. And here they give away some regifts. Here's the landing pages to get a therapy partner. So so Marissa does not do therapy calls. She has a team of therapists that are trained. And people book calls just like they would from any therapists. So there's that. This, if I had to guess, is a small percentage of their revenue. Because they're therapists, we don't know because they haven't asked those questions per se, the career, the career path where they become a therapist and are allowed to offer RTT to their, to their clients. That's the 15. This is the $15,000 high ticket thing. think this is probably 95% of their revenue.
00:06:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It based off of experience with other people and smaller models where they do a thing or they teach people or certify them how to do the thing.
00:06:20 - Seth Ellsworth
That's always the case. It's the teaching and certifying, yeah. Right, so this certification, and they do have a certification course, I'm sorry, they have a course and a certification, but it seems to me like they drive most of the traffic to the book a call stuff. So let's see, book a up here. So there's that. We have, they have events. They do these all over the place. They have events for both tracks. One, the track for people that want to experience their own breakthrough and the track for people that want to be practitioners and then they have events as part of their fulfillment. So there's marketing events and then there's fulfillment, fulfillment events. This is, this, their conversion is probably really, really high with this. don't do a lot of marketing events. And I'm sure that that expands a lot of resources and time and they're getting older. So I'm. An educated guess would be they don't want to do more events.
00:07:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:07:43 - Seth Ellsworth
So an evergreen thing that runs that sells this $39 a month deal to where they don't have to do this is the first time they ever did the reinvent yourself summit that's a brand new thing. I have no idea how it produced. And a lot, I watched probably 10 of those sessions released the replay and most of them were recorded previously, which is a big undertaking, but now they have an asset that they can use. just, my opinion would be, this is incongruent with RTT because it's a bunch of random value that is not going deeper with their unique ability. So Marissa showed up and she did, she was, I think on three of the days, she was the first segment where she led them through a meditation or a sorry, I keep calling a meditation hypnosis, which great, but to me, they're running somebody else's playbook here. which is incongruent with this offer. So what we would do for them, essentially, this would be what I would look at, is I would go to their, let me share a second. I'm sure my browser. Here's a re-event yourself summit. Lander. They had some ballers in here. Jim Wick. John Asiraf, James Altucher, Pace Morvey's huge. He's a $600 million guy. But he's real estate. And then, anyway, this is a very, very random sampling, which I think is good five years ago. I don't think summits convert very well. And I could be wrong, but if I had to guess, I would say this didn't exceed their expectations. Here are landing pages. This is a landing page for free gift that is for somebody who doesn't know what path they want to go on. Here are an example of four gifts that they give away for free. So you click on this and you fill out your name, for each of these. So potentially, we could take one experience from this bucket. This is the this is the heal your self personal development bucket. This is the I am enough meditation. She has a book called I am enough. This could be a big one because that could also support the book. So my questions to them would be which of these produce the most revenue. And then we would take this automation or sorry this hypnosis and automate a four or five day email based experience for this. And also do the same thing for their free gifts. Let me see where that was the free gift. Okay, here's the opt in for the training courses, which is essentially just a prospectus that or a guide that it can opt in for. But we can take either their prospectus or their guide and then turn that into an experience that's delivered over time so that people can determine if being a therapist is right for them. So that being said, that right now they're pulling, based on our previous conversation, they're pulling a lot of their therapists from those who go through the personal development track and they say, hey, this would be really fun to make money with. And so there's a bridge that goes from the personal development track to the certified therapist track. And that is, is this right for me? My, my sister-in-law is a, she's a fangirl of Marissa. to like hardcore fan girl. This is almost all she can talk about. It's wild. And she's the kind of know it all girl that, you know, she has a solution to everything that yells you. And she's been considering this, but she's still on the fence. So it's an interesting ecosystem. They have, here's their book of call, which is literally just a book of call. this apply now just goes to their certificate or their $4,500 course for their, they call it certification. So is only $4,500 and they have a $15,000 like business in a box version of that. based on what I understand. Anyway, here is the shop just to get a real quick overview. They sell bundles of hypnosis audios. And each one of these kind of has its own little bucket. It is very unclear which of these does the best other than best seller bundle. And then here they categorize these based on the buckets that they serve love and relationship, health, overcoming addictions, personal development, wealth and success, weight management. And these trainings are our courses. So there's also these other foundation certificate for hypnotherapy. um, foundation certificate for rapid transformational therapy, I guess you can get started for 240 bucks. Um, confident coach, certificate and applied and this is the one videos. They have trainings and then they have a certification and then a business and a box $15,000 thing. Uh, sold via phone call and live events, most likely. And also have a couple of webinars. I didn't mention that. Um, I don't really want to touch a webinar, but, uh, they have one. So it seems to me like the, the better questions would be which one makes them the most money. Um, is $39 a month, their current focus, if it is, why don't we turn their current assets into an automated evergreen experience that upsells people into the $39 month thing at a very, very high rate. At $39 a month, based on their current price points of their hypnosis audios and people going through the hypnosis, conversion rates gonna be really, really good. I wouldn't be shocked to have 15, 20, 30% in terms of immersion. So, this to me would be, I think we can be reasonable in our... communication of expectations. But to me, this would be a home run. I can't imagine not hitting a home run with this. This is right in my house.
00:17:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's so you have to keep in mind what their goal is is to break the $20 million ceiling. And that's really difficult to do with the low ticket offer. So there's more to it than that. So here's some questions that I have. And I'm going to give you a stop your screen sharing I'll share from in a just a basic little thing. And just share some questions with you. But I'm going to show them to you so that you can visualize it as my share. So these are the things that we want to know because there's several different things. And I broke this down. What's the right down at your revenue? But percentage of your revenue comes from each offer. You can see the power in understanding that, right? How much of it from? But we need to know from everything, even if it's only 2% comes from weight loss. need to know all of it. Chances are pretty good that they won't know off the top of their heads how much they might have a guess. And so the next question is, what effort is applied to each offer, meaning what ads, landing pages, just follow up sequence, what did they focus on? We need to ask these questions and also get a read on their answers. So you can ask them ahead of time on the call. But I'll get to this in a second. Do you have any Google or any other kind of analytics? We will need access to that. What things are you wanting to do less of and why? For example, Brian wants to do, Brian Kurtz wants to do less events. He's hitting an age. And that's why, because he's just, he's tired. And so it wouldn't surprise me if this is something that they want to do less of also. What do you want to do more of, and why? I would imagine they want to do more of a scalable thing, because they're getting older. we don't want to leave the question. We want them to answer, and we want them to answer honestly. And why we're going to find the gold and the magic is where what they have gets optimized with and overlay what they want, where they want to go. So let's say that the primary, and this will be the biggest issue, and the biggest hurdle, if the primary source of their revenue is live events where they sell people into becoming a therapist and becoming certified. that's what they want to do less than. That's a problem. Now, there are a couple ways to look at this. So it's a problem meaning that's the thing that's already working and they want to do less on it. What you don't know is what the onus is that they're putting on you. Is it Seth, I saw your thing that you do and I want that or is it that I need to break a 20 million dollar a year ceiling. They seem like the same goal to them probably, but they're two separate things because you're not necessarily saying that that's the thing that we can do, especially if when they think that in their mind, they're thinking he can get us to do that without us doing the thing that we're already doing. But it's much more difficult. Let's say they're selling that for 10,000. or $15,000 or $20,000 or whatever, and they want to cut that source off, and now, like, how many sales do you have to make at $39 a month to recover one $20,000 sale? It's ridiculous, right? how much traffic exists right now? Do you even have the potential to be able to do that? So then, here's the thing, what they may be able to do is transfer what they've been doing at events to a lesser degree through your email automation sequence, so partly the selling and the transition from, I've been taking it, now I want to do it. Or I took a career path and I was doing this thing, and now I want to do this thing. So figuring out, whatever their highest revenue thing is and figuring out how to make that experiential. So let's say that their biggest source of revenue and audience and fan base is their events and it's because they what people tend to pay most for is two things results and access. Access doesn't have to have results. Access is I get to say I met so and so I get to say I get to take a picture with someone so people will do that because they think it makes them look big better so people will pay big money even if they get no results out of it just to go see these people so that's something right. But the other thing is results so there's there's another play where you don't necessarily get access but you can say I went through the same thing that John asked or after it or Jim quick or whatever, or you can see you learn from them because they're your mentors because you took a masterclass with them, that type of thing. It's the psychology and the angle behind all of it. the other thing is how much does it cost then to put on those events? Well, if they're paying for those speakers and chances are pretty good that they're paying money for their speakers because of who they have on them. Generally those level of speakers you're paying for them because they're not doing it for free. It's part of their job. They get paid to speak like Marissa gets paid to speak. So how much money does it cost them to put on their events and then how many times are they doing events? Actually, let's go look at and what's the conversion rate and what's the the revenue. So Let's see, these are physical events, three in April, two in May, two in June, nothing in July and August, one in September. So that's a lot of events and that's a lot of traveling. And let's say that whatever, like you could put a price on how much the event costs, how much time it takes to do and how much set up. And then you've got a conversion right on top of that and how many people actually get into it. So what if, and you can only put so many people into event because of cost, because of travel, because of location. But what if the events could be either their virtual or something else where they're not having to actually spend as much money or as much time organizing it and it's maybe It's an evergreen thing, and maybe they can't because it's not as experiential can't charge as much, but maybe they can get two or three as many people in there, and the conversion rate might be less, or the price is less, but because they can get more people into it because it's less cost prohibitive, and because it's not location prohibitive and all these other things, and then your, so let's say it's a two-day event, three-day event, let's see, these are four-day events, that's crazy, that's a one-day event, that's a four-day event, that's a one-day event, that's four-day event, so they have one-on-four-day events. Let's say for the four-day event, you know, you break it across three weeks, like event, it's immersive, and it's super... accountable, right? It's like, did you show up for this? Did you do this thing? Did you show up to the thing? Did you do this thing all the way through? And so there's a potential that they could replace their events or even, you know, let's say they replaced half their events at their age. That's a big deal. If they only did, you know, event at a quarter and so they could charge more money for it because they're doing it less, then it's a lot less stress to them, a lot less effort, less cost, but they can charge higher prices and get maybe more premium level people because they're still offering this, they're just doing it in a different way. I think that that's an angle that you could bring. I think also, if they don't have a CMO, like, that actually does a really good job, that is talking to them about scaling and other opportunities and leveraging. I think that that is kind of, yeah, who is it though? How good are they doing? Because they feel stuck and they're not leveraging their email list. all the things that you said, you're seeing them all dropping them off.
00:27:17 - Seth Ellsworth
a Dobson.
00:27:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and how long has she been with them?
00:27:26 - Seth Ellsworth
I'm not sure.
00:27:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you know, if I'm a CMO, I'm not letting my people not do their email stuff and not be managing all of these things. So, you know, there's an angle of, do you want some more help? let's just like call yourself something. are you a scaling expert? you a retention expert? You're the completion. experts, but you have more gifts to bring to the table and a team who has other gifts to bring to the table and a $100,000 offer that you want to make. So I'm just telling, I'm just trying to help you figure out like what are some of the things that you could do and also learn from this in terms of like what people need. Generally, getting to this eight-figure business level, I can't even tell you, I've got one, my eight-figure attorney, how much is just left on the table and it's just, it's a slow walk, but it's a steady walk upwards, way less time working, way more money, and we don't have to change a lot. eight-figure people for the most part get it and you need them to get the help, they go get the help, like it's a whole different ball game than bottom seven figure people, like low seven figure people, which is what, you know, most, I can barely make six figures, even wrap their hands around, I think seven figures is great, but on a business level, low seven figure people are a lot of times just still struggling. Just, they got there by dumb luck a lot of times, or just by hustle and grit. Now, to get to eight figures, you have to have learned some things. A lot of that can still be hustled and grit. Like, it's really hard for people who aren't operating in the space to have any idea what it actually looks like. But, you know, showing up at events, there's a particular look they have, conversations they have, like, you just know that it's charisma, personality, obviously the psychology behind it, what they know, NLP, things like that. They know how to persuade people to do things. He also can teach and give real skills. It doesn't mean that they're great at business and optimizing things. And they know that, which is a key opportunity for you because you do understand conversions and conversion rates and how to combine. And also, I mean, it's just perfect because they understand the psychology behind it too. And you can ask them, you know, are you applying everything that you know about psychology to your email sequences? Answer is no, 100% the answer is no, right? So how much more powerful would your stuff be if you walked the walk, right? So you just show them the things that are left on the table. So going back to this, what percentage of, what do you call it? What's the breakdown of your revenue? What do you wanna do more of? What do you wanna do less of? That's gonna be really huge. And then where's the money coming from? from, and how do we leverage existing assets, traffic, et cetera, to break the $20 million dollar ceiling? And so, what have they been doing? Have they, even having to do more just to keep hitting the $20 million, they probably have, right?
00:31:53 - Seth Ellsworth
Because they're suffering just like most people.
00:31:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, right, exactly. how would it feel Also, is it what is the ultimate financial goal, retiring, selling, because we want to understand, you know, what it's going back to what are they want to talk to you about, like, says, stay in your lane, just build us an email sequence. So we've got to be really clear on that. do you want me to just talk about how I can build you an email sequence and off to the biases, or would you like to really go into kind of a business audit and an opportunity on it for. What, what I see that you could be doing and. you know, there's that. So that's a conversation. These conversations, these questions, you could ask ahead of time, maybe fill that out, pray about it, and we can meet again on Thursday if you do end up talking to them at all, or Friday, go in and start asking questions. But at the end, have a pitch to make because, and also, is it increasing wood, increasing margins, even if top line dropped a little bit, but bottom line room. is our goal. Especially if it's scaling. and lower barrier to entry. So it means it should continue to be scalable and growing like the, you know, $39 a month offer. Because what I think that the offer is, is that we do two things. We figure out how to experience, like email experience if I. What we're doing in their events. And then also. Apply the same treatment to whatever their other top two top three offers are. So that's a lot of work that's ongoing. But. Most of the work is in analyzing their data. Which. we can do together. Chris is actually also very good at that. The automations, so we're definitely going to want what's his face, but we can also probably go hire other people. And I can help you with that and we can do that on the call together and just go look for people together. And then I have a whole process for hiring and testing people. We can do that together too because we're going to want more people than that. If we're creating this offer and doing it more. And then Chris would be writing the copy which he'll be paid for.
00:35:40 - Seth Ellsworth
We might have to find somebody else besides Matthew because he's tapped out.
00:35:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can find other people. promise that there are other people who are amazing at automations and they're just quietly working for other people because they're not. They don't want to run a business. I just want to get paid doing their thing. My experience with hiring people this year compared to even just three years ago, night and day difference, I'm shocked at what they know because the world has just changed that much, especially since COVID, in understanding online business. So the resources are massively increased. So I'm not worried about that, we shouldn't be. With Copy, if Chris can't do it, we've got a whole bunch of people to tap and we can tap through him or, again, we can go out and hire. whatever has to be built, the biggest thing is that we need to have the money for it in the sale. So it needs to be, this should for sure be $100,000, not 75, and with a potential growth. So let's say that $100,000 covers the email. experience of their live events, plus one other thing that leads up to the selling the live events. So it's like a breakthrough challenge. Obviously, that's right, right. And if it's not, then we plug in the things that are. So either way, what I'm saying is that we do something that is akin to building them a breakthrough challenge and T three, right? So it's the small thing that leads to the big thing and it's all an email sequence. And the goal is to do that in a quarter, but you have to build it and then you have to, and that may take longer than three months, depending on how long it takes them to get us all of their material. And you need just tell them that, you know, like, if you could hand everything over to us the same week that we close the deal, then, you know, 90 days we could do this. But the odds are that most people take a while to hand everything over, and it takes a few weeks, takes about four weeks, a lot of time to get all the stuff. So they'll send you stuff, and then you'll say, I see a gap, and then you ask for it, you send a request, and then it takes them a few days, and then they send it back. So there's this whole process. The first 30 days is really just a transfer of access to things that we need. Then you have to create the framework and say, this is what I think it should be, and go back to them and say, do you agree with that? That's another roughly about three weeks, and then you start to build it roughly about six weeks. So that's where we're at with the 90 days, and... And then, so is it like, once we get all the everything that we need is 90 days from there? No. Or 90 days total, factoring in, it could take up to a month to get everything we need. Yes. And if it takes longer than that, then it pushes our timeline out. And we're talking 90 days from the first iteration for the first iteration. So then it has to actually be sold and we put people through it. And then we have to see how it's doing and watch it. So that's another 90 days, because it takes time to get that feedback going. It takes time to see if something's stopping them and then we tweak it. So really, we're looking at a six month runway to make sure that we build, launch, and optimize the first level. of whatever it is that we built. So the six month thing allows some fluidity between the 90 days, you know, it doesn't have to be exactly 90 days that we launched it. The bottom line is after six months, you've got something and we've optimized it and by now you should be getting your money back if what we're doing is applying the email treatment to the thing that makes them the most money. So but they don't have sales copy for that. So they do for a live event but it's an angle. So there's a lot to be built. So the hundred thousand dollars is we're building this giant thing that replaces what you're already doing and it's scalable but also we're building the feeder into it. we'll be building the copy for it. We're going to, we're not going to just give it to you and say, look, we're going to give it to you and watch it with you. We're going to give it to you and make sure that it's working. Whatever is not working, we're going to fix. And we're going to stay here until you get your money back from your investment with us. And that shouldn't be a hard scary thing for us because it's just doing, I mean, this is stuff I do regularly. This is what chris us regularly. We look at the offers, we take, tweak it and test it. So let's do the map, you know, if you, hold on a second, if we sell it for $100,000 to buy a buy.
00:41:46 - Seth Ellsworth
Is that one other, one other thing that I think is a big little mover for John, like he wants his team to be top notch. And I get, I get the fee feeling that his CEO, Skip Johnson, and Amanda Dobson are new. I think he wants, I think he wants them to be trained. So that is another level of this. like, Hey, we're 100 K and 30 K per. Order, like we'll be fixing this optimizing it, making sure your team is fully capable of running with it and the understanding the strategy behind it because we've taught them what we've done and why. So that they could potentially build other assets without us.
00:42:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, effectively, effectively working ourselves out of a job. So then maybe you sell it for it's 100 K plus for 90 days. And then it's. 150k for six months, which is a lot less for the follow-up, and we'll train your team. They can show up to all the calls where we are working together and diving into this. We will explain it. We will document it through a loom process of, look, this is what we built. This is the psychology behind it. This is how we analyzed it. This is why it's working. These are the things, the team that we need, you need an automation person, you need a copy person. We can tell you how to hire these people, you potentially, we'll do that. I think that's the, because honestly, an extra $50,000 for the three-month-light positioning at that way, 100k, it's 90 days. This is everything that we're building, and we're going to need, you know, An omniscience people were gonna have two copywriters like there's a lot to be built and and outline what has to be built Right, so there's the landing pages. There's the sales pages. There's the follow-up sequences that Nurture the people who didn't purchase from the landing page to the cell page For however many weeks and then there's the actual experience that is replacing a live event So you're talking about high-level Strategy that we're applying it to going through all of your material Making sure that we're choosing the best stuff and then turning it into experience like that is a lot of Mental work and we're paying high-level people to do it You mean Chris whoever else you know, we're we're looking at the stuff. So that's that's a lot and Then on top of that rather than building your dependency And then upon us, you know, obviously you're going to want to keep this skill and how as much as you can, we'll train your people to do it. And it won't really be an extra step. We're not going to say we're going to certify your people doing it, right, that they can do it. We're just going to make sure that they've got everything they need, which will be easy because what we're doing, if you want your clients to be really happy and you want to be able to get a raving testimonial, but you have to show them what you've done. have to show your work. So we'll create loom videos where we go through and say, here's everything we've done and broke it down so that they know and then we'll show them the data like, here was your baseline data. Here's what you were making. Here's this new offer. a completely new offer, right? Here's the revenue it's made. So we'll have evidence to show them so that they're like, I'm very happy I paid this money with you. I can see your results. That same material will work to train. There are other people because we'll show them this is what we did.
00:46:01 - Seth Ellsworth
This is the details of what we did.
00:46:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's one action, two benefits, and but also two values. We're not selling them on the reporting. It's just what's going to happen. We're selling them on training their team, but training their team is going to happen as a result of the reporting.
00:46:25 - Seth Ellsworth
Seven cents. Yep. So really just high level questions first about what's driving the revenue and then what do they want more of? What do they want less of? Customize our pitch to either that event based thing or selling the $39 thing for whatever reasons they want. then the offer under K over 90 days done for you 30k per quarter from there on out. Just stay on as long as they want. All this based on the fact that they want more revenue, they want less time spent, less resources spent, most likely, and their email game is currently abysmal.
00:47:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Non-existent.
00:47:16 - Seth Ellsworth
Yeah, so let's say their angle is, like for us, we also have quick wins, for example, when somebody opts in to anything, we just add the little reply trick, and that is a forced multiplier for the health of their email list as a whole, which is huge. They have a huge, huge list. I don't think it's efficient. I don't think they have access to their whole list, because it doesn't seem that they're the email very well, but they do have a very big audience on social media.
00:47:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
have lots of assets. So, that's something else that you could bring down, like if you're going to do a... atomized invoice, the email health and an email audit, you could call it, but you can put a price point on that and you have to, you can put down why it matters, why it's necessary, you know, so if they're like, well, what is it? Because most of time, the biggest thing that you'll get, so people that pay the most expect the least, the difference is, what am I getting for my money? That's a conversation that you'll have. What does my $100,000 get? People with the least amount of money, they want to be told you're going to make X amount of dollars with it, right? They don't want that atomized details. They want to know the mouthwatering details. People that pay a lot of money just want the bullet list because they can look at the value themselves. So the email audits, why it banners, you can break it down, open rights, conversion rights, follow up sequences, inbox placement, email help, all of these things are, and you can say like how much money do you spend on email, on your email holds, how big is your list, like how much money are you bleeding, and I don't know how much you want to get involved into it, but if you're going to be doing an email sequence, I would imagine that needs to be part of your service anyway, which is going and getting their sender score, and figuring out getting a report, you know, what's their domain health, what's their domain score, where are they emailing from, all of that, an email audit should be built into it, and it should be high value. So that, you know, look if I'm going to have you build all these emails, are they even going to get to the inbox? of your people, and what types, like where are you sending from, all these things. Anyway, so an itemized invoice of here's the copy, here's the automations, I don't know if you want to do that, I don't know, we really have to think about that, and I think looking at it will help us make a decision. Do we do it that way, or do we not put a price point next one, but say these are the things that we're going to do, email audit, write the copy, here's the types of copy that we're going to be doing, X amount of landing pages, a range of landing pages, a range of email follow-up sequences that are solely to ascend the opt-in person, the lead to sales, and then the email experience is a whole separate thing, right? That is the primary chunk of of everything. But for the email experience to work right and to work best, it means all of these other pieces into it. And then there's the analyzing, right? The iterations and optimizations, all the things that happen. So if you're putting together an itemized list and you're not putting, I would not put a price next to each of the things, but I would create an invoice. And this really should be your offer. And it will be specific to them, but you'll be able to model it for other people because it's going to be very, very, very similar, right? Which is these are the things that we're offering. So the small thing that leads to the big thing, so that there's a whole ascension process, the $39 all the way up to whatever the, become a certified, whatever, RTT. person, a therapist, in that thing, in their specific skill sets, in their therapy, that's telling me my brain right now. I'm also looking at like all their different words and things on the page while I'm looking at this, my brain is reading one word and saying another. Anyway, that's what it should be, so we should have that ready in a Google Doc, so we show up, we ask them all the questions, and ask them the questions. Basically, it's going to solidify what we already know, and it may allow us to tweak, so plan on some conversation back and forth between you and I in the background, as the call is happening, and then we give them the offer, and you have to decide what you want the price point to be, it's $100,000 $150,000. But the burden is that you have to convince them that they're going to get their money back and grow from it. Because, I mean, why spend their time if all they're going to do is just get their money back. They need it to grow. needs to be more than what they put in time and energy. Coming out with a better marketing team as a result of it, because you've gone through and got data. So, you're going to want to ask these questions. And are there marketing people going to be there on the call, do you know?
00:53:40 - Seth Ellsworth
So far as I know, I'm at Adopson and Skip Johnson, the CEO and the CMO, are as well as Marissa and John Davies are to be on there. Okay.
00:53:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, we're going to want to ask very specific questions, which will reveal what they know. they don't. So we're going to want to ask, okay, um, do you have a heat map on your pages? What percentage, like, okay, how much traffic do you get?
00:54:11 - Seth Ellsworth
Hold on a second. Where's my question? can figure that out.
00:54:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can figure what out.
00:54:16 - Seth Ellsworth
The heat map. I can just find the code on there.
00:54:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, you're missing the point. That's not the point. The point is we want to show what they know. So, um, do you have a heat map? It's a focus on what the point is there. Heat map. How many unique visitors per month? What's the bounce rate?
00:54:45 - Seth Ellsworth
What's the bounce rate?
00:54:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How long did people say? Do people stay on site? primary traffic sources, and what's the average time per landing page version great for offer. For average part value, per offer, or TV, per customer, per channel, per offer. Guarantee you they don't know these answers, almost nobody does. If they know them, they have an amazing marketing team, but we know that they don't have an amazing marketing team, because if they did, they'd be doing a better job of emailing, right? Okay, so what these questions are going to reveal is your marketing team isn't looking at what they need to do again, because the marketing team is going to be there and they're not going to have the answers. So if you don't know these things, do you have analytics we can review because we need days answers to optimize what you're doing. So that allows you to add in to your value offer, and you can cut it if you don't need it, but it should already be in a Google Doc with everything that we're offering, which is because we will train your marketing team on how to... make sure that you're optimizing all of your sources and that they know all of these things, but also they can review the results of your marketing efforts to make sure that each of these things that we're looking at is at optimal levels. And you just, that's just part of your value stack up. Here's the price point, but here's all the things that we're gonna get. So you're gonna, all these questions should reveal numbers and data and all that data should sell your offer for you.
00:57:43 - Seth Ellsworth
Seems to me we'd have to send all this stuff prior to.
00:57:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, you just have to have it written ahead of time because if you send it prior to, you miss the opportunity of revealing what's not known because they, their people can go scramble and look for these things. You need the CEO to know that their people don't know this stuff. And you need everybody to be exposed on the call that they don't know this stuff. So because they need to hire you. They know they need to hire you. they don't want to do is pay the price. What they don't want to do, their team doesn't want to be exposed. It's not knowing it. Why aren't you doing this? But what they want most is to break that $20 million a year ceiling and work less hard and have the money that they want to have. If they want those results, they have to get out of their own way. Why didn't they get out their own way to begin with? Because nobody confronted them with what they need to see.
00:58:56 - Seth Ellsworth
All right. Can you send me that? Nope. Can you copy it over?
00:59:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah So we have a looking at the Looking at the calendar invite we have a total of a half an hour Yeah, do you think they're gonna want to stop talking to you so if they do like first of all you ask all these questions really quickly when you have them And if your pitch is prepared you can get to them quickly I'm just posting it in the bottom of your work flow. You can move it put it wherever you want to so Eat the Having less time can just mean that they're foaming at the mouse dinner because they're like holy crap They just showed us everything we don't have and Everything we don't have is clearly why we're not getting where we want to be They also just showed us how they can give it to us and they're gonna they their brain's going to need to close that loop. Either we're hiring them or we're not. But if we are, then we need to figure this out if we need it, we need to get there.
01:00:10 - Seth Ellsworth
Yeah.
01:00:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, and you can tell them, look, only take on one of these a quarter. So, you know, I just want to, I think that this is ideal. I love what you're doing. I love what you're teaching people. You know, here's why I think what you do matters and why I want to be a part of it. And here's why I think what you're doing matters and why the world needs more of you. And here's what we're going to do to get that for you. also to make sure that you've got enough energy to keep serving because people need you. And this is how we're going to make it less work so that you can conserve that energy. We'll build this experience that can keep going. Even when you can't like that.
01:01:09 - Seth Ellsworth
I got those notes. A couple of thoughts. Thing number one, I'm just looking at my pension to way over deliver. I look at their four buckets that they have on their freebie page. They're four different audios. And I'm like, well, why don't we just build a four or five six day thing for each of those. And then, but that's four of these, which is four times the work.
01:01:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's your upsell after we've done what we're going to do. If you want to keep working with them. And if you don't, you can just say, hey, here's what I recommend. Go apply what we've taught you to each of these. Have your team do it.
01:02:01 - Seth Ellsworth
Do you want to consult with me?
01:02:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, here's a fee for consulting on it, and we'll have your team build it, but this my recommendation to you It's not where you should focus because you want to make them more money Right, so either way we should just focus on one of these channels one experience That we have a high probability of being home run because that's where most of the revenue is already coming from And then the 30 the 30k per quarter is essentially just for oversight and consulting And you don't want to package up like that. No Because they'll know if you say that they're gonna be like why am I paying that much for oversight and consulting?
01:02:52 - Seth Ellsworth
No So how do I How How do I not
01:03:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Stell myself into a corner why offering what I just told you so to me that leaves like a it leaves like a okay then what do we build next why are you even thinking about that i don't know it's more my mind naturally goes oh that's your problem you keep trying to extend things when instead of letting them finish and be done right maybe probably because i care more about the recurring revenue oh i was just about to tell you that's exactly what it is because you're like i got to pay the next month's bill you don't need to look at them for doing that so if you sell this and if you sell another one or two to other people with ending right and you want it to end because that's your wow factor and your wow factor is what gives you the big price points. You don't want to stay in somebody's team. You don't want to stay in their business. We let them come back to you for one-off consulting or something or whatever, but just go in, do the wow, then leave and leave them wild. So they keep telling people about your wow factor. But don't get in the grind of their business and having to and feeling like you're a part of their team, because then you lose the leverage that that gives you your price point, but also the energy and the way that they see you. And it's important for everything that you're doing with your high level people that that's how that stays, that dynamic stays that way. The money that we get from this needs to be budgeted so that there's money going to building out your own scalable office. That's where your next money is coming from. It's not from here. There is a very clear ending process we build the thing we leave if you want more you can ask us for more We'll give you a price point and it's not going to be stressed And you're not going to be built into a thing to be only thing that you're going to do from this point is consults Because we'll we'll tell you your team how to do it if you want to pay a higher price We'll even go hire people for your team to put in there and we'll teach them, but there's always an ending period So in this scenario, you wouldn't You wouldn't do a Risk reversal scenario where you'd say hey, it's a hundred K We'll stick around until you double that Sure, I would and there's no reason not to because that's not building you into a truck Because there's no way there's not enough potential for that money and
01:06:00 - Seth Ellsworth
Do you think it would be silly to to go for some type of a percentage?
01:06:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because this is the first time you've even tried this offer. Get some, get some evidence under your belt, get some more experience. Now you can do it at the end and say, if you want to keep me, here's how you can do it. It's a percentage.
01:06:27 - Seth Ellsworth
Because if that were the upsell instead of the 30k per quarter, that's a hell yes.
01:06:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and I don't even know where you got the 30k per quarter afterwards. No, the first like $100,000 for the, no, actually it was the response to yours. Like we go through and look at the transcript. When I was looking at, if you want to make it $150,000 for six months, and it wasn't considered Salting it was 30k per quarter. Basically we're building out these things. It wasn't like that.
01:07:05 - Seth Ellsworth
It wasn't 30 paper quarter for consulting I'm not sure where that came from Yeah Um, I would love to do 100k for building one of these and then they pay a percentage for us to go in and build out the other three That would be awesome Or four or five or six of these Okay, well don't get ahead of yourself because you've never had a yes on this offer at all No, I haven't And never built it Yeah, that's an end zone that I would that's an end zone that I would love for this particular business because It is A high degree of confidence with this one Um Well, there's so many unknowns including managing the team and and doing the whole thing together So I really want you to focus on what we've already talked about Yep, I'm part of minimizing it putting it on one
01:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
clear offer was to start to finish and I'm not going it would be cool if like just don't do that because that can sabotage everything if we get through this and then you want to be it would be cool all day long go do that but first you need a confident sale that you can close that you can take care of the family with you can have a team that you can build out your own offer which is going to take your time and focus and and be very very very practical with this there's lots of time for it would be cool if later and there'll be lots of opportunities but right now it just needs to be here's the offer here is that we can just knock it out of the park and this is what we're going to do for it cool and then in terms of price points like how do how do we be
01:09:00 - Seth Ellsworth
that we haven't taken swing yet. How do we confidently value this?
01:09:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Build out what I told you, which is the, like, itemized invoice that doesn't have a price point on it, right? But here's all the thing you're building. So quickly, repeat back to me what I said we're building.
01:09:20 - Seth Ellsworth
You asking me that or is that what I should ask them?
01:09:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I'm asking you.
01:09:26 - Seth Ellsworth
Well, I don't know exactly because it would be slightly different depending on whether it's the event based version or the low ticket front end.
01:09:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It should not be the low ticket front end and you shouldn't give them that option. If you want to knock it out of the park, you mean tell them let's experience it by your event into an email experience. But to build up to that, we'll take one of the low ticket options to build up to that and bridge a gap because if you want to get your money back, then There has to be high level stuff if you're trying to get if you're gonna be there till they get their money back at a $100,000 with a $39 offer you can be there forever Certainly they have six hundred thousand people on their email list Yeah, how many people do you think actually open it and how many people are even still valid email?
01:10:19 - Seth Ellsworth
You don't know anything about their email help I don't But you can assume it's crap We can assume it's crap. They're also flying ads and they have very active socials. So there's a lot of available to them Okay, so how many thirty nine? Here's here's how I see this taking Taking their hypnosis audios that they're currently giving away as a lead magnet Turning that into an automated email-based experience that converts it 30% to the $39 thing That's easy. That would be a very very simple simple thing, taking a live event and automating that to get the same result as or some result, no, not even similar, doesn't have to be someone that's either way, taking a live event and putting it into this type of a structure much more difficult. Is it possible?
01:11:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
course it is.
01:11:23 - Seth Ellsworth
It's much better.
01:11:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The bottom line is done right up today because we need to have time to tweak it. The itemized, what the invoice would be. So you asked, how do I confidently sell that $100,000? This is how. If you can't write it out and look at that and go, hell yeah, that's a $100,000 offer and also it's not going to be a whole ton of work for me because I'm having other people do it, then there you go. And if you can't do that, maybe you don't need to have a call for it. So write it up send it over Thursday.
01:12:02 - Seth Ellsworth
can work on Tweaking it and make sure we've got it nailed down and then probably see what happens Yeah, I think I think we should probably be prepared for Both options the event based one or the That the hypnosis audio version That seems to me that they're right there. I'm just Green with the way you just said It seems to you what it seems to me that if they've turned their focus to the thirty nine dollar a month thing for whatever reason So they've spent a lot of money all ready To to grow that It'll be interesting to see What their priorities are versus where they're currently generating their revenue, which has got to be the events To me it make that makes the most that's you're going to make more $15,000 sales from the event than you are from any other, they're not doing any other marketing. So it has to be from the events. What is it already wise? Is it the event or is it this new $39 thing? That'll be interesting because the revenue won't likely justify focusing on the $39 thing, like you said. But they may see that as their path to getting off the hamster wheel. I don't know.
01:13:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so to break even on a $100,000 investment in us on the $39 offer, we need about 2,500 sales. But if there's an episode, if there's something else next, $1,000 or $2,000 offer, and maybe it's something in becoming a therapist or whatever the next step is. There's some gap that we don't know about that exists, some mid-level offer that is not an event that we're replacing, but it could be the training or whatever, maybe a certification process or pre-certification process where you can sell it for, whether it's a few hundred or a thousand or two thousand, you know, the burden on that, $100,000, a hundred people buying $1,000 offer, and with that amount of traffic that they have, that's a no-brainer like that. We could do that easily. So I think that there's a missing piece there that we could plug in, which was one of the things I was thinking about before, and I don't remember how $39 members to $15,000 sales. Well, are they getting $39 members to $15,000?
01:14:55 - Seth Ellsworth
Sure they are, because he mentioned that the whole point of that group. It was to nurture them, to ascend to the bigger things.
01:15:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there, and there could be segments, you know, are there different types of things that they teach? they teach one thing, and so maybe they ascend them up through, instead of going straight to the $15,000 thing, it's, well, there's this aspect, right? This is, let us teach you about CBT, it's $1,000, let us teach you about the hemotherapy, it's $1,000, you know, and step them up through something. There's a path, and there's missing data points, where we can do that, but what they need to understand is that your way of doing it isn't just email, it's a very specific way based off of psychology, which they should appreciate that speaks to them, and uses, know, accountability, and actually is very much CBT, because it's getting into the head, like, who are you, what do you want, why are you doing what you're doing, are you watching? yourself behave the way you're behaving, is it getting you the outcome that you want? No, it's not. So you need to change your behavior. So here's how you change your behavior and changing your behavior is, you know, leaving them through a sale at the same time. That's what you've been doing. It is very related to CBT, which is observing your behavior, asking yourself if the current behavior that you have is getting the results that you want or not. And if it's not, then what are some options for how you can behave to get more of what you want. And then as you're watching yourself, are you seeing yourself through the right thing? Do the wrong thing? we get fixed it? That's it? That's the cognitive behavior there. It's a repeat.
01:16:56 - Seth Ellsworth
Okay. Awesome. By the way, I have heard back from Landon Ray.
01:17:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Have or have not?
01:17:06 - Seth Ellsworth
I have.
01:17:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And?
01:17:10 - Seth Ellsworth
He agreed to the 10K thing.
01:17:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is the 10K thing?
01:17:16 - Seth Ellsworth
Just a power day at onto Port Campus in June.
01:17:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice.
01:17:23 - Seth Ellsworth
So he's, I need to send him a one pager and he'll send, he'll get his accounting to send 5K and then 5K on the day of.
01:17:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good.
01:17:38 - Seth Ellsworth
So we've got some movement somewhere.
01:17:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So, I mean, I think for the most part, this week you've got, I know you have things that you have to fulfill and you need to get prepared for this. I don't know what else you have going on, but I would like to know what else you're going on. an appointment I need to get to. So I need to wrap up. But I think that this is going to go well. Either they're actually open to making the changes or not, but based off of the conversations that's happened so far, I would say that they are. And if you can just show them how, you know, this just makes perfect sense, but also clearly they need to stop chasing it. That conversation about, how much basically, how much harder have you had to work to get to that 20,000? Are you just coasting or have you had to work harder just to keep hitting that $20 million? And if you've had to keep working harder, how long can you do that? if 20 million is the number and you can't keep chasing harder and harder and harder, then you have to go smarter. this is what we've got, and you know, break it all down. It'll be important to Like, at some point, guaranteed, I've never been to a call where there wasn't something that was high value that I could add to it. They need to be primed for just even listening. So decide how you want to represent me. But it works best if you've done that ahead of time. This is Tina. This is what she's bringing to the table. So if I ask a question, because everybody's ego is a little bit different. I don't imagine they're going to be high ego people, but it could be. Um, so it's sometimes people like who knows this and why they ask them questions. So it's best to avoid that by pre-framing this, who she is. That's what she does.
01:19:46 - Seth Ellsworth
Yep. I already, I think I already did that past. Yeah. And my, in my original email, which you didn't see. Um, I said, I don't do anything without. her. She keeps from painting myself into a corner.
01:20:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There you go. That's enough. So that way, if there's there's anything I want to help out with, and I'm just like, I know I can add some power value to here, then then it'll be there for the most part. I'm just going to be quiet supporting and texting back and forth. But if I sense that there's a way that I'm like, okay, well, I can answer this question powerfully and clearly, then I'll do that.
01:20:28 - Seth Ellsworth
Awesome. I'll bring you in. Would you want me to, is this like a tag team thing, or would you just hop in? Meaning like, hey, Tina can speak to that.
01:20:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would probably just hop in. wouldn't even want to be to recall if I'm not hopping in, because then I can't be myself. And if I can't be myself, I don't want to be there.
01:20:55 - Seth Ellsworth
Awesome. So I will work on this invoice for both scenarios.
01:21:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because then you'll have an option. can just say you, without them knowing, just pick the one you want to show that and then go ahead and screen show so they can take look at it and break it down.
01:21:13 - Seth Ellsworth
If I had, if I had my druthers, what I would do for them, this would be, this is their entire business model. They have four of these running with their most successful four verticals that have proven to be the most profitable. They drive all of their traffic to those four. Those dump $39 per month members and then quickly ascends those who have achieved a high level of confidence with that and introduces the opportunity for a career with those things. Or it assesses their need for deeper therapy. And so all roads lead through this $1.39 month thing that liquefies at costs and makes it infinitely scalable, and we just pick people off and push them down each, each path based on, you know, any number of things that could happen. But we could build one of these to go on the inside that ascends them into the career.
01:22:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, and the great thing about this is that this is the type of thing that is perpetual evergreen lifelong. So whether you need therapy or you need to keep sharpening your own saw and being better at what you're doing. Come back to us as the authority for people that can help you, you know, continue your mental health journey, being as strong as you possibly can. So you live with us forever. That's the goal, right? Or, or same thing as becoming a therapist because the bottom line. as we all know that we need support and we're here to offer that to you. So whatever we need built is perpetual. mean evergreen not in terms of an offer that never expires but also your potential to stay with us as a customer lasts forever as well. And so we want to make sure that we show them that hey we're looking at it that way and we know that. And so one of the goals and the metrics would be life's and value their customer whatever is we want to increase that and extend that. And what you do says in the nurturing through email sequence has the greatest potential to do what should have already been on their radar and probably already the goal but probably not their success in the past.
01:23:48 - Seth Ellsworth
Yeah.
01:23:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I got to go but send me over what you come up with in your two versions and then we'll just you keep hammering that out. But I imagine that you'll probably show up to that call more confident that you have in any other cell call, even though it's the highest, like, have you ever sold any one thing for $100,000 for yourself?
01:24:15 - Seth Ellsworth
Um, I sold a website for 220.
01:24:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm about like this service something.
01:24:22 - Seth Ellsworth
No.
01:24:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, selling a website or business is a whole different thing. This is selling you as a service, um, doing this particular thing that there's been a lot of, well, just a huge lack of clarity and confidence. So going into this success way is a big deal. But I, your confidence seems to be growing and the clarity growing almost daily, definitely weekly. And I think that you have the potential just to go in and knock it out of the park Friday.
01:24:58 - Seth Ellsworth
Thank you. I was just saying, I think we can ROI these guys before we even build anything.
01:25:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Build anything before we build anything. Well, I don't know how, how you would do that without doing something. What do you mean? Well, I mean, before we build the experience, just, okay, don't say anything and then say the experience, but yeah, build that thing like just with a few tweaks, maybe you say that, but the language matters very much because that's almost like we can get your money back without doing anything. That's what it sounds like.
01:25:42 - Seth Ellsworth
Okay. that's not what I'm.
01:25:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So anyway, so like you could say something like where I think we can ROI just by making a few actually simple tweaks that we can implement into your system within a couple of days. that can start, you know, getting you money while we're building the big thing. The language is different, it takes more, but it's factual, and it's clear. You know it's clear because it's reflected as email, you know, and improved this type of thing, and that doesn't take a lot of effort. But that clarity makes a big difference because when you're not there, you create confusion. Confusion creates friction. Friction slows down sales. You don't want any confusion. You don't want any friction. So be very clear when you say anything on the call.
01:26:39 - Seth Ellsworth
Cool. right.
01:26:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
definitely have to go. Let's keep working this out. Work on the two different offers and send over what you got when you got it.
01:26:50 - Seth Ellsworth
Yeah. Thank you much.
01:26:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. You're welcome. Good talk. Talk to you soon.
01:26:54 - Seth Ellsworth
Bye.

Yeah, I'm just as nice as about it.
00:00:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What?
00:00:21 - mark sweet
I'm just asking the code.
00:00:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to set up a new computer and I have to everything's changed since the last time I've done it. Oh, good. Thank you.
00:01:24 - mark sweet
Yeah, sorry, I'm trying to get caught up on a couple of things I had America puts you other list of all the doctors that we've kind of worked with over the last year or so and then sort of put that in a map so that way we can start planning doctor trips basically. Nice. You really see about three to five people. It's true just more than that I can see a little bit too crazy.
00:01:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So trying to figure out how to Yeah, Marcus quiet again, that's what it is.
00:02:14 - mark sweet
Yeah, I'm always quiet.
00:02:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so even this looks different. If I didn't change, did it? Okay. Okay. It looks different.
00:02:57 - mark sweet
Might just be the view. There's a way to change on the different view.
00:03:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is the view not set by user?
00:03:08 - mark sweet
Yeah, but I don't know if I had to change around an octave and plan around with some AI implementation stuff.
00:03:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I don't know how to get to where I want to go.
00:03:26 - mark sweet
Do you want to share a screen and then?
00:03:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Oh, . I did not know what happened here. I mean, I guess it's fine, but, uh, where's screen share? Seriously, everything looks different. That's tough. Even that's like, it's not showing me which thing I'm sharing. I've got to see if this is the right one allows you to open some some settings. Sorry, I've got. All these things to set up. Can you see my screen?
00:04:11 - mark sweet
Nope.
00:04:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. Let's try this again. Oh, that's why. It's not going to let me do it unless I quit it and reopen it.
00:04:32 - mark sweet
Got it.
00:04:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry. So I can tell you what I can't. I need to screen share. Hi, Dan. you good? I'm going to do this quiet today.
00:04:50 - mark sweet
I don't hear anything, Dan. I heard it. You did, but I don't hear anything.
00:04:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Listen up.
00:04:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I hear it.
00:05:00 - mark sweet
Yeah, Dan has arrived.
00:05:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dan did the accidental video last week. He was like, how do I turn this off? I have that same situation today. Only I didn't know. We should just do video one day and actually see each other. I do video with my, my lady friends. Sorry, that's James loud. Okay. I can't. I don't want to end the call, but I can't see little. So maybe somebody else in screen. Sure. We can go over numbers that way because I, hey, Dan, can you log in the little fire and see if it looks different to you? Because you have this in the log and I use.
00:05:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Different. Different. Different. What's different?
00:05:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, the layout. I don't know how to navigate to the reports.
00:05:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I want. Okay. Let me see.
00:06:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see, I didn't think that's one. Let's scroll down.
00:06:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Hello. Working on it.
00:06:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I don't have I mean, no, it doesn't look like this. Okay, so I used to see at the top all these different menus, and one of them was reports, and one of them was dashboards, or maybe dashboards was under reports, but for the whole long list of things that are not there anymore.
00:07:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
more. Yeah, I mean, I see them as normal.
00:07:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Why would I not see them?
00:07:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And you're logged in as Lauren?
00:07:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is the only one that there is.
00:07:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:07:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it can't screen share because I haven't set up zoom permission yet on this laptop. And it won't let me do it unless I turn it off and back on. So Anyway, sorry for wasting time. Can somebody, can we look at our numbers?
00:07:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's somebody me because I'm on my phone so I can switch to my laptop.
00:07:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think Mark's in the office.
00:07:42 - mark sweet
Yeah. I gave mine just my nose. That's little different.
00:07:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. You don't have the same dashboard that we do?
00:07:47 - mark sweet
I don't know anyone.
00:07:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Alrighty.
00:07:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't worry. Monday Monday.
00:07:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Indeed.
00:08:00 - mark sweet
You want to make me host?
00:08:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Wait, that should automatically allow multiple participants. You should be able to just share.
00:08:15 - mark sweet
Oh, yeah.
00:08:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, I have that setting. If you need to make it a bit bigger than me. Like, zoom completely looks different on this laptop. it's still a Mac, so I'm just not expecting all these changes. Okay, and take Swiss or Swiss State. All right. Oh, so let me get back to my notes while I'm a second, which is also different. I'm going to show a contributor. Teamwork. Sorry, teamwork is now on here, too. So to go through some of my stuff. Uh-uh. It did actually start this 10 minutes early to be prepared. I just didn't know I was going to need more than that. I apologize, sweetheart.
00:09:35 - mark sweet
It's usually a little bit of a tip.
00:09:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's that?
00:09:40 - mark sweet
This is the other one that we tend to look at.
00:09:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I mean, it's looking good. It's the 17th. It looks better than it has at this point in the month for the last several months.
00:09:56 - mark sweet
Yeah, but there's usually a week slow down.
00:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know if it's going to be this week, next week.
00:09:59 - mark sweet
Right. Right. Right. Right. But it is what it is, quantify seems to be a pretty big success, the only problem is they really can't scale.
00:10:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what is the ceiling, what's the cap, like, if they can do that?
00:10:20 - mark sweet
the next year, like, maybe 20%. So it was another like two to three needs per state, it wasn't a lot. Well, at least they're being honest. Right. No, you're not wrong, you're not wrong.
00:10:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is something. Oh, sorry.
00:10:42 - mark sweet
The cost per acquisition is pretty solid with it. We'll keep that going. wish I had two or three more of them, obviously, but it is what it is.
00:10:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is their cost per acquisition?
00:10:56 - mark sweet
3500, I have the exact number somewhere, but it's around there. So, yeah, about half what monkey is, yeah, but monkeys are the best attorney's fees. So we're going to keep monkey on again. The biggest issues on Felipe, their costs and their average attorney fees very close to each other. So the $300 difference doesn't make any sense. You've got to feed the beast at some level, but if you talk to them, I had them full, basically, from Washington because it's just not working. We go state by state to put more money into New Mexico and Arizona, which should help. Because they're doing well in Arizona in New Mexico, but doing really poorly in Washington.
00:11:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, my gosh. I saw another sweet James freaking billboard. I don't like how that guy looked. You saw a sweet change billboard? Yes, because I'm in Arizona.
00:12:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I'm only like an hour and a half away from Lauren's right now. Oh, that makes sense.
00:12:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:12:15 - mark sweet
Inks and Phoenix.
00:12:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, he's in Phoenix?
00:12:19 - mark sweet
Hank.
00:12:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, Hank. Yeah. Yeah.
00:12:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know.
00:12:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm I'm in Tempe. Oh, yes. You're close. Yeah. Yep.
00:12:32 - mark sweet
So you are near where we're stuck here.
00:12:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was in Gilbert Saturday.
00:12:41 - mark sweet
I went to the temple. A of C physical medicine.
00:12:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was in Chandler this morning.
00:12:48 - mark sweet
They're like. Like. So I had America put this together where we've sent a lot of. Cases too. So we're trying to plan trips.
00:12:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that.
00:13:00 - mark sweet
It's lot easier to go from here to here than like here to here.
00:13:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. That's really smart.
00:13:08 - mark sweet
So we'll show up with that together.
00:13:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look at the big brain from you. Yes, let's not do that or fall down any stairs at parties either. It's supposed to laugh. No, they laughed. Come on. We don't remember this story. Listen, if you guys are going to be this boring on a Monday, I'm going to leave.
00:13:42 - mark sweet
Wow.
00:13:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here I am now. Entertain me. Come on. All right. So also just not being on my normal computer. It's very disruptive to my brain. So let me go back to now. Right. Our sources. So let's go down the source. Let's real quick, um. After math, we still don't engage that's gone now, right?
00:14:21 - mark sweet
Yeah. I mean, that's just the chat on the website. think that really was much of anything.
00:14:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so do you have any other potential? What do call those vendors? Talk to you. And what is your process like for? Do you do you set aside a day, a week, a month, whatever to go look for some things? Like how are you coming across them? Um, through the grapevine is an intentional. Is it as it happens?
00:14:59 - mark sweet
Some ambitious Google. playing and trying to find it and just giving them 10 grand to see what's going to happen. And again, most of these are going to fail.
00:15:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:15:08 - mark sweet
Most likely. So it's just more of that asking the after hours call center. And then obviously this HQ intake that they've worked with that have had decent results because they want more business. So it's pretty clear in that regard. Beyond that, they don't have a lot else.
00:15:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Google searches, there's not anybody that you haven't tried yet.
00:15:39 - mark sweet
The only one that I haven't tried is Quintessa. But given how often she gets sued, I don't really want to try her. So that's the only big one that we haven't.
00:15:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I was going to say there's many a fly by night of their own.
00:15:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Same. Random thought, but. So let's say there's somebody that's a newer SEO company getting attorney leads, but they're only doing it in Montana and they're small, know, so they don't think about advertising in California. What if you did a search for attorney leads in Montana to find some little thing that little, you know, agency mama pop shop who's doing a good job with that in Montana that maybe has a different kind of approach or something. I don't know, like I'm just trying to think out of the box and where we could find skill and talent that's kind of flying under the radar, but also price-wise is going to be lower. Maybe it's not possible because they're still have to be getting attention in your area with all the competition, but it's worth trying.
00:16:58 - mark sweet
I mean my own concern of course is When you go from a less competitive to a more competitive state, you generally don't do very well versus the alternative.
00:17:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:17:09 - mark sweet
if you were able to kick out some California, you'll kick out some Montana. But I think if you're looking for like New Mexico specifically, Missouri specifically, I've just been looking more generally. It may not be a bad plan to kind of do town per state.
00:17:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so can we make that a specific action item of. Looking per any of the states that you're currently in or potentially looking to be in.
00:17:41 - mark sweet
Yeah, that's a good idea. think I should do that because I'm. Pretty well, I'm on page like seven or eight at this point. So the quality is not.
00:18:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You So when will you do that so that I know when I can follow up with you about having checked it out?
00:18:06 - mark sweet
I'm probably not going to be adding a new lead source for at least the next 30 or 45 days because I want to see how quantified it's going to kind of finish out and how absurdly does since we started giving them some more money.
00:18:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, starting though and doing the research and having conversations just to know that they're there because there's a whole process. I mean, would you be not be willing to look into it first?
00:18:33 - mark sweet
Yeah, just usually processes. Okay, would you leave?
00:18:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, give me money.
00:18:38 - mark sweet
Give me money. Here we go.
00:18:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Dan, Eric, make this happen. It's literally 72 hours.
00:18:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, all right.
00:18:48 - mark sweet
It's fun to know it takes the longest period of time, so you're right though. I mean, it's been a little bit of time with that.
00:18:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and I mean, and if we could find a few quantified five who don't know how to scale but can compete at that level like getting even two to three leads for 3500 and depending on what the attorney fees on those I mean a handful of those would be amazing right no um you're absolutely right it's just finding those kind of folks right you lost a lot of money uh so far but that's okay yeah but there's there's no way we're winning without trying I think we just keep also true um and the rotation of who is the the primary you know winner monkey versus walker versus Felipe has done much better at times um the cost per vendor but also the cost per state there's so much variance and I mean it all it all You know, so the more levers we have to move, the more control we have over the movement. So, but that doesn't come. It just doesn't fall in your lap. So that's my pitch. Just let's keep at it. Okay. Let me go down here. Mark wants to know if we can have a widget made in our management dashboard that says conversion rate. Dan, do you have anything to report back on that?
00:20:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Josh hit up Stacy. was like very apologetic. guess their firm has been super busy. He's like, I've actually been working at the firm. But he said he would have all the last round of stuff done today or tomorrow.
00:20:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Cool.
00:20:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, I mean, we can send him more stuff.
00:20:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. All right. don't know. I don't think I found him. that properly. I know it's in here in recording, but I don't know how to get it to highlight yet. So, the next one was, um, status of unified beta functions. Mr.
00:21:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think we're, he's just waiting, right? Yeah, that hasn't been released.
00:21:26 - mark sweet
It hasn't been, we put in all the packages that we need to implement. so now it's just on let it find.
00:21:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:21:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, okay. intake scripts. sent something over.
00:21:51 - mark sweet
Yeah, um, I wasn't thrilled with it. Just, it wasn't thrilled. So I had Patsy kind of put together the basics of what we need, and then it was A to put his spin around it, I guess, right? If he's the best guy on the phone, having him put together script makes the most sense, right? Here's what we've had before. Here's what we're doing. I'll send you what he made, but I wasn't super happy.
00:22:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then what's the next step to get to something that you are happy with?
00:22:41 - mark sweet
We're trying to go back through it, and Patsy's been on vacation for the last five or six days.
00:22:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you know, like, I'm pretty good at this chat GPT thing and have been from the beginning, so we ever want to have the AI session on down. seriously could you like have some caffeine or something both of you gee oh my god I've been up since 430 because the certain little black somebody is not loving this cray training I'm like oh my god you know we're talking about kids you don't send me dog pictures Dan what I want to do this look into a pool this weekend you what that the pool oh there you go what into the pool the dog look look look running oh my god well he can swim right yes and he help me by the way dress super fast oh but he shook a lot oh okay hold on a second where the great training oh my gosh that lasts for like two years for me horrible until
00:24:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They're really generous already. She's a chewer already.
00:24:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Is she a lab? No, told me she's something German Shepherd.
00:24:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What's hilarious is the other German Shepherd. The first two minutes, it was like, Oh . This might not go well. She was like, and she freaked out and Denise was like legit scared. I'm like, Oh, and then it was like, all right, let's keep, keep them set. Of course, I'm, I tell them like, Hey, don't just bring the dog in the house. Don't just walk in the door with the puppy. Like we have to let her. What do they do? They just walk right in the house and be like, Oh my God. So Zinnia freaks out. And now she's like the mom follows the puppy around everywhere. Dangle toys out of her mouth to get the puppy to chase her. was like, this is great. It's like a built-in babysitter. perfect. Although she doesn't like the crate training either. can tell you that because she was all over again last night.
00:25:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, go away. Um, I'll, yeah. What was funny to me is my, my Bishan, like, she didn't like the crate, but then when the alternative was that or my girls, she was like, I'll take the crate because your kids are crazy. yeah, I feel safe here. Okay. Um, so I put that in house box. Intake. Oh, so the question, we need the legitimate answer, like the real answer, not if it's not going to be chat dbt, like, what's the next step for improving the intake script?
00:25:47 - mark sweet
I'm just going to sit down with Jose and pass it when she's back from our vacation, go through it again. We've had better scripts before. I mean, look, this is still better than what we've got right now, something new home. I sent to you guys, but It needs some simplification right now. It's just mostly you're surrounded around the questions they have to have answered, which I mean, again, it's good that everyone knows what we need to have answered. But I need a little more help on the, how you greet people and, you know, how you get into it.
00:26:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. So. Have these having a baby though, right?
00:26:26 - mark sweet
Yep.
00:26:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So she's on vacation now. She's not on my turn. And she's leaving and she's not coming back, right?
00:26:33 - mark sweet
No, she's coming back.
00:26:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Personally, I thought like.
00:26:40 - mark sweet
She's gonna for at least six months. longer.
00:26:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:26:48 - mark sweet
So we're actively looking again for a new intake manager.
00:26:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's that going?
00:26:56 - mark sweet
Not great. No, not great. A lot of ex-suite James people, but yeah.
00:27:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've seen that dude's picture, I can get it. You know how some people just look proctorial?
00:27:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I guess.
00:27:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you, somebody's actually alive.
00:27:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm going to come over and check your pulses. I'm not sure. Are you talking about the glasses?
00:27:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
are we talking about?
00:27:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. Yeah. he's not a good face person. Who is that? That's not Steve.
00:27:31 - mark sweet
James, divorce, complaint, and yeah.
00:27:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who is it? What?
00:27:38 - mark sweet
I didn't hear what you said because I was still talking about it. Sweet James, divorce, complaint.
00:27:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look it up.
00:27:44 - mark sweet
Is that your thing?
00:27:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:27:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hold on. Well, this is not an appropriate use of your time. Sweet James, divorce, complaint. I'll look it up later.
00:27:55 - mark sweet
No, it's highly entertaining.
00:27:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Enjoy.
00:28:00 - mark sweet
It's public resource. I'm not talking about anyone.
00:28:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's out there, right?
00:28:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Toby took Google something.
00:28:07 - mark sweet
That's legit. Yeah.
00:28:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will check that out later because seriously, I took a look at that and I was like, oh, not even speak to that person.
00:28:16 - mark sweet
So it doesn't matter. What we're learning is it doesn't matter. you have more money than anyone else, you win.
00:28:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Define winning.
00:28:27 - mark sweet
You get more cases. Well, I think you have three or four divorces.
00:28:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's not winning and a drug habit.
00:28:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that winning, Mark?
00:28:39 - mark sweet
For him it is, but yeah.
00:28:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh. You need to know that is not winning.
00:28:47 - mark sweet
It's fine.
00:28:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is earning and that's but that's not winning. The bill comes due, Mark.
00:28:57 - mark sweet
Look, they're doing well. I hope we keep doing well. But I would like them not to keep going in the states that I mean, because I think it's just not a very long matter of time until they're in Washington.
00:29:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dippola does a job of spreading.
00:29:09 - mark sweet
That's just what it does. Yeah, they just open up taxes so she keeps busy for a little while.
00:29:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so intake script, we're working on that. Okay, I just want to make sure we have time to get through everything.
00:29:24 - mark sweet
We got Hank going. We give him his first case. We have him mostly working on just the cases right now. It's where everyone starts. So just trying to get through some of those, which is good because it takes some of the pressure off. You know, the other attorneys because those are the ones that just take a lot of time. And not a huge great opportunity.
00:29:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So is he going to stay in Phoenix?
00:29:50 - mark sweet
Yeah, he lives in Phoenix.
00:29:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so.
00:29:54 - mark sweet
So him and Liz are in Phoenix. So the goals. Once he really understands what we do, so it's kind of started from the back end and moving. being forward. Then we'll keep building up this caseload. So we've obviously got to make sure we get plenty of Arizona cases for him and Lorenz. But Lorenz just got overlaid, just overwhelmed, it was just too many cases, too many files. he's just slow and he struggles with structure and everything else. So we need to bring someone else to help him.
00:30:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could be a training issue and Tina can help with that. Just say.
00:30:34 - mark sweet
Yeah, can I hire Tina to help train Patrick and Lorenz?
00:30:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Probably. Okay.
00:30:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me.
00:30:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes, my issue. It sounds like you could.
00:30:49 - mark sweet
Lorenz responded well to it originally, right? did what two sessions with him.
00:30:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He lit up the first call, but on the second call. Like, he hadn't stopped thinking about it. He is a perfect candidate.
00:31:08 - mark sweet
So as much as wish Sam or Tyler would do it, I just, I don't see it. I'd rather not waste money and time on them, but I think both Patrick and Lauren's are super highly trainable. So if you guys are okay with it, I think having you Tina meet with them at least once a month would make sense. Quite frankly, it takes some of the training of how to manage people off of me.
00:31:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And... Oh, I also talked to her differently.
00:31:36 - mark sweet
Yeah, that's true.
00:31:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, but the other thing is though, I have not had any success talking to anybody only once a month. Okay. It's just now there could be a difference between like meeting and talking, right? So there can be some type of team chat, whatever. or it can be text, it can be slack, whatever, to email, it can be email, but he would have to be very thorough in that and very truthful. The thing about calls, and I'll say that versus a meeting per se, because sometimes meetings are really inefficient, is that even without looking at somebody through their voice, I can hear their energy, I knew immediately Samantha was like polite in the beginning, but guarded, and Lorenz was very open. So anyway, but when people are emailing, it's less easy to interpret and to know that there's a problem, especially with people who are skilled at not revealing too much, which all attorneys have that skill, but you know what I mean? So at least every other week. And I don't know what your goals are. I don't know what the pace is.
00:33:04 - mark sweet
week is fine. mean, again, Michael's just to try to make them better for lack of better term. We're spending a lot of money on marketing, a lot of money on, you know, there are teams. So if we're able to make them more efficient, we get more money out of each case or able to more cases, that's a win.
00:33:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
attorneys, we don't get trained on how to manage people like they're still new, can train them anything.
00:33:30 - mark sweet
No, not really.
00:33:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. No, no things.
00:33:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was well, yeah, I mean, and just the results that we got with that little bit of time. But so, I mean, we could talk about it here offline, whatever, but every other week at the very least, but then we need to have weekly check ins and, you know, UVC seat on it. And included. So there's like an official kind of reporting process. I don't know, depending on what is comfortable, it's new in terms of like how I'm structured and modeling, but corporate world is not new to me. Doing the training is not new to me, I've been doing this for 28 years. So anyway, we just have to talk about like what the goals and what the structure are, but for sure once a month just isn't enough, there's too many things. After a week, people start slipping. So we could, let's just talk, because I need to think about it, but as a structure of talking on, and it could be half an hour, it doesn't have to be an hour. Like we have your whole business to go through top to bottom. We would, we'd have his, his team. So, you know, maybe the first couple of meetings are 60 to 90 minutes, and then it could probably go to half hour every other week with a structured email follow up and I have an idea of the overall goals, right? You want to have a certain level of attorney fees. You want to make sure that they're hitting targets for what do you call it? policy limits and just, I mean, I would get more information there probably than I have in a lot of our calls because he's like frontline with his team. So there are questions. I don't even know that I'd be asking right now that I would be asking. Yeah, I mean, if we, if that's time track, I would love to get them into that.
00:35:46 - mark sweet
I think that's not where we start, but yeah, I know, but they need a lot of help on how to work with their Wait, who both Lorenz and Patrick need a lot of help. I mean Patrick is really young, he's like 25. This is his first job out of law school really. So, you know, he needs a lot of help, not that it's fault in any way to shape or form. But, you know, if you say every week, every two weeks, every month, whatever you think they need, I'm four. But I want to try to straighten these team people because we're not funny, a lot better people out there, to be honest with you. So, go figure out how we can make them stronger.
00:36:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, we've been watching the hiring process with you for the last few years, so I get that. And that was a conversation we had in the beginning, too, hire B players and turn them into A players or sometimes C players and turn them into B plus players. yeah, the really, it just depends on how they do. Some people don't need a lot. And you give them a little something and they stay top of mind and they run with it. And so, We can kind of, we could come up with an ideal structure and then get some feedback going between you and me on how it's going if they need more, they need less. They need less and just build that in if you want to talk about that.
00:37:18 - mark sweet
Yeah. Dan, as a best friend, me and Tina to communicate on that or I don't know if figured that.
00:37:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
All right.
00:37:32 - mark sweet
Thanks for asking.
00:37:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Thanks for asking.
00:37:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. He's for not requiring me to do that.
00:37:37 - mark sweet
I don't want to go around people. Right?
00:37:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Sure.
00:37:40 - mark sweet
But yeah, I kind of figured you really want to be involved.
00:37:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You figured right.
00:37:46 - mark sweet
Okay.
00:37:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cool. Let's talk about the lead stuff and then I can check out of this call for the rest.
00:37:51 - mark sweet
Okay.
00:37:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cool.
00:37:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm doing the lead stuff right now.
00:37:56 - mark sweet
Yes. Yes. So. We need to change his right on loose deal that now we're getting some of those directly or that hasn't picked in yet.
00:38:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, they, they, so we, they were doing the routing. Right. We, we weren't. So Eric is talking to, I forget her name. I think what he's going to do is say, Hey, take off. This is my guess. He'll go. He'll tell her take HQ out as an email reference and then we'll handle rotating because they're not rotating at all. Right. They just were, they're just being duplicated in two places. So he can then apply a rotation to it. So it'll hit us first.
00:38:42 - mark sweet
And then he'll rotate in and out, in and out, in and Got it. Okay.
00:38:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then the other ones are done.
00:39:00 - mark sweet
Right. So the Sunday thing now is done. We're interested to see how that goes. mean, I only got one call a Sunday, but yeah.
00:39:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, yeah. And by, I mean, leads come in through the other things too. So, yeah.
00:39:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Mark, do you have any other things? Like, so you were asking about this still, like, what's on your agenda to go over today?
00:39:37 - mark sweet
We go over Rolex because that's ever certainly right.
00:39:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I just updated all their stuff. So a bunch of their stuff is ending. Not really just it just finished lastly. So there's not a lot. They got a bunch that are in and out of internal and with zoo. So probably have a better idea in the next day or two.
00:40:00 - mark sweet
Okay, I've seen a lot of the leads coming through, but I haven't seen anything of any value. So that's just why I was touching this a lot.
00:40:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. So a lot of their, I send them all the outcomes. So like I showed them and they refund. They're really good about that. So like anybody that's retained, they just refund. So I think two or three, I just updated that they already have, they were already retained. And then I send them whatever the whatever is in Littify or wherever I'm getting it from, right? So I'm either getting it from each Q sheet or I'm getting it from Littify here. But they just right now, they just have a bunch that are open. So there's nothing to really see yet.
00:40:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who is Russell? That's thirdly. Oh, okay. I'm safe to put that in my notes and teamwork, right?
00:40:55 - mark sweet
Because nobody outside of us sees that. Correct. Okay, we've been sending a ton to Morgan and and they seem to be signing up a bunch of them. So we've got paid their leads are legit, but our turn down reasons are also legit. That's sort of the interesting thing. Right.
00:41:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They're not, it's not like they got a ton of, oh, we can't get in touch with this person. It's limited no treatment gap and treatment like they're all whatever. So it makes me, I mean, I think after this round, I'll be like, hey, you guys, like, what does your form look like But they went and did the math. I was like, go show me the math of this. And they did it and they brought it back and I was like, okay, so they're, they seem like perplexed. They're like, why the you edition. could be working better. They have another guy in Washington where they're like, he's getting a better result. I go, well, you're seeing our turn down reason. So either he, either where they're signing cases that are subsequently going to get dropped, or they just signed cases in their bad lawyers, and they don't realize, hey, there's limited no treatment there, you shouldn't be signing that, which I 1000% believe could be true. But yeah, I'm like, that's the difference. You're seeing exactly why we're turning them down. They're not being turned down because they don't sound good on the phone. It's like, they are not a good fit. What like, they're not a good fit for that other firm either. They just don't know it. That's what I think might be happening.
00:42:48 - mark sweet
We'll see.
00:42:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But the math ultimately worked out in their first round. So it was like, okay, if we could keep that math. And then I told them, they didn't that they could do Spanish leads. And I was like, Oh, yeah, no, 100% Spanish. And they were like, Oh, I don't think they've ever actually really done that. So I see some Spanish leads came in. So we'll see. We'll see how those go.
00:43:13 - mark sweet
Definitely handle Spanish.
00:43:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, they were like, wait, what? go, yeah, which was surprising. I'm like, really, your other firms aren't bilingual. Okay.
00:43:23 - mark sweet
Do you have what else we could do in New Mexico? Because New Mexico is looking good for us. It's just the volume is low.
00:43:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, those guys are in New Mexico, but yeah, volume is low.
00:43:39 - mark sweet
And that just may be just the New Mexico thing.
00:43:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Just purely based off of population size.
00:43:49 - mark sweet
Although there's way more than 20 good collisions a month.
00:43:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:43:58 - mark sweet
Okay. Then you know, we've Yeah, so have we got any retainers there yet, cases? Nope. You got like two leads so far. I'm going to refer down, but that's it so far.
00:44:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
From where?
00:44:18 - mark sweet
Walker. It's a six month gap in treatment, so didn't want to screw down with it.
00:44:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:44:29 - mark sweet
But I've got three firms that I would consent stuff to there.
00:44:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Three firms you can send stuff to there in Missouri. Burns.
00:44:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They get referred out.
00:44:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:44:46 - mark sweet
I've got a place to put them if they're not for us. So at least I get some kind of money back, hopefully at some point.
00:44:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. That was, I was like, wait, are we talking doctors or?
00:44:56 - mark sweet
Okay. No, the doctor referral network is there and waiting for them to sort of send them. cases. But yeah, I'm not doing that.
00:45:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And is Monkey working on getting new leads there?
00:45:31 - mark sweet
Valium's been the main one, I want to say in New Mexico.
00:45:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I'm asking for Missouri.
00:45:38 - mark sweet
I think they said they were full.
00:45:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They do.
00:45:48 - mark sweet
But I can certainly ask them again. mean, got a decent relationship. Right. So, hey, we lost. Let me know if there's any additional volume.
00:46:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Okay. Um, is that anything Felipe can do?
00:46:11 - mark sweet
I'm trying to use them less and less to be frank with you because I just, their cost is just so high and it's just not great.
00:46:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you think there's any, do you think there's any possibility that that's different in Missouri?
00:46:32 - mark sweet
Um, I guess it's worth asking them.
00:46:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean, because you don't have to do anything that you could, you could ask all the right questions, you know. I'm a big fan of asking.
00:46:46 - mark sweet
Yeah, I'm going to text the morning.
00:46:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's see, oh yeah, I wanna write down. It's America that's building out that doctor map.
00:47:13 - mark sweet
Yeah, so we have the excel of it, now she's putting it into a map.
00:47:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that you showed it to us because I can visualize it now and it makes it so much easier to just be like, oh, okay, that's great. So when you said that ideally, well, really that your max would be like three to five visits or three to five doctors per visit, is a visit a day? Is it a week? How do you think?
00:47:50 - mark sweet
Yeah, because I really can't get through visiting more people than that in a day. Okay, give you hour, hour and a half for each doctor, plus usually at least 30 minute travel. time within each one. So, you know, I'm talking about give or take two hours and I don't want to rush necessarily.
00:48:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, right.
00:48:10 - mark sweet
Even if it's to five doctors, two hours, it's 10 hours and unfortunately sometimes it's tough to do a lot more than that.
00:48:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and also the diminishing returns of just the conversations you're going to have towards the end of the day and that could have been one of the better doctors, know, that having more energy would be better for it. know what I mean? Like there's there's probably a sweet spot in there where those are going well.
00:48:41 - mark sweet
So, five is okay. It's just when we're trying to do like seven or eight. It just it's too much crazy running around and we end up missing someone.
00:48:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, five well, then that's great. You're you're machine.
00:48:57 - mark sweet
Go out it like, you know, six in the morning.
00:49:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like it's a very long day, but it's only one day you're still young. You you have I don't but it's fine, but again, I'd rather do that than spend two or three days in the same place Okay, let's see New hires How's it going on trying to find a Seattle attorney?
00:49:27 - mark sweet
Uh, I think we might be giving up to be honest with you. Okay Because Most of our creators have said we spent way too much money trying to find one and you said no to everyone And every person we've interviewed so far has behind us So it seems like it's better for us to go and I find one of these older attorneys who for 100 bucks an hour we can just ask legal questions of just build out a person or two here so at least we'll get some of the legal brain drain that we need but we're just not finding the right person that is a strategy and it might be pretty cost-effective that's interesting you know again just we're not if we're not not finding the person and our big problem has been we don't necessarily know everything that we're doing talking to you know older slash semi-retired attorney at least he knows from the legal side yeah he's not going be as aggressive as we are whatever else but we can ask legal questions well not only that though if you establish relationship and they being local might hear through the grapevine when there is somebody that's good and then on your way like there's so many different
00:51:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
ways that can turn around something even better than just some good answers.
00:51:04 - mark sweet
Yeah, that shoots me.
00:51:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, and I think in that instance, then I would prioritize, obviously, the knowledge of the law and their willingness to just share that despite whether or not they agree with your strategy and then just the overall, I don't, it's not camaraderie. I can't, I don't know how to say it, but the openness, basically, that would allow you to establish a relationship that would be conducive to that kind of thing, you know, passing people on to you. It has to be something.
00:51:47 - mark sweet
Yeah, I don't know to build it to the law. I mean, again, they're semi-retired.
00:51:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, so you have a specific person? Right, that's true. No, no, I'm asking you. Do you have a specific person?
00:51:59 - mark sweet
Okay, that's- So they posted on the list or like, hey, I'm looking to do more mentorship. want to charge like a nominal amount in like a hundred bucks an hour. What do you guys think?
00:52:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Fascinating.
00:52:14 - mark sweet
So I'm going to chat to them and. We got emails them already.
00:52:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's that?
00:52:22 - mark sweet
I already have an email to him.
00:52:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Do you have a first name? So when I ask you, I don't want to say the guy.
00:52:30 - mark sweet
Curtin.
00:52:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What was his first name? John. Okay. Moving along.
00:52:42 - mark sweet
You know what? the Arizona.
00:52:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What might be.
00:52:47 - mark sweet
This guy, thought he was in Washington. Oh. But even still Arizona is the same idea.
00:52:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, you already have two attorneys here.
00:52:59 - mark sweet
Yeah, neither one. really knows what hell they're doing. Again, just having someone like an expert. Yeah, you can just, you know, talk to you and whatever else.
00:53:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I really like that strategy. It really speaks to more of what Dan has kept trying to push towards just leaning out, uh, out, leaning out, um, out. Yeah, I said it, but then I was thinking about like leaning to the side, but you knew what I meant anyway. Yeah. Okay, let's see. Einstein, AI, client breaking. Oh, that's, and that was the litify stuff.
00:53:47 - mark sweet
Wait, no, it wasn't. Notifies the sort of on some AI, but I still think we've got to build us out ourselves. And the reason for that is, uh, um the litify price is ridiculous oh yeah right the one like five dollars a file which is just oh yeah um so i think there's some there with Einstein uh Isaac's been out sick the last week or so oh also Isaac's been a child just FYI in November Isaac is i mean he's not the one physically but yay that's awesome congrats Isaac and is he taking paternity leave?
00:54:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
i don't know i need to ask him about that i don't think so because he's the main breadwinner but i'm not sure um so then what do we have any thoughts on how we would implement building something in house i mean it could be really minimal that's what i was hoping
00:55:00 - mark sweet
thing, maybe Dan and Josh kind of had, because I'm more than sure Josh is going to say the same thing of $5 a file is just dumb. Yeah, like there's no way they're going to pay that. And so maybe if we all kind of work on it together, we can find some of the all of us. But I would ask him like, Hey, did you see the pricing on it?
00:55:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Because I'm sure he has.
00:55:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, well, that's a start. So Dan, do you want to ask Josh about it? Mark, do you want to email Josh and Dan and like, how do we get this to move?
00:55:44 - mark sweet
don't really communicate with him too much. So I'll be better for Dan.
00:55:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dan, do you need a reminder for this? Nope. Okay, so the notes that I have regarding Einstein AI was client ranking, so I want to just make sure that I don't want to direct something wrong. So what would we want to be doing with the AI?
00:56:39 - mark sweet
So what we found solidified built out was taking a scan document and renaming it, being able to pull in information with their visual AI, whatever they're calling it. Einstein AI should be able to do the same thing, which again, is taking from scan to pull up and client name, data service, the data incident, the amount, and then being able to put that and create the fields within our data.
00:57:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, Dan, I am Kinging Stacey for a task for you with that information that Mark just gave.
00:57:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Don't up at 4 a.m. on Mondays anymore, okay? Okay. Well, now I'm talking to Eric about these themes.
00:57:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. forgot it was a doggy thing. Hopefully that gets regulated. Think couple months some Warren G out there to regulate All right Case that's good.
00:58:14 - mark sweet
So the money is gonna be here very shortly. So yay. it's great. Happy Upset about that But now it gets you tax planning yay.
00:58:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)

00:58:30 - mark sweet
Can I pay Tina for like a year ahead of time or six months at a time so I can take more money off Oh I can run that by my account especially if you pay especially wait how do I get ambax points off that when we can think of that? Yeah, I mean it might count shortly Okay, yeah, no that all makes sense Yep, I'm all for the em exponents make it make sense. That's all I say. I don't even know So for discount for paying up front, that's right.
00:59:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You wouldn't go in anyway. Oh, speaking of paying up front, why am I not charging you for lead flowy?
00:59:08 - mark sweet

00:59:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It stays as like, no, don't you have our fees integrated in? So I don't know how that happens.
00:59:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, everything is separate. Okay. like multiple everything. I'm the worst bookkeeper ever.

01:01:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's legit.
01:01:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And can it quit to quit?
01:01:15 - mark sweet
Another not quick, because it seems to generally work. So then, Dan, you and I need to find the time to talk to the hot people, because that's going to keep going on for a little while.
01:01:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I don't even really know what they do.
01:01:30 - mark sweet
So, yes. Okay.
01:01:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Let's put them over a barrel.
01:01:36 - mark sweet
I'm cool with that.
01:01:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:01:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, like Thursdays.
01:01:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Thursdays. Target a Thursday.
01:01:44 - mark sweet
Yeah.
01:01:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. I'll tell you, I'll look at my calendar that I don't use, and then tell you what my openings Don't be this Thursday because I got to cook for the office this Thursday again.
01:01:54 - mark sweet
Yeah, maybe pictures of that. It's just barbecue day.
01:02:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. And by cook, is this you opening take up barbecue from somewhere else and putting it on the grill and then putting it on a plate or is there going to be raw food involved?
01:02:10 - mark sweet
Virtually probably because now we have to like sit there and cook on one small grill.
01:02:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Mark's going to be like, I slaved over these are three day baked baked baked beans. I've been, I soaked the beans first, then I'd get out my amens.
01:02:22 - mark sweet
system we picked each and every one.
01:02:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yep.
01:02:24 - mark sweet
I grew these in my backyard.
01:02:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
All organic.
01:02:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like a Korean barbecue, Mark's going around with all these lungs.
01:02:35 - mark sweet
No, they want the Mexican stuff. want carne asada, oh yes.
01:02:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll probably cook some of it the night before and just reheat the next day. Yum. Well, I think I had a good breakfast or I'd be hungry and mad at you guys now.
01:02:54 - mark sweet
But it's always a matter of the general rule of thumb.
01:03:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
accurate.
01:03:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see, Dan wants Mark to get Patsy's hub valiant to show us inside. Oh, husband. Oh, yeah. My shorthand size. Uh, how's that? Um, can we? Patsy's husband.
01:03:23 - mark sweet
I always forget his name. It's Mary's, but that's okay.
01:03:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
01:03:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
My bad. Mary's somebody's husband.
01:03:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Mary has, what's his name?
01:03:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Don't know.
01:03:34 - mark sweet
Uh, Devin.
01:03:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Valiant. Oh, yes. In parentheses, I know, but I need all the different anchors in my brain so I can not combine things together to show us what he does. So who's trying to talk to him?
01:03:54 - mark sweet
Are you trying to talk to him, Dan? I just sent him a message, but Dan, no more, be under the hood.
01:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, What?
01:04:00 - mark sweet
Dan wants to be under the hood what he's doing.
01:04:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
he's making it work, which. Right. I mean, Dan getting sneak peeks at things is how Dan does like some crazy magic. So that would be cool. OK, I've gone through my list. We got that one task, everything else. And you're going to work on the intake script with those guys.
01:04:31 - mark sweet
I sent to you. Take a look at it. mean, maybe I'm being too harsh.
01:04:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, yeah, I mean, I just listened to the calls. And it was like the my takeaway from listening to the call was like, oh, my God, they waste so much time not. It's like it's like it's two things. The first section is like, should I even be on this call? Then it goes into a script, right? So it's almost like the. There's just like this qualification question or three that then would that then would turn into more of like what you were getting at where they're the rapport and the bump of fire, whatever. But I mean, I listened to a handful of calls and I was like, Oh my God, they're eight minutes in and the person's just recapping the accident that subsequently turned out. There was no injury. It's like, you got to get that out of the way up for impossible. Or it wasn't a car or it was like not even a car accident, right? There's a few of those.
01:05:33 - mark sweet
was like, Oh, yeah, was playing this. Uh, said tomorrow the one came today asked about Thursday. We'll find a time.
01:05:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay.
01:05:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so I have a question though. Yeah, you said you listened to calls. Did Mark send us calls or did you listen? Because I would love to hear how that goes.
01:05:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, you can. I can get you. They're in the lead flow. You can just go and listen to them.
01:06:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I spent six years at a call center, so learning how to kind of craft that with something that I spent a lot of time on. How can I get into lead flowing into this?
01:06:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, I'll add you as a user.
01:06:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, cool. Do you need a reminder?
01:06:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, I'm thinking, I don't know, I don't know if you, have you seen, have you used the new thing?
01:06:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have the paid chat, GPT, Tina?
01:06:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Doug.
01:06:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
As soon as it was optional, yeah.
01:06:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay, so have you used the thing where you create your own agent, so whenever?
01:06:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think I've created one, was playing with it, but I'm, no, I've played with the agents, but not.
01:06:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So now, yeah, there's like a new section where you could go in and like create an agent. Yeah, so I was, I messed with it with Eric and we created. So basically for lead flow, like some of the stuff that we did recently, you have to use these custom JavaScript elements and it was like. Okay, well we need to write JavaScript and then I was like, well, we could just make an agent that writes a JavaScript for us, right? And so first we had Chachi indeed just write JavaScript and it totally worked, like right out of the gate. We just had to figure out how to present it in the workflow or whatever, but ultimately the code was worked. We just had to tweak like two things. So now we've created this, the implementation there is what's called vanilla JavaScript. So it's like not using outside libraries. It's like straight JavaScript. So we created a vanilla JavaScript agent that we now just use. So all it does is work with us on JavaScript. So you could create an agent in GPT and call it like literally like an intake, legal intake agent. And it can listen to recordings that we could feed recordings into it and say, Hey, here's these recordings and then start to ask your questions like what and tell it what the goal is right and then see how are these calls line up against that goal or something like that that could be interesting yeah private server though right there's the turning client privilege issues are they a client yet there's a turning client privilege issues okay it's it's a self-contained yeah it's like your gpt or the account holder's gpt so it would be like if tina built it in her it would be in her gpt it's not publicly accessible okay so it basically has the same kind of privacy as like litify does it's on their server but you know it's it's protected by privacy laws in the same kind of way okay but first of almost just listen to calls.
01:09:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, for sure.
01:09:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Because the other thing is you could just take the transcript and be like, Hey, here are the, it would just be interesting to be able to know like, what is similar about the first three minutes of these calls without, right? It's like, are they, I don't know, find the same old table, like, what are the patterns? You can find the patterns, then you can deal with the patterns or, or, or overcome whatever. Yeah, I'll get, I'll get to your user and then you can just go start. You basically just sort by time and then you can listen to like the calls that have some bulk and then you get an idea.
01:09:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got it. I'll probably have questions too before I start listening. I can kind of zero in on what are the best types of calls. So I can get a good sampling.
01:09:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, the other crazy thing is that now you have like, this the AI agents the voice AI oh yeah so like imagine all your calls I'm not saying you do this right now but if you have a voice AI that acted as like acted as I'm just gonna say secretary but active like the first line in of every call goes to this same person and all their job is is to do that qualification piece have you been in an accident oh okay great let me let me put you in touch with and it could literally say Patsy and then it would try to transfer the call to Patsy like automatically you could definitely get to that in the very near future yeah which is still got some more I'm sure you saw like McDonald's stop doing it so the other ones it yeah you have to train the AI 100% well we're actually testing so we So, I don't think I've ever mentioned this before, initially we had going back to when we first started Leopler, where it's not a bot, but we had this text automation. We're like, hey, you're probably on your phone right now, going to try calling you. That's all just if then type , it's very linear in a way. There's some decision. Free stuff happening, but then we put in the AI bot. Just overnight, like, let's say we did two months ago, I forget how long ago we do it, but we compared the chat automation versus the AI bot and they're kind of neck and neck. So now we opened up the AI bot a little more to some of the other leads, but we're, we're going to go out and test this other AI bot. that's even more intelligent than what we had. So Eric's building that bot right now, but that service that we're using that we're testing, they actually doing voice AI as well, but I mess with that side of it. Yeah, we'll see.
01:12:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not working interesting. Are you from now? For I don't like to put dependencies on new technology that could be expensive if it failed. I like to play with new technology when it's just a playground and it's kind of sandbox and it can't hurt anything. But for this type of thing, because your front line is so important, I'd probably wait a few months at the very least, but if not more like a year until that's really honed out. Well, the other thing is, then they're becoming... comes a greater market awareness, more people are familiar, hey, there are AI agents, you know, we're talking to people and it just becomes a little bit more accepted and more mainstream so that you don't risk alienating people that may be like, oh, there's a pause in between every conversation. This is AI, you know, I don't know how many people know but those are just the things to think about as technology evolves and arises. I think that we're going to want to implement it. I think that it is the way to the most leveraged business but I think that the on-ramp should be slow. I'm a huge proponent of the technology and AI. love it but I think it has to have guardrails and I think certain types of it need to really be well refined than what other people be guinea pigs before we go. there and the front line of your business is definitely one of those places.
01:14:06 - mark sweet
It's cool. But yeah, I get what you're saying.
01:14:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, Dan has a rule of, you know, what would be cool is, yeah, I don't hate it. No, no, no, you know what cool, you know, what could be cool is bad. It's automatic red flag.
01:14:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's a yeah, that might be cool. But what would be cool is if you could burn more leads period.
01:14:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, which is, you know, we've got a good plan in place. So, oh, wait, the question was, my last question, Dan was, do you need a reminder to set me up an account so I can go listen to calls?
01:14:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I'll do right now because I'm already in there.
01:14:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yee-haw. And then Mark to follow up with you on Lorenz and Patrick, how would you Do you like to proceed?
01:15:01 - mark sweet
can email and we can talk to them and see what their schedules look like. And I'll just text you on the side and we'll figure it out.
01:15:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And also, if we're doing whatever the pay in full for the year, would rather that.
01:15:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh yeah, there you go. Because you paid differently. No, what do you mean? There you go. I have no idea what I'm talking about. Bill, I'm going to do that on task.
01:15:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Bill doesn't do me. Anyway, I don't know how you pay Dan, but he pays me through PayPal, and I'd rather not have PayPal take a huge chunk out of that. So I can send wire information or something.
01:15:42 - mark sweet
So I do for a bigger contract. to vote Dan and I like our points a lot.
01:15:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. That's right.
01:15:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's right. I do.
01:15:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
take fees too, but I can all take fees.
01:15:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think PayPal and Stripe are pretty much the same. right? I have no idea.
01:16:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. don't know.
01:16:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll go. Oh, I'll look and set up one thing for you. I don't know.
01:16:07 - mark sweet
just think they're sure.
01:16:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Anything else that we did not discuss that needs to be actioned or noted to be actioned and talked about next week?
01:16:20 - mark sweet
Monkey just got back to me that they don't have volume right now, but they might in the next month or two.
01:16:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, that's something.
01:16:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
All this honesty. They don't want to get. They're like, we don't want to get canned on what we're already doing.
01:16:38 - mark sweet
They're like, I mean, we got to be one of their bigger players at this point.
01:16:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and super consistent.
01:16:44 - mark sweet
Yeah. So yeah, I'm sure they want to try to make sure we stay happy. Okay. See where it goes.
01:16:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:16:52 - mark sweet
Okay. else? Nope. Okay.

Hi, Tina. Hi, how are you?
00:00:03 - Laura L
Oh, good yourself.
00:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good, except for I can't find. I don't remember the name of the high level account that I had because under my friend's domain, I think I shared it with you.
00:00:20 - Laura L
Yeah, you did. Let me shut its name. Okay. Okay.
00:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yes, thank you. That's how little I've been in it. I really wanted to be prepared and have things organized for you, but this is the thing. I'm starting to get to a point where, oh, I could stop my video. Sorry. uh where I can't do things by myself so much so I'm a business consultant and what I do for to earn my money for the most part is um I get on meetings with clients who pay me really well and I help them with their systems and their teams and their operations and their mindset and all kinds of things I take a really holistic approach to business so um I've been doing that for 22 years but um and everything I've done has been 100% word of mouth and I get paid really really well and it's been amazing and it's been a blessing um and I've been raising four children by myself for that same amount of time but now I in this background is relevant so that you understand just kind of like um a little bit about me and understand where um you know what you could offer what how you might be helpful and because I would really like, I think there's a potential for a great long term arrangement. But I think that it's helpful to understand the background. So two of my daughters are fully grown now and I've got a 17 year old and a 14 year old. And so I needed a lot less and the reason I chose the work that I did and the reason I got good at what I got good at was because I needed work to be very efficient. I needed business to be very efficient so that I had plenty of time to be mom. And because I got good at that, I was able to train it to other people and that's what they came you up for. But I only worked about 10 hours a week. And I mean, that's how good of a business it is that even in 10 hours a week, I could still take really good care of my family. So I'm good at what I do. But I need to work more because I'm a mama at heart. and without little kids at home to take care of, I really want to put it into business right now. And so I want to help more people, but because my business has always been 100% word of mouth, I can't just grow it. I don't have a marketing engine for it at all. I've never run ads for it, I've never needed to. And I've never had, I've never launched a course, but I really felt called because my approach is so different. You know, I'm not about the hustle and grind. I'm not about, you know, make as much money as you can, just because you can. It's really about using business to help you have a full fulfilling and happy life. And that looks different for everybody. Everybody's brains are different. Everybody's skills are different. Their finances are different. Their family time is different. You know what I mean? All these different things. And so I'm able to teach people. how to build there and optimize their business based on their own values and their own resources and things like that. So there's a couple things going on. One of the things is I'm working on building that course. I'm having somebody help kind of extract information for me. I'm using AI to help me just organize and take all of the stuff that I've been doing on repeat for 22 years. And productizing it so that I can offer it to people who can't afford $500 to $1,000 an hour to work with me. So that's part of it. And then the other thing is though I would like to also build a system that can help me find the higher level clients that I have and they are going to be know multi seven figure earners. I've got doctors, I've got lawyers, I've got market I've got copywriters, I've got, I've had property managers, I have lots of different types of people. So working on all of that and inside of that, because I've been working on building businesses with other people, and also because when I first got started, it wasn't as a consultant, it was, I did web design, I did graphic design, I did copywriting, I customized WordPress, I customized PHP scripts, I built automations, so I have a lot of the, I know that there's a lot of great things that we can do just to kind of build a really good engine and machine using technology, and I want to leverage all of that. But I don't want to be the one doing the work and thinking about that, I want to stay in my own lane of helping the business people do their job well. So when you said automations make your brain light up, That's awesome. That's so fun. And maybe it'll be something where you'll look at things and go, oh, I see we're doing it this way, you know, have you thought about doing this or incorporating that? And not necessarily immediately, but just thinking about what I would love is if I give you a task, if you have a thought about it, like I think, you know, have you thought about doing it that way, right? I think maybe this would be better or this is a potential problem I see.
00:06:35 - Laura L
Like I would really love to hear from you. Okay, I'm sort of a collaboration.
00:06:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I would really love that. That would be the most useful thing to me. I'm not afraid of making mistakes. I'm not afraid of wasting time. I'm not afraid of wasting money. The only thing I don't want to do is be stuck doing it by myself because then I'll just be like, I'm not going to get it done because I'm I am social, and I work socially, and I don't want to disappoint somebody working for me. if I tell you I'm going to do something, then I'm going to do it. If I can, you what I mean? So that really helps me be able to get my stuff done. So to begin with, I thought that maybe I could just kind of screen share and like walk you through some of my assets and show you what's existing and kind of tell you the framework of where I want to get started so that we can get some traction because I think if I build the house, then it will be easy for me to put the furniture in so to speak. create a membership area with the sections and then I'm like, okay great, here's the content for that section, that type of thing.
00:07:52 - Laura L
Make sense?
00:07:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. cool. So let me go ahead and screen share. I'm just like super
00:08:00 - Laura L
dehydrated all the sun. Is it sunny there?
00:08:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, well, no, be kind of the sun is going down. It'll be down in about 45 minutes.
00:08:12 - Laura L
I see. Well, it's really hard hearing the Philippines.
00:08:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's not fun.
00:08:18 - Laura L
Yeah.
00:08:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Talking to me, think about where they're at. I have a couple of these that are working for me in my Etsy shop. And let's see. Lee is in. I don't know where she's at. It's 11 a.m.
00:08:38 - Laura L
time. Yeah, I think we're at the same time.
00:08:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is all of the Philippines in the same time? Yeah. I mean, oh, I'm going to stop sharing just for a second. Well, it doesn't really matter. This is my ADHD brain. I go all over the place and but eventually we may all be in the Slack channel working together.
00:09:12 - Laura L
Hello.
00:09:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And okay, so I've got, well, that was what I was not showing. Profitriders Inc is my main website. I don't do anything with it. Like I said, everything is word of mouth. The only reason it exists, what is this? Is because sometimes people look me up and I just wanted to have a place where they could find some things that they look me up because I do do some podcasts, interviews with other people on their podcast. And I have had, this is terrible, this is terrible. I have had people 26 years business that's not well actually it's 28 yeah because I had six years in corporate. So that needs to be updated somebody else built this website for me so and it currently is hosted on Presidium have you heard of Presidium oh not yet okay so it's just a WordPress hosting service that is pretty quick um is it a page builder no well no it's not they but they do have it's just WordPress hosting so well actually let me go I don't want to go to the dashboard I want to go to Presidium.com as reliable secure managed work press hosting so
00:11:00 - Laura L
Okay.
00:11:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They do have great support and I do want to share that with you. So let me actually do this. Is that right? No, that's not what I want to do. I have, there's things that you can't see because it's not being shared but it's the zoom controls and they keep getting in the way. So, okay, share securely. Open. And I. Okay, so we'll share a procedure. So then you will have access to all of my current hosting. I don't Is that everything in there? All the sites. Okay, so these are the domains that I have that are hosted here. I'm not really using that. I do have something on. Hey, it's Tina Marie because I try lots of different things. I'm just going to show you. I really am all over the place. Oh, and what I did have is an existing anymore. So that's fun. I don't know how that happened. I had it. So that's something. If you, we could use either like a shared Google Doc or something. I don't know if you like project management suites, how you like to organize tasks that need to get done. I can use any of them, you know, Trello teamwork, we can use a Google Doc, we can, I prefer not email, Slack has a new thing where you can manage a project in there.
00:13:14 - Laura L
But, yeah.
00:13:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What would you, what would you prefer for getting assignments and keeping track of them? Do you have any preference?
00:13:22 - Laura L
Yeah, right now I'm using Trello, but it would be convenient for you to use like them.
00:13:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I could also do that. Okay, I do like Slack Trello is totally okay too, especially with the Canban boards where we can move things into in progress. Do you have something that you could share, or would you like me to set up an account and share it with you?
00:13:48 - Laura L
Yeah, I can do a set up the one so it would be easier, I mean convenient for you.
00:13:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, that would be great.
00:13:58 - Laura L
Maybe.
00:14:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We could just have boards like to do and then progress road block and completed something like that. That would be perfect.
00:14:09 - Laura L
Okay.
00:14:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
um, let's start with this. Okay. So profit drivers right now is hosted here. Now, I, I am going to use high level, but it's not great as a host. It's great for texting and automations, but not for hosting, but I am considering. So one of the things that I get blocked on a lot, Laura is where to host a membership site. I have a bad habit of overthinking things and wanting it to be really perfect in terms of a user experience. The biggest thing is what I would like to be able to do is. serve content that a person does not have to log in to see. So like if we send an email and say, hey, module one is ready for you, if they click that link, I would love it to automatically log them in. They don't have to put in a username and password, and they can just go see their content because every step where there's a roadblock of any sort reduces the likelihood that they're going to consume the content. And I want like everything about what I do is to create and make things as simple as possible for people so that they can get the most important things done. Are you familiar with anything that, because I think you can do that with entrepreneurs, but I'm not going to pay for entrepreneurs because that's it's crazy expensive, but are you familiar with any other platform or even if high level, if you. can if we can create links that automatically log people in so that if I email them a link, they can go straight to their content without logging in.
00:16:11 - Laura L
I could actually check because I'm not really that 100% sure yet for a high level, but other than that I tried cartra, but it would be also the same with on-chip port. It's pretty expensive. So yeah, I could go ahead and look at go high level if there's that dynamic URL that they would take you to the content right away.
00:16:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and I would love because the one thing I know about high level is first of all, they have like Frankenstein code. They purchased their code from all kinds of different sources and kind of pieced it together, but they keep working on it and they keep evolving it and they evolve it quickly. And so if we put that in as a feature request, that might be something that it could actually provide. very quickly. So I would love it if you would take it obviously billable time and see and talk to their support and find out if that's something that's an option. And if not then finding out like there's searchy.io there's circle there's all these other platforms that are just content based sorry my dog is just barking her head off. And we could put it anywhere. I do want it to be simple. The biggest thing I think is that I want it to be simple access. So there's also school. I'm not a fan of it but but I really need to get over myself. So one of the things that would be super amazing for me from you and I shouldn't need it because I'm 47 years old and I should know better. But I need encouragement. I just need to hear this is going to be okay. We'll make it work. People will like it. it, that type of thing. It's, it seems like a really silly thing. But honestly, I can almost cry right now. Like, that's just, that's ridiculous. But that's, that's what my roadblock is. There's nobody that does that in my business. I do that for people all day long. So if that was something you felt comfortable doing with, that would be amazing to me. And you would be invaluable. So they're sad. Great tip. Yeah, yeah. and one of the things about just hiring you is that I, when I looked at your, your reviews and the feedback that people left you and I saw how long you, you worked, I feel like your person that enjoys being a part of a team and enjoys the work that you do and is very supportive. So, but also you, you are smart. You articulate. You really take a lot of boxes. So I, I'm really looking forward to this and I would just want to encourage you to just use this place with me to explore things maybe that you don't feel like you get to with other people because one of my favorite things is to see people grow their most like I don't have ego it's not a hey you work for me lady kind of thing it's not like that you know I might pay the bill but you do something for me that I can't or won't do for myself so I have tremendous value for you already and if there's a way that I can be supportive to you in your growth or even just allowing you to experiment with things let me know because I love I love being able to offer that to people well honestly I really love this kind of opportunity the first I met you when you shared your story because I actually planning to then sort out like a
00:20:00 - Laura L
the aid services here in the Philippines, the people here like my colleagues are struggling, finding jobs as they want to experience the same thing as my experience, like working from home and not missing out the milestone of my kids. So I'm kind of wanted to make this work out so I could also help them. I want to share the blessing of, you know, having the opportunity to take care of the kids at the same time earning.
00:20:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yes. Yes, I would be happy to help you in any way with that. Helping grow and start businesses is my area of expertise. cheapest client pays me $500 an hour to do it. So I'm good at it and I, but I do it for free. I sometimes just donate services. and help people because I really do love what I do and I feel like it's my calling. So if like sometimes if we just want to have a call about what you're doing and just work on that, I'll just give that to you.
00:21:14 - Laura L
Well, I'm still struggling though of finding my calling yet, but yeah, I'm actually trying to taking the time to really find it.
00:21:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah, it is. I feel like, especially as a mom, it took me a really long time to be clear about things and be clear about what is and what is not for me. And a lot of times what became clearer first was what is not for me. So it was easier for me to find what is for me by finding out what wasn't. Because there's so many things that can be, you know what I mean, but by finding out the things that they're not for me either because they aren't compatible with me. my values or with my faith and or with being a mom. I'm not compatible with the schedule or like a lot of the reasons I don't do marketing is because so many women, they use their bodies and they draw attention in a way that I never wanted to do. And it's not about judging them, it's just it's not what I wanted to do. And so that was what I was like, okay, that's not for me. So, you know, it was it was a lot of that. But what I found is that every time I would get excited and want to do something, it would be like, God is like, okay, you get to do that, but not yet. Right now, I need you to take care of babies and I need you to be available for them and just be patient and your time will come, but you want it to be mom. So, you know, there's this. And so it's been really fascinating to go through that. I've been a mom for 23 years. And now I am almost almost like all my babies my my baby is going to be 15 in November.
00:23:05 - Laura L
So she's almost young. is 15.
00:23:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She'll be 15 in November.
00:23:10 - Laura L
She's 14 right now. Okay. Well, that's so fast, right?
00:23:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yeah, they are all growing up. And I'm a grandmother.
00:23:22 - Laura L
I'm about to have my second grandbaby.
00:23:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
00:23:25 - Laura L
Yeah. So this is what? 23. Oh, wow. So you already have two grandchildren.
00:23:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, she's 20. She'll be 24 in December. And she's not even the one that's a mom. It's the the one under her who's 22.
00:23:42 - Laura L
I see. Yeah. Well, I also get pregnant when I was 24 and my eldest is now 11. It's like a 10 year gap between my eldest and my baby now, which is one year old.
00:23:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, wow. That's awesome. I have there's a nine year gap between my oldest and my youngest. my youngest was born in 2000 when I was 24 and my one of my oldest and then my youngest was born in 2009. So they're nine years apart, but then there's two little ones in between. How fun. Okay, so the first assignment then is to set up the Trello account for us. Okay, the second assignment would be to find out if we can get a login less, basically access to membership content where somebody can just click in the email and access their content without having to click a login to any thing. Okay, so that's the second one and then after that it would be to To take a look at this site and see if there's anything that you notice needs fixing like that formatting is terrible, terrible, terrible. I hate my pictures, but people want to see faces, whatever. don't Want any branding guide. I don't. I've never done that. And if, but I do clearly obviously have colors. I really don't care about them, but I have them. That's the blue, the green and the orange, this, this blue. This is a dark blue in here. It's not black. It's actually a navy in the orange. So there's these four colors. I do have it in Canva. I do have my fonts there. So I kind of do. Let me show you my canvas. I think I also have a slot for another team number. don't know if that's even relevant, but. um profit drivers and wait our out brand kits that's it yeah so my logo's in there um the i don't know what this maybe the color that you have in the website but well it was something i was thinking about after 2020 that's a look at that okay anyway so um yeah logos uh let's see fonts title i think that's right um one test rod i'm not sure actually what this font is i thought it was railway i'm not sure what it is um but i don't really use it anywhere else and um do with this open sand cutting, yeah, I'm not sure I could find that. If it's needed for anything, the other thing is I do actually have a what do you call it. icon a favicon, but this is not using the right one and I don't know if it's in here, but I do have that so I would like it to be using the correct favicon. And so that could be a task as well, and then making sure that these forms work. So another thing that I would want to share with you is get response because that is the CRM basically that I have the email service provider to. And. Where's my code in here. If I can find it. I have nothing getting codes, wait where did it go, did it go to my email, so it to my email. I have a brain, it's just sleepy. Okay, there we go. didn't even need to do to share this with you, but I should do that. Share with Laura.
00:28:38 - Laura L
Hello real. Yeah, that's.
00:28:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, um, I don't know which one it is actually connected to. It might be 10 ways to 10k. Yeah. I drive no traffic to it, but it still gets traffic. One of the things I would like to have is Google Analytics, working, GA4, are you familiar with it? Yes. Great. Because I was having problems getting it integrated, I may have it, I may not, so another thing would be analytics.google.com. If I could add you here, would it be the same email address?
00:29:44 - Laura L
Yeah.
00:29:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So. I've got drivers. Um, I've never been very good at navigating this. Like, I don't know where to go to add you. So I would like to add you to everything that I have, but you could, I probably set up other properties and if you get stuck somewhere and just tell me, look, I need you to add me to something.
00:30:11 - Laura L
Yeah, I think it's an admin setting. At the bottom where there's a. Yes.
00:30:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. Set up these. Count details and access management.
00:30:26 - Laura L
Yep.
00:30:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Add users. Oh, Laura.
00:30:33 - Laura L
Laura. Yep, two, five, eight. That's you know, yeah. I think you also have to add the role.
00:30:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I'll just add you as administrators, but you can just have full. Okay. And then that. So. So then another assignment is just to check to see that GA4 is installed, it's collecting data, set up correctly, that kind of thing. checking the forms, checking the form matting on the home page, that is weird.
00:31:21 - Laura L
Are you not using Google Tag Manager or just the analytics?
00:31:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm probably not. I 100% neglect everything in my business, other than my clients.
00:31:34 - Laura L
You can assume it's not done or not done right. Maybe we could use the Google Tag Manager because we could also put all the tracking in there and yes please.
00:31:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It all in one place? Yes. I love analytics. It's been a while since I've looked at it because basically since it went to GA4 we've all been like what the heck is going on. And I don't spend a lot of time in it. I spend most of my time doing all kinds of other things in the business, but I used to be very familiar with analytics. I would look at heat maps. I want to know the conversions. I want to know the metrics. I want to know my balance rate. want to know my speed, the page loads speed. want to know all of that because that has an impact on how long people stay on the site. I want to know what they're engaging with. I want to know what's turning them off. So analytics is really important to me, but I'm never going to be the one to do anything other than pay for somebody to do it well because I've got too many other things in my brain. And it's another reason I'm really excited for you because I feel like you're going to be super helpful.
00:32:48 - Laura L
Yeah, that's also the problem for me because I feel like I kind of have that general thing like by actions, like, yeah, say they would want this. You know, I could like do and do that stuff because I also really love learning at the same way.
00:33:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. mean, it's like the best teacher. Yes. I am the same way. I'm a nerd. And if I have a question, I'll spend five hours learning about it and become an expert.
00:33:19 - Laura L
And even if I never do it ever again.
00:33:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I don't know a lot about it.
00:33:25 - Laura L
And if you ask a question, I could teach it to you. Yeah. Yeah.
00:33:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
okay. So I feel like that is a few things to get started on that will be at least probably five hours. If you run into a block and you need more time, we can do that. It's not urgent, like, I'm never going to be like, this has to be done really quickly for the most part. But I would like to go kind of quickly to get things at least to a baseline, a membership site where I can put content. tend to. So the priority, this is one of the things we should always do on our calls to, is decide, okay, of all the things that need to get done, what's the order of priority, what first, what second, what last, and so on. That way, I know that the thing that was important, that was most important to me is getting worked on. So if something doesn't get done, it's not going to be the most important thing, and that will be really great. So the priority really for me would be to make a decision about a membership site where I can start putting content in, and then the second thing would be analytics, but you have to decide is the website, like, do you know enough? Do you need to dig into the hosting a little bit, know, make sure that certain plugins are there, whatever, like, so that's up to you in terms of what you feel like you need to do for a baseline of making sure that the site is workable for you, make your suggestions. about we should have these plugins, we should not have these plugins, whatever. Yeah, so do you feel like that's kind of a clear starting point, especially with getting the Trello would be like step one, obviously, so that I can look at it and go, okay, here's the list of tasks that you captured. Yes, that's right. Then I can drag them, you know, in order of priority, if I change my mind or something, but the top of it right now would be membership site, second would be analytics, and then the other thing was just, you know, cleaning things up and then checking the forms, making sure that they work. So that's a good starting point, you think?
00:35:44 - Laura L
Yes, it is.
00:35:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Great. Good.
00:35:47 - Laura L
I'm so excited. Ah, really? Me too, really excited to get started. And also for the members should site just to clarify that would be hosted in Go High. I level so just only the membership it could be.
00:36:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know where I'm going to host it yet. If go high level can work in a way where it's really easy for people to access and they don't have to log in then I would host it there. If not, I want to look at some other options and see if there's a way for no login access. Do you know what mean? Like there's an automatic like the the URL is pre-coded for them to log them in. So that could be the second step. If it can't be go high level, is there another option that does pre-coded that isn't a CRM like on support or cartra but is a is purposefully like a membership service like Circle or Searchy or School or any of those types of things.
00:36:52 - Laura L
So I mean how do I let this govern maybe thinkific or yes yes yes anything that will do it.
00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm happy to pay for your research time because I do it and then I get frustrated and then I start overthinking things and I go down rabbit holes and I've wasted time and then I'm frustrated that I've wasted time. So yes, if you would do that, I will pay for the research time and then if you would make your recommendation and give me the data so I can make a decision but with your help, that would be amazing and then we'll just make a decision and then go with the best thing that we can that's also cost-effective.
00:37:36 - Laura L
Okay, yep, we'll do.
00:37:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, do you have other questions?
00:37:41 - Laura L
Yeah, I'll do it now.
00:37:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yay, I'm so like I feel relieved, I feel excited and also I love that you want to build something. know that that'll take a little while to do but if you wanted to like right out what you envision and then what I really start with Laura is I just ask people questions and as I ask the questions sometimes they don't have the answers and they're like oh I never thought about that let me you know and so it starts to kind of take shape and and it goes from there and it seems it's a it's really a simple process but it's as you know I'm sure it's just so much easier when somebody else puts their brain on it and looks at your blind spots or even maybe just encourages you and says you know what it's actually not as complicated as you think it is you could just do this or you could just do that so I would if you have a google doc and you start writing things down we could spend a few minutes and it would be you know off the clock obviously but I could give you some time every week to help you with that if you'd like well that's but I'm kind of really privileged to have you doing that for me because you know you're too busy and yeah it would be my pleasure it would be my pleasure honestly it's it's a great service and and one of my passions and missions is helping moms find work i've been so blessed i don't want to cry i've been so blessed to be able to stay home with my daughters and they have no idea that like they just think that this is life that moms can have time and they can have money and they can be there for everything and i'm like that is not what it's normally like whether they're married or not but definitely not for single moms and they don't know because that's the life that they had and i just think what a blessing that's been and i want to share that with as many moms as possible and what you're doing is a great way for me to be able to just add um add to i don't have to be the one in charge it doesn't have to be my thing i yeah because that's also the pain points that i'm seeing with all the
00:40:00 - Laura L
colleagues and friends that asking me what are you doing and then they could they would say I wish I could also what you're doing something like that so yeah that's also what I'm trying to I actually pray that I could also help them yeah yeah my thing that I ran into that was really hard is that people would ask me what I'm doing and then I would tell them and they wouldn't do the work yeah I would tell them all you have to do is like go apply to Upwork or go do this and like it's not fun sometimes to go right right for somebody else or to learn a new skill and you're not getting paid a lot of money but like you don't get to the good stuff quickly you have to work your way up and nobody wanted to do it like almost nobody this whole time 22 years Laura not one person actually followed through not one yeah that's it So the problem there is you wanted to help them, but they also not helping themselves.
00:41:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:41:06 - Laura L
I think they are what they're saying is that they are afraid of talking to clients. think the advice that I give to them is just be yourself. And then yeah, I think the client could see or could feel that if you are talking, I mean, you're from the heart and just honest of what the things that you can do and what are the things that you are willing to do like learn.
00:41:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and the other thing is I teach people, I mean, you can be afraid people want to avoid pain. And that's not that doesn't work because things are going to be hard and things are going to hurt. What you need to learn is that you can get over the pain quickly and the hurt won't destroy you, but it will teach you and it will be hard, but you'll be smarter because of it. And you'll be stronger because of it. And then you'll have amazing blessings because of it. And the other thing is, like if we were working with somebody that believes in God or as we're commanded fear not. We're commanded. not. It's not a suggestion. Fear not. Because God will help us. And so, like we don't have to be afraid of the hard things. We need to be willing to do the hard things. a lot of people just aren't. But sometimes maybe they just need to be encouraged. It's okay. some things are going to go wrong. And you're going to have some bad experiences, but you can't have the good ones if you don't try, you know?
00:42:39 - Laura L
Yeah, they're afraid. Oh, I mean, they are afraid to try.
00:42:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the thing. Yeah. And you can't fix that. But you can at least make a place and you can have some content that trains them and encourages them. And you can you can at least make make a space for them. if they choose it, they do and somebody will choose it. Somebody. definitely will choose it. Maybe not the ones that you want it to be, maybe not the friends that you care about. But somebody else will and it will bring you joy to know that you've helped another mom and another family.
00:43:13 - Laura L
Yeah, that's my prayer. hope that, yeah, it will come true.
00:43:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Speaking of family, there's a child. Yes. Yes. I am, but I'm almost done. Do you want to wait like a second? She's like, she's barbecuing for us right now.
00:43:31 - Laura L
She's making hamburgers outside on the grow. Oh, okay. need to go, yeah, go with your children and enjoy the barbecue.
00:43:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So if you have any questions, you can send them through Upwork. If it's complicated, and you want to make like a screen share, a loom video or something, then that works. then we can have these meetings regularly. If it's something complicated and you just want a separate meeting, we can do that. I'm really flexible with whatever is needed, and I'm just so excited.
00:44:07 - Laura L
I'm so excited. Yeah, me too. I'm really excited.
00:44:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yay! Okay, I'm gonna go take care of my daughter, and I hope you have an amazing afternoon, and I'm just looking forward to this.
00:44:20 - Laura L
Thank you, Tina. Yeah, I'll just go ahead and create the trailer board and then, yeah, send the link to you then.
00:44:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Thank you so much.
00:44:32 - Laura L
Thanks, Tina. Have a great day. You too. Bye. Alright, see ya.

I gotta go back to your emails. had them open and then I lost them. Okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I was definitely on the it's not. So in terms of just looking at your stuff. For me, the thing that always to look at is just just awareness. So, there's lots of things that make an impact on sleep. Think about what they are, notice them from time to time. If things aren't the way that you want to, try and change the things that do make a difference on sleep just biologically for everyone, see if it helps, but I think the biggest things that you've noticed is that getting enough sleep makes a huge difference for you. You did take a nap a couple times and you're, let's see, trying to remember what happened with that.
00:02:39 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't think I had any apps, did I?
00:02:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
might have been the macros I was thinking about, because anyway- Oh yeah, I saved this. Yeah, so anyway, yeah, paying attention to that, we don't, we don't have to go into that, but all of the practices. is and again with the holistic approach is because your business runs on you and you run on sleep and you trip in and everything else so do pay attention to it do what you can but the other thing was being obsessive about it doesn't do well so it almost seems like i'm being contradictory because we dug into it too much there's a difference with how much weight you give something mentally so i look at it but i don't think about it the rest of time i look at it and go huh maybe i'll try this put it in an experiment and then i'm not thinking about it anymore i don't worry about it so and knowing that you can make adjustments throughout the week like you did that with ester ester was giving you extra time to sleep in right so that was something that you did I do think that macros didn't make a little difference, but that's okay. If it doesn't just pay attention to those things, we don't need to talk about them. If you have any, you just like notice things are bad, rough, whatever, just see if anybody else has any ideas. if I have ideas, that's fine, but I love the business stuff too. But the holistic approach is always just, how are you? How are you taking care of yourself? Are you taking care of yourself? Do you are, you know, that's it. So it's a small conversation, a little bit every week, and I'll ask you that, are you taking care of yourself? How are you doing? Have you been feeling? That's important. The details can be up to you, but what happens sometimes is I'll catch up. Like when you got on the call today, there was an exhale, and that could have just been nothing, or it could be just, there's a lot going on, and I'm just trying to get focused.
00:04:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
so as I get to know you a little bit better, I'll run back from an open house. So I was trying to rush in the
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
door to make the meeting see there's lots of little things so I'll ask about it because I just want to make sure because we don't usually have people taking care of us in our business now you have your wife taking care of you but seeing how that correlation is to the business and also she's going through so much right now she needs to be taken care of so that's that's just kind of part of it so it's it was a getting to know you all these things love it all right so did you happen to notice any correlation with movements to sleep at all uh it's hard not I I really don't know I mean yeah yeah yeah I for me I can make the correlations but because there's so many guardables it's almost always that some things are good one day but the other things are bad yeah so and that's again why knowing what things make it difference because some things will be bad. But if I can get the other things in, for example, if I just was super stressed out or whatever, and I didn't get a lot of movement, I just walk, I pace my house. And I sleep a little bit better. get to sleep better. I digest better. Blah blah blah. Anyway, okay. So you got all the reports done. Yeah? Yeah. That felt good.
00:06:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And you're down and here's happy with you. Yeah. And well, we'll see he hasn't responded. I texted him. I said, he sent you all the reports. He said, okay, I'll look over him find you didn't he changes. I'll let you know. So I'll feed those into the model when they come.
00:06:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like you said somebody was happy with you about it though.
00:06:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, my manager, Nicole. That's what I said and your manager, right?
00:06:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah.
00:06:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. She was happy.
00:06:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:06:52 - Fujinaka, M.D.
She's been bugging me. She messages me every three days.
00:06:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And we're not going to let those stop pile anymore unless he gets Oh, about it.
00:07:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, that was fun though, because I could I could I want to try to keep training in the model now that I know I'm getting closer with it.
00:07:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Okay, so let me where's my notes, I have them open. I am tabzilla over here. Um, I'm going back and forth. Actually, I just need to keep multiple windows open with your message and my notes. Spending any time on Delta. And you got her, let's see. um, it's Esther's manager. What's her first name just so I can instead of saying Esther manager, I can say a name, one word.
00:07:51 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, it's Nicole.
00:07:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's Nicole. Okay. So you have the confidentiality and trade sequence.
00:07:58 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, that's her. Yeah, actually, uh, last. Yeah, I emailed her, talked to her and I messaged her again, and yeah, this is reminded of her, know, and then I then I told her how to do the, the requests for Q and E that requests for Q and E numbers. So yeah, she hopefully she'll get on that.
00:08:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. Did you give her a due date for requesting them this time so we can get them soon?
00:08:24 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I was gonna have, I was gonna have a wait till September 1st.
00:08:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so when do you think that we'll have the most recent reports?
00:08:37 - Fujinaka, M.D.
They usually take about seven days, so if you request sit on September 1st, then maybe about September 10th, do want to get it?
00:08:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:08:47 - Fujinaka, M.D.
They're the state, they're like DMV.
00:09:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then she's going to request them on the first, or roughly that every month.
00:09:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. I also had her send me a brief. Extra night of brief email about how many upcoming visits we have and how many visits we had the previous month. So I'll start having her check that and giving us reports so we can see how we did the previous month and how we're looking at how many appointments we have booked for the coming month.
00:09:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's awesome. And did you ask yourself why you haven't done that yet before?
00:09:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, no, just that I, you know, I do it sporadically, but I never had a system that to watch that. So now you're going to do that. Yes. Good. Now, because I was sending you the numbers and I know that I know the cash flow coming in and you know I can watch that weekly how much cash comes in. into the account but I don't know but I don't know how like my current month is or the month before was.
00:10:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right it's great because when you when you watch those patterns it gives more certainty so sometimes it can alleviate stress but also like if you have it and just think oh I'm not doing well but the other thing the other potential issue is complacency and apathy about it and just like do the thing and then you realize that there's a pattern of a little less a little less a little less and it's much harder to try to correct what's happening you know when you're not watching it so and it's very it's so much easier to maintain than to catch up.
00:10:45 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Sure that makes a second believe that. I kind of want to put it on the manager a little at the end because I was listening to I am I did leave a little bit to kind of power her, I said, hey, what, what, tell me also give me one sentence, what do you see in this trend, and what do you think, if anything, we should recommend what we should do. So I do want to put it on her because she's supposed to take everything off Esther's plate, manage the whole business, that part of it. So I did kind of put that in there to send me a little sentence or two every month about what she sees in our numbers, because if my numbers drop off, she's not going to have a job, right? If something has to get cut, Esther's going to come back to work, we're not going to need a manager anymore, you know, we're going to tighten ships. So it's in her best interest as well to like make sure my numbers stay popular.
00:11:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Love that.
00:11:45 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So we'll do that.
00:11:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Amazing job delegating, very, very good.
00:11:52 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Now that I think about it, maybe I should just have her since she's actually in the county, maybe she should just put this into a spreadsheet.
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. of everything that you have. So, then the other thing is potentially you might want like kind of like a dashboard workbook. So with Google Sheets, just like Excel, you can pull data in from multiple sheets and documents or because sometimes if you put too much data, they get big, they take too long to open. So pulling from multiple ones might be the thing to do, but either way, whatever, you want to have all the pertinent information in one source as often as possible like a snapshot slash dashboard so that it's very easy for you to be very mindful about where everything is and it's also very easy for you to track and make sure that whoever is responsible for getting the data is doing it because you have one thing to look at and is everything populated. So... Let's see, um, KPIs are, um, how many appointments coming in? how many get canceled would be a good one. So what else are you tracking that matters to you that, you know, a difference in your business? Thank you, Mise.
00:13:27 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Um, yeah, so there are initial consults where I see them the first time and and reevaluations where I see them subsequent times. So I want to make sure that I'm getting enough initial consults. So I actually told her to split the report. Tell me how many initials new patients I get because that tells me how I'm going to be how I am doing. And then how many follow ups I get follow ups just tell me, you know, what's the kind of the reoccurring business, but it's the new. all the time that comes in. So I did have her split that report up like that. That's really the biggest thing that we're that I'm tracking on the health of the business. Everything else is pretty constant that costs for the schedulers, the cost for, we pay someone to pre-call the patients so that I don't have to talk to them so long. The cost for the story to pre-call and we pay someone to summarize my records for me. So they take all the raw records, all the Kaiser records, and condense it into 100 pages. like all those things are pretty constant. So it's really just how much inflow we have that determines our number.
00:14:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so everything is referred to you, right? Yep.
00:14:53 - Fujinaka, M.D.
by attorneys, only I feel like you said that there was another source.
00:15:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, this, is it's a lottery pick based on what I write, write, sorry, I want to go, I, I will probably for a while mean go live medical with me. Yeah. Okay, so that's the lottery. And that's why we want the report so that we can try to get that now. I mean, it's 100% a lottery, right? They don't remove anybody that got something last month and we don't know.
00:15:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We just we think that like they don't tell you how it's done, but they tell you it's by zip code and and your proximity to that zip code. But we have tried putting like two names, like we put myself in two zip codes to see if it doubles my count. It doesn't really double it. So we think there's more to the algorithm than just, you know, zip code.
00:15:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know if they don't share that with us.
00:15:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We're not. You did explain that before, but again, there's a lot to kind of memorize about how the business works. It's a very niche area.
00:16:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For sure. Okay.
00:16:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Thankful for the very profitable for us for the time I spent on it.
00:16:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you can only be in 10 cities at a time, right? And you have that max out. We're going to get that reports where we can do some numbers. Is it possible to get a retroactive? So when they send you the reports, is it for the month or do they send you the whole year? Do they send it broken down by months?
00:16:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, what do I to call what I want to call this? I'm just having her send it month by month.
00:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because what would be really interesting is to see some historical data over like the past two years month by month plotted to see if there's any kind of variation or any kind of pattern to observe by location.
00:17:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, we have all the data. We have it all. It's created a sales force, a custom sales force.
00:17:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no, I mean, the, the, the, so how many incidents, how many doctors over time.
00:17:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah. Don't give it to you.
00:17:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You just have to request it from the state. So when she requested, can you request that so we can have so we can look at the, if there's any, any kind of patterns that might pop out in terms of is everything pretty consistent. Is there any kind of big jump, whatever.
00:17:51 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So kind of like a month, a month by month. Over the last two over the last year.
00:18:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
something right so by how many incidents and how many doctors and the population I'm sure the population doesn't change a lot but we don't want to make any assumptions so there are so many zip codes and there are you know development areas what do we not know that most people are never going to dig into and this may seem like not a big deal but like when we so I'll give an example for sweet law that I feel is totally appropriate and uh you're not going to go tell me maybe it's not appropriate I don't know I have to think about this just operations-wise but basically what we did and I can make it generic enough that it won't matter is that we looked at a few different things that impacted the business um like where where things come from where the leads come from um states things like that and what we noticed is that we have a dependency tea upon a couple of things and didn't seem to have a lot of ability to increase those. But we just put some effort into that and it created some leverage to show where a couple of things dropped off that would have cost us the business like just put us in a horrible situation. We had mitigated that by knowing what the data was and manipulating it to the best of our abilities and it ended up making all the difference in the world. For example, because you are able to move locations easily, just kind of get a satellite office, whatever. If we happen to see that there is some shifting happening, you could do that. I know location that's just exploding right now. but for whatever reason, no doctors are increasing there or it's not increasing at a proportionate rate. And maybe that's only going to be for a short amount of time before somebody gets there. That short amount of time could be a year and half, so it takes you six months to get there. You have a year there kind of dominating the area because nobody else noticed.
00:20:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'll add that to Nicole's thing. She's going to send me that when she first requests this, she's going to send me a draft of the email.
00:20:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So to that email, I'll add, I'll tell them, I want to separate Excel tab for each of the previous months as well, going back, I'll even go back six months over the beginning of 2024. Plus, I would imagine that there's a correlation between construction and accidents.
00:20:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't know. I don't know. It's by zip code, so.
00:20:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, so like if there's a development and there's just a lot of popular development happening in a particular location, which if a developer invests, that would happen. Anyway, I don't know. But looking at the data is how it helps us to figure out is there anything that we can really do about it. So if there's not, do you have the option of getting another doctor that works for you, that is that a possibility that it's completely separate other business, but that you hold the purse strings and.
00:21:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, so the way the business works right now is 100, you know, 100% of the money comes in, so 2000 a report. And then I pay me personally, and the doctor pays 40% to be 46. B46 is the billing and collection company that Esther owns. Okay. So our former company called Ava used to be that collection company. We actually had 15 of my friends. I recruited them in the. that. And so we were doing revenue of about 750,000 a month to that company. And that's the one that our partner was a and we closed it because we're like, we don't care how much we make, it's not worth being a business for that guy. So we actually came. was tricky legally because we didn't want to get sued for, you know, essentially closing a business starting a new one. But that's what we did. closed the old one, started a new one with just me and one of my friends who's my oldest friend. So we could argue in court that, well, I knew this guy before Ava, before we closed it, he's my long friend. That's why he came to our new billing company. So our current billing company has me and one of the QME that we make that Esther's company, B46, makes the 40% from. But yeah, it's always a quite, we were thinking like Esther thought, do we want to expand again? Maybe we can't I take the same 15 doctors because of non-competes, but we could go out and recruit 15 or however many new doctors to get that remedy. But right now, we're in a good place in our life, and it's pretty simple with just me and the other doctor for her and our manager. If we were to increase or double the size of that doctorable, we would have to increase the number. Scheduler has increased the number of editors, historians. The whole operation becomes more difficult with each doctor and astronaut just made the decision work. Right now, anyway, we're not going to expand, but yeah, you're absolutely right, your sense system. That is a way you can expand is get other doctor, private doctors to work for our building company, and we take 40% of their cut. We take a cut of 40%.
00:23:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, is that something that you think about? This is not the season of life, but you want to do it? I just want to understand what all the goals and the values are. are because I love that you guys have put a limit on and understood what happens if you scale up the burden of management. I think her having her company that she does really is a great kind of partnership because understanding that a lot of people just don't take that into account. They don't think about how much work it is to manage that increase. But it's a lot. And everything is a trade-off and sometimes that trade-off is just not worth it.
00:24:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So I love that you guys have thought about that. Yeah, we think that, you know, we increased back if we built back up to 15 and we're doing revenue, you know, that revenue. have ways we think we would have been more profitable. Like we we we've now outsourced 50 percent of her workforce. So we have three W-2 U.S. employees, which are incredibly expensive, right? like 7,000 a month. And then on the backside, actually have three Filipino that are... the cost of one US workers. So, you know, if we redid this, we know how we would scale it in the future. But, you know, the profit margins weren't as impressive. Like, you think, oh, you know, this guy makes 15,000, you see seven patients, he makes 14,000 of revenue in one day. 40% of that comes to our business. Well, we were actually only seeing like profits of our cut. We were only seeing like less like 5% profit maybe. And that was because we had an entire US workforce. So, we think that when we did a Filipino workforce, we could probably get closer to like 20% profit margin. But, you know, much is that for the amount of work? Because now your operation is just ridiculous. And is that that much money for that amount of work? So, that's the other thing we're balancing. Like, it's just, we, you think it's really profitable because it's like, holy cow, you know, 40% of $2,000, to schedule this. doctors visit but yeah the profit margins just weren't that high and I've talked to other owners of building companies and they say the same thing yeah our profits are like 20 percent and or yeah or 8 percent other one says 8 percent so yeah that's the other reason we're just like you know we could wrap back up to the 15 doctors but you know is that is it worth it for that amount operational headache right um maybe one day I'm not sure right okay so let me make sure that I I write this and keep asking that question yeah we've thought about it quite a lot because it's so yeah we I mean you know from a recruitment standpoint I don't think I'd have trouble bringing in other trends to do this it's such a lucrative gig but yeah I mean there's just a lot how do you get to it's so lucrative and then it's five percent so like
00:27:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For the doctors, it's lucrative, right, because you make 60% of $2,000 per visit.
00:27:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And if I see, if I see seven patients a day, which is typical, that's $14,000 and I get 60% of that. So that's like $9,000. mean, a doctor, there's, there's very few doctors in the United States that can make 9,000 a day. Plastic surgeons will hit that. Yeah, maybe just plastic surgeons can hit that. I mean, but there's very few doctors that can make 9,000 a day, except in this. So.
00:27:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so there's two components to this. That is your billing company gets 5%. But you as a doctor, generating those leads for yourself that 60%.
00:27:47 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, 60% on company gets 40%. Right. And of that 40% we think the profit margins. 10% 5% who knows. Well, now it's higher, right, not because now we've cut out we've done. So now of that 40%, the profit margin closer to like 20, 30%. So our profit is already higher in Esther's billing company now, but the old company was like 5% or less profit margin.
00:28:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So now your profit margin, her billing company is what?
00:28:20 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We haven't, it's only been open for the last year, so the trailing year, the numbers 30, maybe we think, maybe 20, maybe 15, I don't know. So what happened after that old company closed and we separated from our partner, I bring all my old business, like the legality of that, we're not quite sure. But we took all the business and we just said, more receivables are going to come into this new company, so it looks like we had this massive amount of revenue for very little work. So, technically, the old partner signed off is okay on that, so we're kind of legally covered, but so anyway, yeah, the whole last year and a half, like, revenue for B46 looks very good because we didn't have to do a lot of work for that revenue. But, but yeah, the trailing six months look like the profit margins are closer to 20.
00:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, I, my brain wants to ask questions about that, but I don't, I don't know if that's anything that you want to discuss about, but the one thing I would say is I'd get clear on that those numbers. Okay, because they're you're intermingling and you are, it's obviously taking that brain space. How well it's doing. It's an important thing to you into the family. So I would get really clear on the percentages and just go ahead and get your books really clearly caught up and then see what pops out.
00:30:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
anything.
00:30:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you're doing better than you thought you were, not doing as good as you thought you are, either way, knowing is going to be really empowering, especially with the rest of the conversation that we will have. So the two tracks are interesting. So let me go back to the top of these notes real quick. You said Q and E is your most profitable thing, right?
00:30:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yes.
00:30:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you currently spend about how many days a month?
00:30:34 - Fujinaka, M.D.
feel like you said it was like 10 or 11. Oh yeah, I have this up, I was going to show you.
00:30:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can I share my video?
00:30:41 - Fujinaka, M.D.
you see? see a spreadsheet or do you see a profit and loss marketing by twenty twenty oh that's that's July sorry okay okay so this is my QME calendar okay let me show you September it's a little cleaner August was messy because of the baby so this is the first week of September on the top row second week of September I have two days of work you'll see one day is called depot that's where I do cross examinations from home I call into court essentially and then I have like one two three four five six seven seven so I start at nine and at four and there's always some cancellations and then the next day I work is Thursday and it says San Landro so I have I go to San Landro which is about an hour away and these the visits I have so I do about ten visits this day then the following week I do one two This is three, four. So I do four days of work there. The following week after that, I do one, two, So in the month, I do one, two, four, five, six, eight, nine. Yeah, about nine, nine or 10. Sometimes eight, seven, seven. We usually try to fill up the places, like this is kind of empty. We try to avoid days where we only see four patients. try to, but we're booking three months ahead. So sometimes it's hard to predict if a month is gonna fill up. So like we thought this would fill up with at least six, but it only got four in the lottery in Sanderfell. Okay. Daily City, we're over pack, right? have 12 here. So that's gonna be a really busy day. And Oakland, this is about right. has, think there's seven here, right? So there are six. So that's about right. Stock 10, again, this is a little on the heavy side. There's nine, I think here. Modesto, it's about right, about nine. That's almost perfect. And then Merced, we just opened a location in Merced, California. That only has two, but because we're starting it, we will accept just doing two visits.
00:33:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I have a question. You as a doctor can only operate in 10 cities. Is that correct or is it the business?
00:33:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, my name, you know, yeah, me as a doctor can only have 10 locations at once. And you see, I actually have two San Jose. I have a, I have a North San Jose and a South San Jose location because I was getting so much in San Jose. Unfortunately, like the one of the San Jose, it just hasn't really borne out. The, the South San Jose location hasn't filled up as much as we thought. But we were getting such high volume there. We thought, okay, well, let's split San Jose actually east and west. We took it. We have a west location that's killing it. Let's try and eat San Jose, but it hasn't borne. out that it's given us more. So it's one of the ones that we might close next.
00:34:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That would be interesting to see the correlation between your reports, your appointments and the reports and see if it lines up because there isn't an algorithm that you guys can figure out yet to see if there's anything. And that's also something that we can feed to chat GBT. We have to figure out how to get the data to align. But basically if we can put the put it in the spread sheet so that we can say here's all the lottery information. Here's how many doctors. Here's the zip codes. Here's the injuries. Here's what we scheduled. patterns do you notice if any?
00:34:53 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I could have chat sheet if you look at it because the you know it's the row is built of zip code. There's a number of doctors. and the number of lotteries total, and it wouldn't be too hard to add in my own column to that and say, this is actually how many I got in this one, and then just put that one number, how my manager put that number for any new code, and then now you have all the data on one, you could put that in and attach it to chat to BT and say, hey, look at these, only these zip codes, and the rows associated with them, what trends do you see? Yeah.
00:35:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And what correlation do you see? But also I always ask it, what questions could I ask you to help me understand?
00:35:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Because I don't know what I don't know.
00:35:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm interested. What kind of analysis should I be asking you to do? you know, what other data might be helpful? All kinds of things. I ask questions all the way around it, because it has better capabilities than I do, and there are just some processes that I wouldn't
00:36:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
think of and sometimes it's helpful and sometimes it's not.
00:36:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sometimes it's just very simple. So feed it the data but also say, you know, when you ask your question, what am I not asking that I'm missing out on that I could be getting from this data?
00:36:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. That's a good question.
00:36:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ask it.
00:36:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So, yeah, I actually, I'll go ahead and request, like you said, the trailing months. Maybe I will do the two years, so I'll request the trailing two months of spreadsheets from the state of California. And then I have my manager just essentially go back and just put in. So, I'll probably have her put in the number of initials and the number of reevals. Yeah. think, oh, I don't know. The initials are what really tell me how I'm doing because sometimes I might get eight reevals, like if you don't like those, but some of these locations like you'll see in that like daily. city. I'm like, well, I got 10 people, but if you look at it, it's actually eight reevaluations and two initials. So that means, in the future, I'm only going to have two, if I only had two initials this month, I'm only going to get two return visits, because you usually see the patients.
00:37:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, right, right.
00:37:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So yeah, maybe in that spreadsheet, I don't know, think about it a little bit. Maybe I should just have, I'll put both numbers in, I'll have her do both, but the initial account and the reeval count, but the initial was the one I really want to, I really want to track. Okay. Yeah, but yeah, I'll do that.
00:37:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that's a great idea. Yeah, so the other thing, the other question to ask chat TPT is, do you notice any trends changing where it seems like, okay, so I would tell it how your business works, fully explain the lottery system and say, my goal is to figure you're out if there's a way I can increase my odds at obtaining customers through the yeah through the lottery system do you notice anything sorry that's oh yeah I've got a that sweet law um in 20 minutes um do you notice anything that might increase and I would tell it all the parameters I can only be in 10 zip codes it takes me six months to create a new all everything give it and make that one chat the chat about Q&E numbers and lottery you know yeah and then come back and let me know what what it tells you what you notice and then we'll take that but yeah let's I love when people will play smart and leverage AI so we can get some really good data really quickly yeah that's really exciting I love it I love it my work on that all right so let me go I had everything shrunk so I could see this. Let me, I'm just looking at your P&L for a minute.
00:39:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Which book would be for July or MFF?
00:39:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, July. July for July.
00:39:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
July for July, that's right.
00:39:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Whoa, don't do that. Okay.
00:39:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
The P&L. July P&L. July, July P&L.
00:39:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, you have January for July.
00:39:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
July's been my best month. My August isn't shaping up to look like this. Like I actually, we settled $100,000 with the cases. August looks like it's going to be close to 60. Oh, wow. Yeah, varies quite a lot. Maybe even 40. I don't know. We'll see.
00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how long have you been doing it this by yourself like this separate from the previous business with the partners?
00:40:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I actually have it ready for you here If you could see this it's kind of small, but I started in April I Started in April of 2023 that was month one these numbers are like how many months I've been in business so Month 16 is July so I've been so as of July I've been in month 16 months It's been open 16 months and these are the number of referrals I got per month. So the first month I got 80 then 120 so on Yeah, so then the Follow-up visits can't be very much Yeah, so These are the number of new referrals, but I don't track the number of follow-ups yet I could probably add that next month So if you have total visits completed does that include follow-ups? Yeah, this is initials and follow-ups.
00:41:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, I mean, just eyeballing that data. I would say you can't have that many follow-ups.
00:41:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, most of the time it's just one and done. I do an initial console and they're gone. I'm the MRI order.
00:41:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I order MRIs to physical data. Is there a way, so I assume you get paid for follow-ups also. Yeah. And is it a profitable? Is it, is there any difference really in initial sources follow-ups in terms of profits?
00:41:39 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I reduced my billing by three and so I built 1,200 for the initials and then 900 for follow-ups. No, there's, it's usually just to probe out a percent. I'll follow-up on maybe 250. So, it's still great. anything above like 150, I'm really happy.
00:41:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, There's multiple questions in this, but the best way to, well, we're always looking for leverage, and leverage is how do we get more out of what we already have. So there are already people that are coming across your path that have given you authority for whatever reason, lottery doesn't matter, but they have to talk to you, they have to deal with all these limiting parameters, right, they didn't come to you because they're trying to improve their health or whatever.
00:42:36 - Fujinaka, M.D.
But that doesn't mean there's not an opportunity for something.
00:42:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if you were to think about it, and again, these are accidents or whatever, do you think that there's any kind of follow-up care type of package that falls within your legal ability to offer to them that you would want to do that is just a tiny bit that would encourage them to come back that also might be paid for by insurance and somehow could be connected to, you know, is something that already pays helps them get it paid for and you get money in your pocket and they get a little additional like ethically actual real value. And then it could be something that's just let's increase your odds of making sure that everything's okay for you and that you know how to recognize the signs that I can compare how you work whatever.
00:43:37 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, no, it's you're brilliant to pick that up so quickly. Yes, there is. So right now, I make for instance, we'll just use sweet law after the initial consults done and I take care of that. I wait for their case manager to say hey, my client needs a follow-up visit with July medical. Can you give my client? and that's how I wait for permission but to your point yes I could proactively reach out to the case manager and say hey it's been six months six weeks since your client saw me would you like your client would you like you know for me to check up with your client to see how they're doing in a follow-up visit and proactively bug them the second way I could do it is I could try to get MRI results sent to me right now the MRIs I don't know where they get their MRIs I'm agnostic I just give them the order and tell their lawyer send them to an MRI at a hospital I don't care I could be more proactive about asking the case manager send me their MRI send me their MRI so I look at it and that prompts the case manager say oh yeah they got the MRI why don't you see them again so yes there's there's actually one more part
00:45:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
part that I think that you could do that actually benefits you and the attorneys that send them over to you based off of what I know about street law is that first of all tag teaming a doctor and the attorney office saying we recommend you go in for a follow-up to make sure that nothing has appeared since your initial visits because it can right over time.
00:45:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh yeah, new body parts that started to get sore.
00:45:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right and so it maybe it was there before but they just didn't notice and then it starts nagging long enough that their brain goes oh actually this is bugging me I just didn't realize because a lot of people just don't realize but the attorney's office benefits right because if they if the injury is more significant then higher settlement and they get a higher percentage and then you get more business but ethically we're also helping the person who's busy who really doesn't want to deal with any of this doesn't want to deal with our health issues that might happen. that more problems 10, 20, 30 years down the road, that if somebody had just looked out for them and said, you should go do this, and just make sure, because things do take time to kind of present themselves. So if you could create a system where, look, this is what happens, I need you to put it on your calendar in six weeks, mark a follow up, unless I tell you 100%, we don't need another follow up. And then you pitch them on the idea, the main person say, go make sure your people are doing this, because there's no way, there's no way, there's no way. I'm gonna tell you to do the math and you track it. There's no way that if you didn't implement a system like this, you're not going to see profit margins increase. It may not be a huge amount, but it for sure will be above and beyond what it costs you to do that.
00:46:53 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, okay.
00:46:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because you're giving two authority sources, your attorney and your doctor telling you to do same thing. And as long as you know that you're being ethical about it, meaning there's nobody coming in, you're 100% sure they don't need to be reached out again, in which case you should tag them, flag them and say, do not follow up with this person so that you know you're operating an integrity.
00:47:18 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, that's going to give you a lift. Yeah, yeah, I agree. That's what was saying too. Yeah, I, uh, yeah, I don't have a real good answer for why I don't do that. Yeah, I don't have a good answer.
00:47:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just, I didn't ask a question. Why don't you do that? I'm just saying, let's do it.
00:47:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I right now, like, um, I'll have to think of a solution for a way to tag that it's been six weeks, six, eight weeks since their first visit.
00:47:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that actually comes back to you. What I wanted to see was how do you manage your clients?
00:47:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What is your just done. This is confidential, so please don't share this.
00:48:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't.
00:48:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, no. Yeah, so when a new referral comes in, I simply, we have an email inbox. I actually don't even have an example here. So we get this email like this from an attorney and says, Hi, you know, my patient wants a new consultation. Please tell us when they fit. What we do is we've added an email program, and it allows us to tag emails. And we tag it as new referral. And once that tag gets on it, it goes to a scheduler. And then once the scheduling is done, they tag it that scheduling and demographics is done. It goes to another person who preps the the business notes. So they go into my Google drive and for a patient. they make a folder. So like they put their name on their folder, the patient's name, DataBird, and then they put this thing, they make an invoice, they do a new patient visit note, which is like a templated note, and then they do a order form note. So it has like prescriptions that I wanna have to memorize. And once my staff does that, then it's ready for the appointment. And so when I get on the phone or the video with them, I open the folder, it already has the invoice, it has the note, pretty much made the order form. I fill in the blanks. After the visit's done, I go through and I mark that the appointment's complete, which is what happened here. And then I okay it for final, and that lets the team send it out. So everything is done with email tagging. So that's why I was trying to figure out, is there a way, I just, don't know a good way to put the six-week tag, because once we're done, I put completed as a tag, but yeah, generally, I don't really know a good way.
00:50:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll think about You could do initial complete and then follow up for six weeks, something like that. You would have to alter your system, but also, this needs to be in a database, and this needs to be in something. This long-term and scalable. There's much potential for loss, and also insufficient data. You can't go in and see how many cases are in X status. You should be able to see that.
00:50:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I have sort of that. I can check how many... This column right, it don't tell me that there's 13 reports that we're waiting on the signature. These are okay for final. I have okay them, but the patient hasn't signed their... consent form, so we can't send them yet. So we do kind of have that, but like we don't have a way to like you know like rolling check like these are there's four people that are ready for today. These are the four that are going to have appointments today with us. So we kind of I can kind of see it like that, but it's all just very real time.
00:51:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's not a great long term solution. It's amazing for being email. I mean, I'm proud for that. What's it called that you're using?
00:51:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I just did Melli's. Okay, so this goes back to two, you know, early on when we when I was talking to Mark about starting this business, we had said that, you know, we we have I have to be sort of careful that I don't get too big law firms to get big. But doctors, if we get too big, we stick up like a nail.
00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then the insurance company is investing in us.
00:52:03 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So initially, I don't have to talk to Mark more about this, but he was saying, you know, you want to try to stay around like maybe 400 a month. And again, he's saying, you know, and obviously it depends on the lawyer, right? If you're taking cases from lawyers that confabulate, they lie about their cases, they try to make the patients look hurt, you're going to get investigated along with those law firms. So, you know, his point is always like, take good business. Yeah. And that's what, I mean, we have, I think for the most part been taking, like I've cut out a couple law firms that I know lie about their patients. But I am at that point, you can see from my numbers where we are getting really close to like that 400. so that's why like right now I'm really happy where I am. I'm not really looking at, like if I could just keep this volume, this is, I'm really happy. This is like a one point, maybe $1.5 million a year business for me. At this level, it takes very little work. I mean, I only work on this, what, four hour, five hours a week.
00:53:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have a ceiling that you've installed intentionally. And you're okay with that. And so then the your wealth increase you would want through July or. Delta or other other things and just make sure that this is managed. As well as possible to reduce maybe the time the energy. Maybe increase the profit margins by improving operations, but not increasing business volume.
00:53:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Is that right? Yeah, that's a good summary. mean, yeah, it's at a good place right now. mean, like if you look at the P and L right like my contractors cost me 20,000 a month. I mean, that is, and you know, total expenses are about 40. I mean, it's my profit margins are about like for this month, we're about 60%. And I think the profit margin, I think, is only going to go up because I'm going to collect more for the same amount of expense. My expenses, this expense isn't going to go up. So, yeah, mean, I think if I start settling out more cases and I'm starting to make 150, 200 a month, that expense is going to stay the same. And, yeah, so anyway, yeah.
00:54:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so, and I did it again, I blended QME in July for a minute because we're talking about July 1st. So, QME and July have fixed ceilings that the most important thing that you can do inside of them is make sure that you've got the most efficient system. So, it reduces how much time, energy it takes and max profit margins, but there is a cap and you're very near the top at both of them.
00:55:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, mean, July, based on what I've heard from Mark with my current business in California, and QMEs, I'm limited by the 10 locations and physically how many days a month I want to do, or I can't do, QMEs, there are other ways I can expand.
00:55:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can get direct referrals for work comp, I didn't go into that with you.
00:55:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
But for July, I mean, in California, this is where I kind of want to sit almost right there. The other way that we could do it is I could expand other states and start opening separate clinics in each state, right, and ramp each state individually up to 400.
00:55:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which is what we're doing with Sweet Law is expanding in the states, and that's been it's been crazy to watch.
00:55:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I heard, yeah, so actually I hadn't even readressed this ceiling issue until we just talked about it. But yeah, I mean, it's this operation. mission is so simple how I have it like with the email like actually now that you mentioned maybe like the easiest path to another million of revenue for my family is just opening it up in Washington and opening it up and I have I've expanded July like these numbers that you see these new referrals I mean we know that about probably 40 of these or 50 are coming from Washington, New Mexico, Washington, Mexico and Arizona and uh sweet loss sending it to us right and other laws because we're in all those states right so I'm following mark but I could branch off from July and open a brand new clinic in Washington brand new one in Arizona that would technically allow me to ramp up each of those states the 400 so yeah I'll think about that actually it's interesting so when you think about it what I would like you to do is do the inventory what would that take what would it look like so what would be the time impact
00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
for you, what would be the human resources that you need, would be the marketing, like draw the whole picture, what would have to happen, what would be the timeline, what would be the cost, is there, are you going to be negative at any point, like are you going to have to output money, probably not, but if you did, what does that look like? And then, so the biggest math is going to be time and energy impact for you because if that, if we can keep that to something you're willing to do, let's say 10 hours a month, whatever that looks like, really do the math to that and the revenue because the numbers are going to tell you you should do it or not. I can just about bet with what I've seen in your schedule that another state, one other state could be like the whole difference of a year, but also what you learn out of it and the additional financial resources that it could give you to maybe put. towards other things, maybe hiring, maybe marketing firms, maybe better software, whatever, I don't really know, like we're really just getting into this. But doing a projection exercise about what it would look like to go into, and I would be strategic about even the projecting state, like I would run the projections across multiple states, get as much data as you can to kind of and figure that out. So a correlation for, Mark, you said you're in Washington, New Mexico, in California, and Arizona, and then Missouri, because Mark's going into Missouri now. Right. And he's also Nevada and Texas, Texas.
00:58:41 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We pulled out of Texas, actually.
00:58:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I marked it. That's why I did this. Texas, you don't mess with Texas for lots of reasons. I'll let you hop off, but I love that. I'll run that. Thank you for noticing time because I didn't. Anyway, take care.

Oh, she had to see a RSB?
00:01:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No. But he lives in India. I can stick in India front with the best place. to music based on what I was checking. And cells in their last. Oh, something weird is happening in the zoom. What's this? That's weird. Something on zoom is like. Going in and out. I can see it on the screen, but I don't know what it is.
00:02:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, something in zoom is going in and out.
00:02:38 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, like something was turning green and then red.
00:02:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But.
00:02:47 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, I don't think I don't have. I mean, if I turn up the iPods. And you have to switch to laptop. Which I lose my big screen. How do I not have pulling in headphones here? Don't go. Cause I don't use for your headphones.

Well, I mean, worst case scenario, you could call in and still share screen.
00:03:40 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Finally enough, that's what I was, that was my original plan. And then I was like, no, I'm going to, I'm going to try it. That's what you get for trying, Dan.
00:03:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know. trust the technology. I was playing around with. day period yesterday and um for either what do you call it have them or zoom i i set up two different ones oh i wasn't sure like you were hearing and dialing it anyway um my goal what i want to be to do is have it extract any of the comments from the transcripts that are mine and see if there's anything that's like is that a value or principle that i have right is that something that i was teaching or whatever so it can kind of put in my library of stuff yeah um so we'll see if it captures anything today what's the zap doing um so there's one that goes from fathom that's supposed to extract this transcript and but the fathom zaps weren't really in the So I honestly don't expect to do anything. Also, it wasn't really clear to me, and I'm not as a pure user, really. And then the zoom one, it went from a zoom transcript to, and I wasn't sure that I choose the right thing. It's like it has a built-in parser, but you don't see the parser. It just shows you the different things, but it's looking and acting like a parser. So I think that's what's happening. But anyway, so it goes from that and then dumps it into a Google Doc, the transcript into a Google Doc, and then you interact with chat TPT in that recipe and that's up and give it a message. And the message is, I want you to extract anything, you know, that's said by Tina Marie and, you know, store to my library. whatever that all the instructions that I wanted to do. So we'll see if it does anything. I imagine it's going to be several iterations and tweaking and probably some customer support, but if somebody else hasn't already thought of that and done that to be like, okay, let me build my library of my own content kind of thing. I'm sure I'm not the only one who's thought of it.
00:06:22 - Dan’s iPhone
I have a buddy that's well, Vans. Vans, I don't even know what the he's talking about. But he is like, you know, he's not trading crypto anymore because his buddy traded the account. So he went down the AI rabbit hole and he is building personal exactly what you're talking about. Like, it's you and AI is what he calls it. And he's he's built this thing where you feed the AI your stuff. And it becomes like an extension of you. So I was I turned him on. like, oh, it's like second brain. It's like, what's that? told him. Um, but he's like super duper into this now where he built one where like, I mean, might get this wrong, but he was saying like he's built one that like a preacher can use to help write his sermons, but you're constantly feeding it your stuff. And then you're asking it things from you, from you. Like you're asking new questions or something like, I don't know, but he says it works great. He's like super freaking jazzed on it.
00:07:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like, okay. Yeah, I can't remember because, um, almost a year ago, there was one that I was starting and I created a Tina bar. even remember what it was now. I'm doing a search and I can't find a thing. I originally started it.
00:07:59 - Dan’s iPhone
It's crazy how much more there. is one. He built it himself. So he's he's building it like yeah, we're using chat using open AI 4.4 or four lower cases.
00:08:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, whatever the hell it is. And probably Python because chat TBT can tell you how to do it and build it. They're not hard to build. No, yeah, I abandoned it in the first place because I'm like, I'm going to go build my own. And then I couldn't get one single file to be found. And it like for days that kept happening. I'm I'm not gonna tell me to spend days on this.
00:08:37 - Dan’s iPhone
Totally. Eric and I were working on something for quick and flowing. We needed to do like a date reformat. I was trying to send it to Zapier. Reformat it and then bring it back in. But when you brought it back in to high level, like you couldn't you couldn't get it back into high level in a way that you could use it the way that we needed basically. Just it wasn't going to happen. So then we were like, he was like, oh, we could use the custom code function. They have this new custom code function that it's JavaScript only. And I go, okay, great. Just have chat GPT write the JavaScript. And he's like, I've never done that. so I don't know what his prompt was, but he gave it a prompt to write this date reformatter code. It spit out the code. Then he had to figure out how you present that code in this function inside of go high level, which took a couple tries, but then ultimately it worked. It was like, holy , dude. So now we can have chat GPT write this JavaScript whenever we need to use in this custom code block. And then right after that, He's they're complaining about how Munir blah blah blah blah blah like what are we gonna do and Somewhat jokingly, but not really I'm like Gutenberg blocks their JavaScript. I go. Why don't you just ask chat GPT, but that's how to make a Gutenberg block.
00:10:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, you said and It does He's like, can I can I explore this?
00:10:28 - Dan’s iPhone
go absolutely like you so now if we have these finished blocks that need to be tweaked That seems a lot easier to do than just start Building blocks from scratch not having ever built a block, right? So you know Munir's experience is baked into these blocks, but he didn't invent the code He just knew his way around so I go.
00:10:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I guarantee you I was just gonna say I bet because we're the GPT for oh, um the token limits have increased exponentially. But you could probably dump as much of his code and you could dump multiple snippets. the limitations that used to be, you can only upload four or five files at a time. And the last time I uploaded eight at one time in one session, one comment. And, but you could like have it look at his code and say, you know, is there, do you anticipate any compatibility issues with your code in this code?
00:11:38 - Dan’s iPhone
Yep. Yeah, and it's like, and they, this one, and there's code, I think they want to borrow from one block and bring to another. So I'm like, if you have the code, then you can probably give it what the code and say, hey, this code does XYZ. I need to take that and put into this. So he was like. Oh my God. So that's why I'm like, Muneer's not really part of the team. Anyway, we can now, we wouldn't have been able to ride all these blocks on our own with Chad TBT, like it wouldn't be anywhere near as good, but now going forward, we can maintain that and extend them came over.
00:12:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Which would be great. I still keep thinking about whatever Muneer's done. So I had one dollar almost die from RSV and it's really common.
00:12:32 - Dan’s iPhone
Six months is the age, the page.
00:12:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's usually between two months and two years, but it basically think of COVID, but for babies.
00:12:43 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, yeah.
00:12:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know what it is.
00:12:45 - Dan’s iPhone
He just didn't, he didn't indicate anything. was. But I will.
00:12:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. It is. It's a new. age. I've been spending I don't even spend a lot. Okay, this is how weird it is. I was on the gym last night and normally I can't do my workout without like a particularly paced type of music. It has to be at a pace to keep my energy and my heart rate going or I just kind of start to fade. But I was talking to GPT. I was like banging out chapters and telling stories and stuff. It was just so weird. I was just watching myself. I'm like, I'm walking through the gym talking to a robot. It's just so weird. It's so weird.
00:13:43 - Dan’s iPhone
But it's awesome.
00:13:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's crazy. Okay, so here's one thing that I did. last night I was telling the story and I was talking about how it's crazy to me that a year ago I started lifting weights. And my primary thing at that point was just trying to heal my immobility, my mobility, but because I couldn't, I could barely move my shoulder. I had frozen shoulder, I had really bad tennis elbow. Glenn couldn't help me. I think because Glenn was bathing me too much because he's like, you're in a lot of pain and I just don't want to mess it up. Like he was scared and that wasn't helpful to me. But anyway, so I was telling it, I'm like, I started going to the gym and I was trying to heal something. And then what I've noticed is that within a few months, know, my I wasn't having that pain anymore. But then other pain I didn't even know I had was going away. Like I realized that I'm popping up and down the stairs, carrying, having things and my knees like feel great. But I didn't really, lies how bad they had been feeling going down the stairs and that I was I was bending my knees out when I would go down the stairs like I was changing how I walked because it was hurting and I'm like now it's a year later and some of my muscle groups are increased by 200% and others by 300% based on you know how much I can lift and how fluidly and whatever and but I really have only been going once maybe twice a week and sometimes some months it was only like there would be 11 day gaps between going or 16 day gap was the longest one when I was sick but I'm like even still like my body composition has changed completely I've lost inches and I don't have any pain anywhere ever even with fibromyalgia and it was just crazy but I was I was telling it I'm like this is an application for everything in life even business if you show up consistently everything improves. You don't even have to do it every single day. But if you if something is on your mind constantly and you keep applying yourself to it, there will be improvement. And there will be improvement you didn't anticipate happening. And so I was just like store this because I'm gonna I need to find a place to use it. And it's like, okay, let's put this into building a solid foundation chapter two. And I was like, what the. So it rewrote my chapter, inserting my story, and then pulling it out for the different sections that we had already written and finished. And that was really cool. Because GPT for like the one before this could not have done that.
00:16:46 - Dan’s iPhone
Right.
00:16:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Those iterations are wild that this and but like we really only started using this about a year and a half ago. Right. Now look at what it's at. And the pace is only going to get faster because the learning models are feeding each other. We've got all these new engineers on it and new prompters plugging data into it, learning how to work with it. That pace is just going to go crazy. So in terms of like teams. Who we need to do what some things are just going to be not necessarily obsolete, but how they show up is going to need to be different. So people that were. Show up and I do this in my job kind of thing, right, that coast coasting is going to go away for most of these positions because people hiring them are going to be like at your pace, I could go get a robot to do that. Well, I need you to do is take what I can't do and be strategic and say, do this, that, the other thing, but anyway. It's eye-opening, what it can do.
00:18:06 - Dan’s iPhone
It's a brand new world, as they say.
00:18:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. it keeps being a brand new world. That's what's even crazier. like blink and it'll change. Okay. um, or start, um, kind of what do you call it? Like prompted by thinking about what to give us role in what he's doing. And even more after the conversation we just had. and also, like, so just to recap what I was talking about last week. Um, to look at where you're at, where you're going by the end of We're taking a look at it. Potentially. wanting to do something with Joe where you've got multiple people on it of a certain type. know, I just want to really look at what we're working with right now and just kind of get an update visual on where we're going. So anyway, you had it in like, it was a flow chart type thing. I feel like I can't remember what it was called. I know because I've used it for years, but I don't use it consistently.
00:19:39 - Dan’s iPhone
I said, your guess is as good as mine.
00:19:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It wasn't like mine, Meister, but it was something like that, like, gliffy, gliffy.
00:19:48 - Dan’s iPhone
You either loose the chart or if you think it was gliffy. I know I used both at different points in my career.
00:20:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know, oops, but I really do think it was goofy, because I don't really use listed charts, but it could have been, let me just search my fee.
00:20:12 - Dan’s iPhone
I'm just going to log in and see what's where.
00:20:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There you go.
00:20:29 - Dan’s iPhone
A little Losing chart, my dog is losing his mind because he wants a my daughter's Oh, he's searching dead.
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm Ryan and Glippy. Oh accountability and org chart, but that was like 2018. And then Evan Mark Katz came up. Your buddy accountability and org chart. Glippy Google Drive. This is. I remember because it was an export and I can't see it and drive. It's very whatever needed to see it would be. Let's see what the log in. I overdid it at the gym last night. I'm my shoulder. It's hurting me. My neck, neck, shoulder.
00:22:02 - Dan’s iPhone
I'm like, they're stuck and I'm like, what is this? I didn't make this.
00:22:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We had Stacy do the last arm chart now that I think about it.
00:22:16 - Dan’s iPhone
Nope. No, she didn't.
00:22:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Let me search Tumor for arm charts, see what we can find.
00:22:28 - Dan’s iPhone
No one to glippy. Yeah. Your account has expired.
00:22:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I, you know, I just got the same thing.
00:22:37 - Dan’s iPhone
I don't want to buy it. Where's the preversion glippy? Right. I don't know if there's anything in here. I don't want to buy. I don't want to That's all I know. All right. I haven't had what, I haven't had a Glyphia accounts 2019, I don't think Stacey was here.
00:23:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No.
00:23:24 - Dan’s iPhone
Oh, I think it's actually in Google. I think it's a Google, what you're going to say.
00:23:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, like a flowchart.
00:23:33 - Dan’s iPhone
Whatever their thing, their slide thing.
00:23:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because we did have her do something. Okay, yeah, that sounds about right.
00:23:54 - Dan’s iPhone
doesn't seem like it's been that long. The one that you and I missed. Or that this is the last. What I mean, that is so grossly complicated. So this ain't it or if it is, it ain't.
00:24:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you got?
00:24:15 - Dan’s iPhone
Let's see. Wait, hold on, looking at what other ones I have. And here's Bobby, did this one come for? Yeah, I mean, this doesn't even have Stacy on it. This was accurate at some point. This is what I thought it was going to be. It ain't this.
00:25:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh. Let me see, like, let me open my assume more. No, going. Oh, yeah. Um. David, look, I forgot about him.
00:25:28 - Dan’s iPhone
He's still mad.
00:25:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is he?
00:25:31 - Dan’s iPhone
Oh, yeah.
00:25:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
00:25:38 - Dan’s iPhone
No, he worked out of the office. He comes here, like, multiple days a week.
00:25:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sometimes I'll...
00:25:45 - Dan’s iPhone
What does he do? He doesn't do anything to me. Oh. He just works out of here, I should say.
00:25:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He can't do He He doesn't have lunch sometimes, because I think, Brandon... Mm-hmm.
00:26:08 - Dan’s iPhone
I mean, more when you own the building, that's what I'm in office space for years, like I've never ever charged him. He's been in the last two, right? I don't think he ever came to the one and he's a skate one or he never worked out there, he worked out a skateboard one, skate shop one. He's a little to do stuff. He's great. Don't need him yet.
00:26:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, let's see. Can you share that so I can look at it without squinting? he's squinting. Yeah, zoom or email with.
00:27:15 - Dan’s iPhone
Oh, there we go. Your share is free.
00:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. yeah. Okay. Okay, where's the zoom in? Okay. Where's that? Seriously. It will not zoom. Okay. All right. Holly. Well, now, so this isn't labeled. Okay, that is basis. Oh, who's Holly?
00:27:59 - Dan’s iPhone
That was the. the role. So Holly was the person at the time, I was like, oh, was going to be somebody it would be her. That now became Stacy.
00:28:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so let's change that.
00:28:18 - Dan’s iPhone
But that sort of role still.
00:28:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I she's more like, what would you call her?
00:28:27 - Dan’s iPhone
I don't know that I'm not good at that. I don't I don't do titles. So I don't use them and I don't grant them.
00:28:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's kind of my issue with org charts and like corporate style type organization for small businesses because I call it compartmentalized rules.
00:28:51 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, I call her a side. Like, what if what does Stacy do? like, she's my sidekick. I don't know what that is.
00:29:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would call it more like administrative supports because you being admin but like she helps in everything and it's generic but that's because she does so many different things.
00:29:20 - Dan’s iPhone
I mean she's yeah exactly it's like project management but it's not much because it is I don't know but I'm not going to get hung up on that because it's for nobody so right well if that's the case then do you not want to do this at all? No no I'm just saying so here it is I mean this is way less than this right it is so like you don't have anybody for sales it's you no it ain't me I don't even know sales like this I mean I'm not thinking about like you talking to Joe are you talking about anybody anybody that's
00:30:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
interested in working with you is because you've talked to them. So if sales exists, it's damn.
00:30:06 - Dan’s iPhone
I wouldn't even say it's a real role though, right?
00:30:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like this, it's this temporary thing. Well, so like there's the difference between roles and function. And then there's the question, do we organize according to roles or function?
00:30:27 - Dan’s iPhone
I don't think it's function. In my version of the world, it's never going to exist. It existed here because we were going to start selling it to everybody. But in the version that I actually like, I don't want it to be associated with me at all. I mean, I think you could have it here and say, there's someone else wanted to do it, yeah, but I'm not even doing sales, right? me talking to Joe is like me partnering with Joe, right? Right part was the word that I was like, yeah, I had like partner relations Yeah, Joe's gonna sell it, but he's not selling basis really he's telling his his Partnership version of right his sort of Whatever right it's like he's not Really not like if it weren't a pot if someone came along and they weren't a podcaster I would never expect him to talk to them or deal with them at all right if a cold lead came in It's never going Joe.
00:31:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know if it would go to anybody I put it here partner relations today and yeah, I mean that's accurate so then Just get rid of sales Well, I mean part of me thinks I should That's a good idea Yeah How about you make a copy and you keep that and we work on this one
00:32:00 - Dan’s iPhone
I'm going to make a copy and work a couple.
00:32:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Then I need the copy shared.
00:32:07 - Dan’s iPhone
Please. I know these people aren't. Maybe it's in a shared folder. Poop, poop, poop, poop.
00:33:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I got my new food service started and I love it but yesterday I was supposed to get a delivery and I got held up and I'm like, oh, I just put myself in a situation that I really don't like. I'm expecting something I want and I can't have it. I don't like that. But it has already been opening my eyes to like other options and things that can get that are clean that are at the grocery store that are pre made. Not a few but some brands that I didn't know about. But it's been really nice having variety and healthy food like there's like this cauliflower and we need to know about super good. My daughter's like, I almost. I up in my mouth. I liked it.
00:34:06 - Dan’s iPhone
What if I put my own on?
00:34:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dude, oh, there it is. There's the dog. Okay. Okay. in this one, we could either just disconnect sales or just get rid of it. But I think we should make it according to what we're doing now and just get rid of it. They can always be added back in.
00:34:31 - Dan’s iPhone
Well, I'm gonna leave it because I have no idea how to edit this. So removing is easy. Like I don't want to know who made this.
00:34:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I guess it was me. Yeah, I think we did it together because I remember this. Let's see. Define, join, change, rotate, ungroup. I'm gonna do this and then see if I can undo it.
00:34:58 - Dan’s iPhone
I don't know if that wasn't it. Well, well, well, well, great thing is a nice show.
00:35:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I do.
00:35:07 - Dan’s iPhone
Can't hide.
00:35:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, no. Just like. Oh, look what I did.
00:35:26 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah. That works. like.
00:35:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay, you don't exist right now.
00:35:46 - Dan’s iPhone
Is there any.
00:35:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can we drag over? But at least we know like we can tell just by that that it's not something we're doing right now. Okay, so David, all of that stuff. Same thing. Can we just get rid of that part?
00:36:00 - Dan’s iPhone
Well, no, I mean that there's some validity to that. I think what is the new represent so we have partners migration. Oh, new sites.
00:36:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then maintenance, but David's not the dude.
00:36:18 - Dan’s iPhone
And there's no dude really.
00:36:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, would you not call that so like what happens is you tell Greg to go design something. I mean, so far there hasn't even been like a new new site, right?
00:36:39 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, probably would be with the podcasting building one right now, but it's not for basis. So has there been a new new site that is not JB? And then I mean the podcasting isn't everything. But it would go under partners though, right?
00:37:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I think it would be new sites, but under partners.
00:37:13 - Dan’s iPhone
I mean, there's things like literally yesterday was thinking, what if it's only ever that, right? So I'm like, I should position it to start as that it's the solution for podcasting, period. And then later on adding these other things if it ever comes to that. So it's like shouldn't the messaging be, hey, I know that we made this full podcast. That's all we do, even though it's not the plan, but that's the current plan. Maybe the current plan is the plan. So in that regard, then there's just production and no partners, there is maintenance. There.
00:37:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean. Open. you do this you're going to be doing something similar with mom right so it's not just podcasting like you have at least two legs on this no nothing none of that it's built on none of that gets built on basis oh okay yeah that's all it gets built on high level and bampoli which is a totally different org guard yeah which i need to make a note for that that we want to have a org chart for that for mom um okay well so the org chart should be based off of what we're doing now and what we're working on now and even you know with the conversation once now through the end of the year i don't see you going just knowing the pace that you work at unless something presents itself but even still it would only be in the beginning of like let's talk it out there mazes. So we can make this around podcasting. So there's the functionality of the current thing. So there's partners because you have, what's his face, binaural beats. Jodi, I can't say Cody, but I'm like, it's not Cody. Um, Jodi, and strong marriage now. Empire.
00:39:36 - Dan’s iPhone
No empires in that part.
00:39:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, Jodi and strong marriage now, then, and Wolfar, which probably is maybe going away, but.
00:39:51 - Dan’s iPhone
Well, I mean, in that part, you know, my plan is, are there going to be any future partners? No. Right. So it's like, partners even goes away.
00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if this is that it doesn't because it's still like this like unless you're planning on getting rid of all those it still needs to be done right now they're just maintenance there there's you know I mean there's no stand alone so then you're just looking at like this yeah I still think that there should be something specified between in-house like I guess it's under development and this all should so production is it even production or is it under develops the dev ops the maintenance production Do you got an I in there? Is that not Avishak and Vijay in there too?
00:41:25 - Dan’s iPhone
It's really these guys.
00:41:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's like I'm just going to call them repressed because so what is these guys these three Eric have a check oh oh you're not looking at zoom I'm looking at it in the actual document so when you said these guys I was like what are you talking about okay so that team right so they're like a like a team yeah um there no I can have it so
00:42:00 - Dan’s iPhone
But I said, I was like, this is your stuff. Bye.
00:43:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You You don't have anybody for that?
00:43:15 - Dan’s iPhone
They don't currently exist, but like a future role, particularly.
00:43:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How future?
00:43:29 - Dan’s iPhone
So right now it's just Noriel, so I mean, I guess it's Noriel really right now. It depends, it depends, it depends if we need it. Right now we don't necessarily need them.
00:43:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So why would you put that there and not the, you know, future or, you know, down the side at the bottom or something?
00:44:00 - Dan’s iPhone
under Noreo. So I did like what Noreo and I discussed was all right you're what if we just move you to being the code over Lord therefore he would be over some level of larval developer but right now he's occupying that role so okay about hey if I reduce what I pay you and we bring in junior dev to do that that's that's where we're at so the person exists by the end of the year okay it can see me everything there should be no TBD like that should be separate let's not do that language okay sorry right so that role exists there we do have a larval dev so while I'm looking at underneath bobby um in the project management and you've got css pine and you don't even use pine grow anymore do you we're I'm still up here we gotta get our way down there
00:45:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, okay, okay. I'll calm myself.
00:45:03 - Dan’s iPhone
Yes, that doesn't even exist then Because the blocks right right Oh Yeah, I forgot about that CC. Right.
00:45:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So like teach day You Okay.
00:46:31 - Dan’s iPhone
I know, I'm like, I can't even see those numbers.
00:46:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So where does give a fit in this? doesn't really, or doesn't do something. No.
00:46:47 - Dan’s iPhone
No. He's just like a floating. It would be like, he's like an upward person, right? They don't have a permanent. It's a if and when kind of thing. It's like I'm floating out, don't even know, like it's none of these.
00:47:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who is responsible for managing any like temporary contract tech people?
00:47:12 - Dan’s iPhone
No, he doesn't manage anybody.
00:47:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I'm asking you who me. Yeah.
00:47:22 - Dan’s iPhone
And they're, you know, are you not part of the dev ops team though, also? No. I have no idea what's going on there right now. Like illustrated earlier. So like I hear about it, but I'm not intimately involved. I'm hit right. I basically try to get into him and to him. To Noria or Eric. I don't really ever talk to Avish. I can DJ unless they ask me stuff directly, which happens here and there. Or Stacy will tell me they asked me something, which happens more frequently. the other? Did you answer their question? What question? They asked your question.
00:48:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay. Well, I just think like just the hiring and the giving the jobs and who does what you do that and it's not represented here.
00:48:25 - Dan’s iPhone
I think there's not even the same. Well, it's not because I hire people on a lark for like random that I do, right? when I hire somebody to do a straight, I mean it's whatever.
00:48:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it kind of falls under ideas.
00:48:47 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, it's so infrequent. It's not frequent or there's no level of permanence to it. These that grow up permanent, although even
00:49:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so let's get down to production then.
00:49:13 - Dan’s iPhone
Who singing? This is. Traverse.
00:49:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I thought somebody in the office was singing because I can't really like hear music. It sounded just like somebody in the background singing without music.
00:49:41 - Dan’s iPhone
There is the music. It's a lie about.
00:49:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So. And Eric takes over like any new projects, right, he's like in charge of them? No.
00:50:23 - Dan’s iPhone
No. Okay. So it's, I mean, again, this is where you'd say it's like the WordPress team, but it's not even, it's, that's the thing, right, I don't even know that there's really no dev in production. It's done over here and then given to production.
00:50:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so define the process. What happens when you're like, we need a new site, or we need to migrate site.
00:51:00 - Dan’s iPhone
whatever. It gets Stacy's sense of damage. That's it. Okay, so like Bobby doesn't know Eric doesn't get the introduction Stacy, not Bobby. Right, that's what I'm saying. Like Bobby's definitely not down here.
00:51:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And then would you not maybe just drag that up and then like take the lines over to WordPress instead of things underneath it.
00:51:48 - Dan’s iPhone
Well, so over here there this is where they do dev outside of like for product not as part of production like so let's say that these guys I'm trying to think of it like them doing this whole block thing like it has nothing to do with production.
00:52:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's part of WordPress, so it's like production is just like, I get that, I get that, which is why I'm saying production is its own block, but it links to those people that already exist on the org chart rather than duplicating them on the org chart.
00:52:30 - Dan’s iPhone
But no, right? So yeah, mean it would go to these two guys, so you could definitely do that.
00:52:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And those two guys are still serving the same overall skill set function in the business. It may be a different department that calls on them, but I think, so I always think in terms of simplest, right? Rather than have a whole bunch of blocks and positions and seats, whatever, sometimes we have, I mean, whatever, they are the WordPress people and they're, they're used for internal and, and other projects. I just, I just don't think that any name should be repeated more than once if we can find a way to organize the structure that really shows what it actually looks like and I don't know how else to explain it. I'm bringing us not doing that well, but I don't, I think that we should try to, I think the simplest format is one where one person's name only shows up once and everything that's attached to them is attached to them.
00:53:46 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah. Yeah.
00:53:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because that's more accurate like we, it's a lean team. If we can, I think having the ability to visualize its simplicity, as it is, will help us as we're looking at growth, but also as you look at other projects that you're maybe influencing, or even just like, like David, you know, if you're having a conversation about how simple things are, and go like, look at this, this is my team. Look at everything that we do. You know, you've got another 71, which is a different org chart, it's a small, but it's still a small team, and it's still, you know, almost a $4 million.
00:54:44 - Dan’s iPhone
Is it? don't know where it's at Okay.
00:55:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you know that that's and how you know how many of them are actually full-time Or work full-time Work full-time None Yeah, so Probably. Yeah Anyway, just that's the thing is And the other thing is when it starts to get too big and too complicated is when implosion happens and that's relative Impertinent and important information for somebody like David because he tends to Just go to horizontal And David who go ahead and I'm just saying you have a habit, like people ask you for advice and sometimes that leads to new partnerships, but either way, if you have a visual way to represent how simple your step is, number one, I think we've run it better, I think you are better, you know, help other people that you just, you just do it anyway, but now you've got a visual tool. Well, I don't think we have enough visual representations. I don't think there's enough documented for any of our stuff, and especially in its simplest form, and I think that that's something that I think it's a lever that's been neglected and definitely because I haven't been helping it the way I should. Wow, you are first key today. Remember that the commercial for Frisky food for the cats, they were just pouncing on everything. I'm like playing with balls. That was the assignment today, Dan. But please put Greg in design because it's driving me next that it's TBD this long.
00:57:42 - Dan’s iPhone
I already did that.
00:57:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's weird.
00:57:45 - Dan’s iPhone
It was because he was in a different block. No, I just moved this block.
00:57:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't see Greg show up.
00:57:53 - Dan’s iPhone
There we go. I mean, here's the thing, right? It's like, do you even separate production? I mean, I guess we could do. Oh, I gotta go backwards now. I can use myself.
00:58:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's worth the effort. I can almost guarantee them. Can't, because it may not be this way, but you going through this, you'll just be driving along and have another epiphany because you saw something that you didn't really notice, you saw. Every time we do a visual exercise, something comes out of it that wasn't anticipated.
00:58:50 - Dan’s iPhone
That's pretty, this is pretty much it. Because Greg Design exists outside of production, technically. sometimes he designs stuff. that has nothing to do with production, right? it'll be doing logo, it has nothing to do with the thing being built. So like, I think you're still producing it. Yeah, but it never touches these guys, never touch it. They never see it as nothing to do with anything down there. So it's like, before me or like, so right now he's doing a graphic for fan flowy, right? Which is, I mean, that's not even on here, right? Well, it is the site's being decided and well, it's just four. It's like part of would you put it under maintenance? No.
00:59:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Even if it's just straight under production, it's under production. It would stay to not send Greg information?
01:00:02 - Dan’s iPhone
No, it goes straight from you every time. Like 99% of the time.
01:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I still think it's under production of some sort. It doesn't, I don't think it goes straight under operations. Or you change it to, it's not production, it's a website or something or website specific production that Stacey is over.
01:00:52 - Dan’s iPhone
Well, that we don't design is not just websites, right? I know that's what I'm saying.
01:00:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Is that website? Site production is one thing and design is another thing and design goes under, you know, like it's attached with like finance, DevOps, legal, all that, it's its own department and then website production is its own department and design gets linked the same way that WordPress would get linked under website production and DevOps.
01:01:30 - Dan’s iPhone
It's to, it's a trick, to make an elbow. It sounds familiar but I'm not getting a visual.
01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, there's a wait.
01:02:01 - Dan’s iPhone
Wasn't an epic?
01:02:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
think it was an epic. Anyway, there's one of these, uh, it's either that or Arthur and the Visibles, but I think it was an epic. And there's this dad that gets, his daughter gets shrunk down. And so he's giant and he's hurts his elbow and like he says it like really slow, but she's tiny and he's huge and my kids for years and years and years, is randomly will just, if somebody says elbow, at least just like reenact that whole thing.
01:02:39 - Dan’s iPhone
It's a thing getting bigger.
01:02:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, your, um, chart? Yeah, because I think it's, it's fixed and maybe you have to like zoom out. But just drag it, drag those things up.
01:03:02 - Dan’s iPhone
Did you do that?
01:03:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I did that. The lines didn't follow. If I try to drag the bottom ones down. Oh, I know. Like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Yeah.
01:03:53 - Dan’s iPhone
I think Greg disappeared again. And and What if you put
01:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know. I'm thinking about like production being to the right of DevOps and then that is Stacey.
01:05:18 - Dan’s iPhone
DevOps, they're developing like, for instance, basis itself. No, if they're developing something for fan flowy, if they're developing something for perfect wedding timeline, like those things have nothing to do with WordPress. Like Stacey has not worked on perfect wedding timeline ever.
01:05:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not what I'm talking about. So I got to get through all of this to see what I'm talking about. But goes straight underneath you as the visionary and under, I mean, they're Stacey anyway, as liaison, which I don't think, I mean, don't know if she's like, maybe they're co integrators.
01:06:18 - Dan’s iPhone
He doesn't ever, she doesn't do anything with like rocks or running the meetings or like he does all that stuff. I mean, the liaison thing isn't even going to exist anymore because if I get rid of all these partners, that's like, who's there to leave his with?
01:06:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Get rid of all these partners. So like, are you not going to do strong marriage now and vinyl beats and all that stuff?
01:06:45 - Dan’s iPhone
So there's no one to talk to a strong marriage now. There's no one to talk to with vinyl beats. Like in my version of the world, like I just pay those people. Like, I don't talk to the strong marriage now people in years.
01:06:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you pay them?
01:07:00 - Dan’s iPhone
their rip So they get their rip their their profit share But I don't talk to them.
01:07:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh You pay them because the money comes into your account, and then they get their their portion.
01:07:16 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah Look So that's The partner thing is old right Glenn's gone wolf or like That's I think that's gonna be gone Does Bobby give Stacy instruction about how to do her job and what to do On a regular basis now More often than not No So so this is my thing is I don't think we're pretty like do we prioritize the hierarchy of Tasks or people
01:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
people. And I think it should be tasks or people because it's an accountability chart.
01:08:09 - Dan’s iPhone
Okay.
01:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I think that and that's where my brain has been going with this is who's accountable to who for what. But primarily, first it's who's accountable to who for what is secondary.
01:08:27 - Dan’s iPhone
So you forget it, but you have to separate the people from the role, right? Ultimately, the integrator like these people are accountable to the integrator before me, right? like Bobing talks to Abhishek and BJ once a week. I've never spoken to that and literally I've never spoken. So they're being accountable to the integrator.
01:08:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's making sure that she doesn't talk to them to know. Is Stacy accountable to Bobby?
01:09:03 - Dan’s iPhone
Me, she is, but they don't really communicate very well.
01:09:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But is she accountable to him and he not accountable to her?
01:09:12 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah.
01:09:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay then. So I'm thinking that Stacy's line is on the same line as finance operations legal and DevOps.
01:09:25 - Dan’s iPhone
Which, but what line is that? What is that role?
01:09:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so, okay, so the role in the people, this is my issue with these systems, is that you have to choose what matters most because sometimes they don't agree with each other and they don't reconcile. And I think that it's more important that it be the people and the accountability in world. then the seat first in a very small team what I'm you're saying this block up here this thing yes I'm saying that doesn't exist okay then get rid of that yeah I don't think that exists okay so then the next thing is um I think production is on the same line also as finance as operations legal dev ops I don't think operations exist I mean look at it the only thing attached to it is production so then just put that into production move Stacey there and get rid of the operations block right because these are the same yeah yeah I mean that's as it exists right now I'm trying to hold on be still one tick actually I gotta run to the back.
01:11:21 - Dan’s iPhone
Okay, I play with this then Okay, I'm ahead look You I'm just go I can of I'm go ahead and see if I can Hi.
01:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I it. I did not break it.
01:13:02 - Dan’s iPhone
Oh. I'm dead. Now it's ruined.
01:13:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not ruined.
01:13:10 - Dan’s iPhone
Yes.
01:13:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, what I'm wondering is. Okay. So production is websites. There's nothing else right.
01:13:22 - Dan’s iPhone
So is that not redundant? Um, well, the problem is. Design is not a website, right? So design has to go down there. Design is not always websites.
01:13:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. um, what I'm saying is like there's production and then design comes off of that and then new maintenance, whatever. I don't think we need to have a thing that says websites because that's what it is. Period.
01:13:50 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, but new and maintenance. Well, new and maintenance are new website maintenance website, but I'm just saying the block website goes away. Right. Right. Right. I'm going to it, technically.
01:14:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, like, new site. Right. And then what I would, I would want to see is like a line. Well, he's not a fan, nevermind. And do what I did. Okay. Does Norio ever use Abhishek and Vijay? Does Eric use them under DevOps?
01:15:15 - Dan’s iPhone
I mean occasionally.
01:15:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and also so under maintenance site, would you put Eric there?
01:15:28 - Dan’s iPhone
No, he pretty much never does.
01:15:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And new sites like who does that?
01:15:37 - Dan’s iPhone
So primarily that gets issued to Abhishek and then Vijay. Those two are like one guy. It's like they're like a duo. I don't even know who does what. I just know Abhishek's more of the PM of their thing, right? Abhishek's very organized. Yeah, yeah, I think they have. I mean, the other thing is you could get rid of Abhishek and Vijay and just call them one thing. Yes. Whatever their company is, the camera and the name of it. Yeah. You could do that because I think they also have a guy that we never interacted, but that they take the work done too.
01:16:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I think that's the thing to do. New site and maintenance site gets to be their agency, whatever it is, and we can put like a little note off to the side that agency is defined by Abhishek, Vijay plus whoever.
01:16:40 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah. So then I mean, yeah, can't put it over under here because Stacy never taught us the story of it. No more.
01:17:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there a spot for Munir on here or is he just like?
01:17:35 - Dan’s iPhone
He's just temporary.
01:17:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Consider like in the idea realm because you talk to him and that's not a permanent situation.
01:17:44 - Dan’s iPhone
You like yeah he's just temporary it's like it's a it's not permanent and it'll never be.
01:17:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, what's the difference between new site maintenance and word press development?
01:18:25 - Dan’s iPhone
Level of development. Or Eric is?
01:18:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Right now where you're at. In the production.
01:18:37 - Dan’s iPhone
Like. Yeah, it doesn't really exist.
01:18:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I'm thinking.
01:18:46 - Dan’s iPhone
Not here. Yeah. Yeah, now you're just like.
01:18:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if you can't remember that company name, which
01:19:00 - Dan’s iPhone
If you just go ab slash beach. Well, we literally call them and there you go.
01:19:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that works.
01:19:19 - Dan’s iPhone
Work. Scrap. Ah, what is it doing? Pretty great. Oh, come on. You
01:20:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How and why did the yeah, okay OK, I was like, where does this come from? All right, this seems more accurate for what we have, and also what we'll need going forward, even with podcasting and stuff like that. Like, I'm just thinking of my mind. Do we have kind of a side chart over here of what goes under what, like, what in terms of, like, the maintenance? So we just kind of have a list for an example of, like, maybe a reference point. In my mind, I'm just thinking, like, what's the list of the maintenance projects? Like the paths or? No, no, and this wouldn't be part of the accountability chart, but it's kind of my, like, the next step. And how have we already been here now? for half, but okay. Anyway, it went fast for me. But this is good. But what I would want to do, so the next step to me of the conversation, not to me, this is accomplished, and I think it's good. But the next conversation I would want to have is, okay, what are we working on right now? are those stages? kind of plotting out where you want to go for the rest of fluid in terms of the conversations with Joe, like I think it's a very fluid pace, a loose pace. But I do think that there's some identifiable potential targets, emphasis on potential, right, because there's no contract, there's no anything. But I think that our experience, especially with people like Joe, meaning Joe is a one that is more guided than guided. thing. And if there's something to be done, you're the one or, or, but what he's got Heather, though, you know, that, that puts the framework and the outline of what is going to happen up. And I think that that's a conversation to be had and something to be working on for the rest of the year. In terms of like, what is the evolution of basis? That seems to be where the conversation goes most. Come in. Hold on one sec. Okay. Like we're wrapping up right now. Just a couple minutes. Okay. So that's where I would like to be talking about things and discussing next week and just kind of at where is basis going. Again, you know, there is a pace and a rhythm to it, which is pretty relaxed. But for it to get potential and to be able to keep traction in the best way that it can without being forceful and rigid, I think that's the conversation to have is to just kind of break down, okay, what could be happening, what are we going to be working on moving in specifics in terms of a project with Joe or anything else?
01:24:32 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, got to.
01:24:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This looks crazy different. you should go do a before and after like all the blocks we had.
01:24:42 - Dan’s iPhone
There go.
01:24:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dude, yes. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, nine, 10, 11, 12 blocks compared to one account. That's at least cut in half.
01:24:53 - Dan’s iPhone
But I feel like it's cut by like 65 way more.
01:25:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's good. That's good. All right, well, my brain wants to go ask a bunch of other questions, but my mom do these any minute.
01:25:13 - Dan’s iPhone
So my next meeting is going to walk in the door.
01:25:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, then I release you.
01:25:20 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, they're texting me right now. I'm like, I'm not going to answer this text.

Are you guys here together? Can you hear me? Hello?
00:00:56 - mark sweet
You Hey.
00:01:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi, I can hear you guys. I'll hear you. Do I have both of you?
00:01:06 - mark sweet
No, I'm going to do a round then. Hold on, absolutely my mouth.
00:01:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going see you too. I'm going brush my teeth and I feel like I missed something and it's driving me nuts. I'm tired. Hey.
00:01:42 - mark sweet
Is this a home office or office office? No, it's not. The office is the one usually see it with the window where you can see the airplanes.
00:01:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, we're hardly ever on video, so I don't know. Now we've got Chona. Oh, no audio yet. Water. Oh, there. Something. Hi. I am so excited to meet you in person. Well, Zoom person, you know, this person. You're so pretty. I mean, I mean, you're gorgeous.
00:02:26 - Chona Sweet
Oh, thank you. It's probably a good idea.
00:02:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've got like three tablets, three laptops, one desktop, you know.
00:02:43 - Chona Sweet
Oh, I was drinking a crap.
00:02:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I thought that the this would be the fastest way to kind of figure out what, because you've talked about what Chona's doing a little bit Mark and like how there's some income potential there and then Chona you're just getting your head wrapped around showing up being the schedule and then also Mark has a different kind of brain those those business brain people it can be a lot so it's a good thing it's just not you know like trying to get on the same page with everybody we all think differently and very intensely so mark if you would pretend I don't know anything about anything and give me just the real like third-grade version of what you see the potential is then we can start the conversation from there yeah so there's
00:04:00 - mark sweet
three income streams.
00:04:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:04:04 - mark sweet
The first one is what I would consider traditional medical practice.
00:04:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:04:10 - mark sweet
So the doctor, his name is Dr. E, just so we're all kind of on the same page. Okay. Dr. E's primary practice is traditional healthcare pain management.
00:04:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you.
00:04:24 - mark sweet
So he is the pain management provider of multiple facilities and clinics. what I mean by facilities is hospitals, including health insurance. So he primarily bills health insurance, gets reimbursed from health insurance, and that's where he's paying employees from.
00:04:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:04:48 - mark sweet
That'll make sense.
00:04:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sort of. is my problem with trying to take notes and listen at the same time.
00:04:54 - mark sweet
So I'm just going to listen and let the AI note taker do its job. So most people who are professional, being doctors or nurse practitioners, those are the people seeing the patients, get paid on a per visit payment.
00:05:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:05:09 - mark sweet
So you get paid X amount per person that you visit, more people you see, more money you make.
00:05:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:05:18 - mark sweet
So that is in the hospital, some of it's in clinic settings, some of that is telehealth follow-ups.
00:05:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:05:25 - mark sweet
Yep. Now I'm ready to get paid the same across the board, no matter what that is. Okay. So when you generally want to go to places, we're going to see more patients, because if you're driving around and only seeing two patients at each place, you're kind of losing time on money. So let's say one facility, a 17 new people to see and one has two. Right. advertise a 17. So that's the main traditional practice. Okay. Second part is the personal injury practice. Okay. So that's most similar to what Fuji does, from kind of what you know, the difference is Dr. E. he doesn't just do consultations. He does procedures and surgery.
00:06:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:06:07 - mark sweet
So he works with a wide variety of lawyers and other doctors. So we're used to seeing maybe 10 or 15 lawyers that food you might work with, Dr. D for hours 50 of them. Some good, some bad, some in the middle. Okay. And so part of running Chona on is the medical records for a traditional practice versus PI practice. Well, they necessarily shouldn't be this way are different. Okay. Here's what I mean by that. Good enough is good enough a lot of the time for traditional practice. So we're noticing and seeing a lot of dictation service from Dr. D, where it's just dragon dictation and writing the notes. Okay. But there's a lot of typos and misspellings and some other things because it's not perfect. Which the general gist is there. Okay. In personal injury, that causes problems when you get into litigation or further on, because it looks like you're doing what you need to do. And so bringing on Chona is a couple of things. One, being able to see more personal injury patients. Two, having someone who actually can write records and reports that make sense, which is part of what I've been working with her on. There's lot of things that would get complicated and we can jump into those later. Very, very simple right now.
00:07:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, thank you.
00:07:31 - mark sweet
Now Chona can do some basic procedures as an NP, like trigger points and couple of good things.
00:07:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But... Hi, sorry, my daughter's leaving for the night.
00:07:46 - mark sweet
But she can't do things like surgery. She can assist, but she can't do the surgery itself, because she's not the doctor. So the payment structure is a little bit different in that now, legally speaking, she can only get paid for the person she sees. cannot get paid a percentage.
00:08:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, legally formal, yes.
00:08:05 - mark sweet
So we worked out a version of that that makes a lot of sense for her. And I'm assuming hypothetically speaking, hypothetically speaking, there might be a 50 50 split on consultations. So similar to like what Fuji does now where it's 400 500 visit. So split between Chona and Dr.
00:08:27 - Chona Sweet
E.
00:08:28 - mark sweet
And then 20% of whatever the procedure values are. Now procedure values tend to be much more significant, usually running anywhere between 4,000 up to 50,000 plus per procedure.
00:08:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And why would he be interested in sharing that? Because Chona would be the one who is in these patients and people that I know. And how are you getting around the legalities of that? are you creating some other kind of that kind of person, company, whatever.
00:09:03 - mark sweet
So it's a little C and thing. follow our taxes separately, like everything to keep separate.
00:09:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:09:11 - mark sweet
So I get no personal benefit out of doing this. I just get a happy wife.
00:09:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I get some personal benefit. That's not what I mean.
00:09:18 - mark sweet
Like, I think referrals, maybe, for example, Christian, honey, I think that's what people that I know. Because again, I know that Sean is going to do a good job. And, you know, a lot of issues are the same things like these pain doctors get really busy and don't do as good of a job.
00:09:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get that. That's helpful because it's a little more onto it. But when you said technically, she can only get paid per procedure and can't really get a referral fee. How are you structuring that?
00:09:50 - mark sweet
You know, there's a lot of marketing costs involved in what she does. And so more than sure, Dr. would be very happy to pay a marketing fee to help her continue to grow. I wrote for a pipeline.
00:10:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got it. Got it. Um, valid and creative. Well done. So, okay.
00:10:12 - mark sweet
Um, then there's number three because that's number two.
00:10:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you.
00:10:17 - mark sweet
It's okay. Um, and number two, number two or semison. Chona does not need doctor supervision in multiple other states. California is one of the few that she has to be under doctor supervision. So, you know, when you go to the doctor, usually see a PA or an NP, like most of the time. Um, in Washington state, she does not need to be supervised by a doctor. There are. What about Oregon? Sorry.
00:10:46 - Chona Sweet
about Oregon?
00:10:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think you need to an organ either.
00:10:50 - mark sweet
Anyway, sorry.
00:10:51 - Chona Sweet
Carry on.
00:10:52 - mark sweet
Um, but in Washington state, there's two doctors who have tried to use some of the telemed pain docs that we've worked with before. I'm just going to use footage of the exam. and they weren't thrilled with like some of the reports and just again when the pain dogs get really busy things then you get to sloppy. Yeah. And so because I'm I'm just literally friends with these people they'd be more than happy to send you know about 10 to 20 patients a week to try not just to do consults. She would not need to split any fee because she'd be off on her own without any doctors provision. That's what I like do procedures she can't do anything else obviously.
00:11:26 - Chona Sweet
I can do trigger points.
00:11:29 - mark sweet
You're not flying up to see how to do it right away. It doesn't make sense.
00:11:32 - Chona Sweet
Yeah.
00:11:34 - mark sweet
Because we'd have to find a surgery center or an office and it comes with its own liability and everything else.
00:11:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean but what if there's a good song skiing?
00:11:44 - mark sweet
You would have to find rent out medical spaces expensive.
00:11:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:11:49 - mark sweet
Jeez. Whatever.
00:11:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not saying that it couldn't happen in the future but for the short cut. No, no, no. I mean you know I'm joking obviously.
00:11:58 - Chona Sweet
But these are options. I mean again if she gets busy No, up there to go up there twice a week to go and do procedures that she can earn more for than.
00:12:04 - mark sweet
Yeah, it does make sense. The issue is trigger points only pay about 800 each, and she's going to about 450 for a console and trigger points take out as much if not more time.
00:12:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice click and do you and I know the answer to this, but I'm going to ask it anyway, have a spreadsheet with all of the income earning opportunities and that makes some basic calculations on what can happen. Then roughly how long each of those procedures or types of income opportunities take to fulfill so that you can figure out roughly what the earning potential is.
00:12:40 - mark sweet
In my head, because there's the same limitation that kind of Fuji has, she can really only see about 400 patients in a month, more than that you start paying for that.
00:12:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:12:51 - mark sweet
so, part of the benefit with being under the doctor in California is the doctor's going to be signing their reports and records so it allows her to have a little bit more flexibility and to make It's kind of like cheating, I guess, to be able to see more people, not really cheating, but...
00:13:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or you could see 400 people and try to get them to come back for other like follow-ups and whatnot.
00:13:12 - mark sweet
More procedures and things. problem on the legal side is this, because the limits are what they are, there are times where you just, even though they may need that procedure, there's not enough money to get that to actually happen.
00:13:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it's 400 in a month, right?
00:13:28 - Chona Sweet
It's not just 400 you've ever seen per person.
00:13:31 - mark sweet
Per month.
00:13:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Per month, okay. month, yes. So then, how have we covered all the income-earning things?
00:13:40 - mark sweet
I felt like we did. Those are the three for her. The only other one for me is essentially what we've talked about with Dan is building out a better software, a better way to do this. With Sime, I report writing that could get away with a lot of the issues that we're seeing like Dr. E and somebody's being Dr.
00:13:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Suffer from. I think that this Steph, me working with Chona is actually probably going to help expedite that. I'll see things that in a different way. So then Chona, let me get to know you a little bit. And now the one thing that I that stood out to me that I was that I'm kind of holding on to is that this is a fulfillment kind of thing like that you didn't really necessarily want before, but do which is like having something of your own, having purpose, not just work, you know, but like something that you're proud of, something that you that you do. But what else could you succinctly kind of summarize what was the catalyst for starting this, what were the things that were happening inside of you that made you say, I'm ready. I want to do that. is because you still obviously have some overwhelm and so not being sure about things, but obviously have enough faith and Mark and in yourself to want to proceed with this. kind of help me figure out like imagine and be there with you when you're like, okay, I am ready and I'm all in.
00:15:23 - Chona Sweet
What was that I think, I'm not sure if Mark mentioned JP, honey. That's so we recently completed more of a kind of individual coaching type service and we it basically helped me I think that'll put it me into myself that I didn't know is there or has always been there but I I just, it's just wake that, you know, passion up again from me. I feel like I've always been passionate and with my career and then life happens. I think I think after my dad passed in 2020, I lost that passion and then, you know, there's some psychological depression with that brief. And, you know, after that coaching, I just have this renewed passion, you know, within myself. And it's like perfect time, you know, when I say it's like just how it happens. Yeah, the coaching finish. And then would you say, mean, a few weeks before I finish, Mark has been talking to Dr. E. So, and then Dr. E again recommended or ask Mark, do you think Jonah would want to? I don't know if I know, you know, the background. I know Dr. E from my previous work. He's a fellow. He's a doctor in training way back in 20 I don't know, 17 2016 no 2014 2015 so he's fellow and I'm a nurse practitioner, but that's how we met with Dr. E at Theodore Sinai And then I introduced him to mark because he the moment he graduated he wanted to hire me That's one of the NPS that I'm not sure. don't want to work too hard And then I introduced him to mark and they clicked cuz they're both you know have that business mentality and Ever since he's been asking me and I said no no no no I don't do this I'm I have an employee mindset I don't think I have no clue anything about business or anything like that. And then finally, I think it's just that, you know, that timing with my personal coach and then Mark talking to him and I didn't even realize that I'll have a second or I have another job at this time. This is not part of the plan. What you mean another job? I mean not another job, I mean a different job, I mean leaving my previous job because this is a new job for me, so.
00:18:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. What were you doing before? Like were you?
00:18:38 - Chona Sweet
I'm still an I'm a nurse practitioner but more of an internist in a psych hospital.
00:18:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
00:18:46 - mark sweet
Wasn't the last what you're in, you're in a half?
00:18:49 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, the last year and a half, like I started part time with them in late 2022 while I was at UCI doing pain management and then I become time of last year of February. Then I've been doing that. Um, but prior to that, I've been doing pain management since 2013. Since I've become a nurse practitioner in 2013. I've been doing pain management. then I said, I don't want to do pain management anymore. I want something different, more challenging. And it definitely challenged me. biggest population is very challenging, but someone has to, you know, take care of those patients. Again, mental health is the taboo, still even on the medical fields, but in no one needs to help those patients. you know, it's definitely challenging. and then this opportunity arrived and then on the timing of the personal coaching, I said, you know what, not? Well, why can I see that person that can make more that I didn't even realize I can? Obviously, obviously with Mark, I guess. push gentle push like you can do this you believe in what i can do so that helps so what parts of it um excite you the most um the autonomy has always been there that's why i became an arch practitioner that's why i went back to you know getting my master's and doctors like i wanted to be a economist like that that's the driving factor and just in context i left UCI even though i'm paying good money i mean okay money i don't think i feel that they're paying me too much because they're not utilizing my full of potential and i don't like that that's why i left that job and that's why i went to the internist position which even though i'm very autonomous it's a very it's scary you know you have to always I'm back with this patient's mark is always kind of worried that I would come one time I came home with a scratch in my face like the patient do that just like no it's either you know it's a high stress environment but so you and money I mean if you're asking about that the income potential is there 100 percent I mean I'm gonna lie it's not if that's not it but it's more I think the autonomy and the fulfillment of utilizing to my fullest potential trumps the money because if it's really money that I'm talking about like UCI would have been perfect yeah I was just gonna say that doesn't make any sense that money would be even in the top because if you left because they're paying you too much and not using you then your perceived value is more important to you like I think so right Hans because remember how I would always complain that I feel like I'm um, what's that term used? I'm a glorified babysitter. babysitter.
00:22:09 - mark sweet
You're helping the residents at UCI because, you know, they're doing doctors and they don't know what they don't know. And while you enjoy teaching, it was just kind of a, you were there just to make sure they didn't screw up something.
00:22:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so money's definitely not your main driver.
00:22:26 - Chona Sweet
You, you want to serve a purpose.
00:22:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, you might like it, but if she made that decision, money can't be the main driver.
00:22:35 - Chona Sweet
It might be closed, but it can't it's definitely, there's that component of the incompotential of making what two doctors can make in a year. It's definitely there, you know, like I'm gonna lie. But if you tell me that I will be working as what I do at UCI and be a glorified assistant and not utilizing my potential, I will not be happy.
00:23:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Even if I make that much money. So I'm just gonna delineate the difference between making a lot of money and earning a lot of money. So earning a lot of money is important to you. Making a lot of money is not as much. Right. The difference is just it's slight but it's important. Mark, are you laughing about?
00:23:26 - mark sweet
I don't know, like it's nice things. I do.
00:23:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's okay. But it's still that it's not the same. When you tie how you get the money, that matters.
00:23:38 - Chona Sweet
Right. That's that's what I'm saying. That's right for me to even say I felt that I'm getting paid. I'm getting I'm paying they're overpaying yet you said because they're not doing what I'm supposed to do. I feel like that's a good feeling.
00:23:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean if your husband gives you all the things you you are that because you married him.
00:24:00 - mark sweet
So No, we're not.
00:24:02 - Chona Sweet
No, we're not.
00:24:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, we're to see you open this kind of words. Okay.
00:24:06 - mark sweet
Hey, she should make double what she's been making before. The other thing too is, when I tell Med Park, it's more and more robust. It does allow us more flexibility, but from a location standpoint, as well as, you know, a time standpoint. So if we want to travel or one of the other things for kids or whatever else, it gives us more options in terms of working time. And so it's not just a single income leader, know, anything else, trying to instill earn her income and what have you while being able from home or being able to work from wherever we are.
00:24:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:24:40 - Chona Sweet
So freedom. Yes, I like that.
00:24:43 - mark sweet
Yeah. So all these things kind of come together. And the timing was good.
00:24:46 - Chona Sweet
Dr. He's been trying to recruit her for years because he doesn't have to train her.
00:24:50 - mark sweet
And, you know, he's like, make, he's definitely more business focused, but it's kind of raining.
00:24:55 - Chona Sweet
He's all over the place. Oh my gosh. He is.
00:24:58 - mark sweet
Because he just takes on every project.
00:25:00 - Chona Sweet
which is okay but you know he needs people who can do what they need to do and so it's a great learning opportunity and she's going to have more opportunity than she would if she joined you know like any other paint tops that it would work like this procedure I've never done this before but doing procedures which I am very much this is what I'm saying like utilizing to my fullest potential although California we I still need it in collaboration with a physician but this is just the first time after 11 years of the nurse practitioner so first time I'm doing a procedure which is you know it's great it's amazing you like learning yeah yes I do I do and yeah all right so now I understand the why and the what a little bit and now we got to kind of figure out the how that works with chona so the thing and I was talking to you about this last week chona
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the mind is that the beginning is always the hardest, but what I can tell you and hopefully Mark can testify to is that when we really break it down and look at everything, what we're doing is we're going to be looking for leverage and optimization. So what that looks like is for example, you know, seeing more patients in one location, but there's going to be so many things that you're doing that from communication, travel, how certain locations operate, how you plan your day as well as how you start your day. Mark used to start it by checking his phone every first thing in the morning and get stressed out about something that went wrong or whatever, just immediately like it pumps cortisol into our bodies that that's stress of like there's something to do and I'm just like, can you just not look at your phone for a little bit and see how that goes and started working Dolce and there were some improvement. It's like the little things. It's not just the person doing business is the most important part of the business. So we'll talk about a lot of different things and it will start with a lot of questions. So the first step is you've got to get your head wrapped around everything and then you've got to be able to communicate to me enough so that I can get my around everything and so then we can start working together. So it is slow and kind of tedious and overwhelming in the beginning which is why I said you can also feel free to just vent send messages and just kind of vent because even in that venting I'll learn some things I'll learn about you know what's happening and the faster the more we communicate in the beginning the faster I'll be able to get to something useful for you. My standard It is I just talked to people once a week. Although I do tell them hey, you can reach out to me. Nobody does So it takes a long time.
00:28:06 - mark sweet
think you run in photo stuff.
00:28:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know I know thank you so much I love that doggy. I do take doggy payments Yeah, so You know something was just on your mind and you like this happened and I don't know where to put it I don't want to hold on to it You can tell anybody or you can tell me like I said you can just leave me like a voice You know you have an eye called to right Audio messengers are so great because then it does the dictation and I can just read it if I can't listen at the moment And so I will encourage you share as much as you feel like sharing Because the sooner I get all of that the faster will get there Um because I don't even know What questions to ask right now other than mark The fastest way is to get something that we can all look at so we can on same page, right, which is where, what are the offices, what are the opportunities, what are the procedures, what are the all the things. And it seems very tedious and Mark doesn't like tedious, but we can do another group call and I can extract it and I can create the spreadsheet myself. That's totally fine. But and that process actually works really well for me, Mark, because then I'm getting it firsthand and when I'm putting stuff in this spreadsheet, then I wrap my head around it. So what we could do is just schedule a couple more of these calls until I got my head wrapped around all of the opportunities to even start to formulate the questions. And you know how it goes and Mark can explain this to you is the more that we look at, the more we talk about the more that we see, the more the questions formulate, the more you just don't even know what you don't know. So it's a lot of asking questions and then it's just kind of a rough. It's not really fancy and it's not shiny and it's not exciting, but it gets some results and hopefully it'll help you be peaceful sooner rather than later.
00:30:14 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, I feel like everything is up in there. I'm getting used to the flow of the number one, the main traditional, that's what Ricky's He's going to put me because he's really all over the place. He's spread him to the food and he's about to take on a really large contract.
00:30:38 - mark sweet
He's not always going to fulfill it.
00:30:41 - Chona Sweet
So she puts her in Long Beach, which is probably busiest hospital, I would say. Sorry. like my mind no no I have to initiate a lot so like what I feel like I am he doesn't have any plan for me whatsoever I I told him is it okay with you you know being respectful I will shadow this NP you know because I want to know how they do it because the office manager which is Mark's Mary I don't know if you know her but the office manager would tell me don't do how doctor eat that because he does it may definitely you do it the right way so I have to shadow everyone else because I need to know the right way more efficient way so that's what I did yesterday he didn't tell me I have to tell him like I'm doing this is that okay with you sure that's why everything I said sure so I can see myself as my goal knowing what I'm where I am now is I wanted to make sure that the Long Beach Memorial, it will be, I will have, I want to have my roots basically there. Rather than running around, he wants to have a lot of patience, right? don't have that many right now. That's where I wanted to be. If we can get 30 patients a day at Long Beach, that would be nice. Right now, like yesterday, it's less than 20. not a lot. And I just paid per patient. So.
00:32:27 - mark sweet
So she gets between 20 to 30 a patient. So the goals between 30 to 50 patients. And there's not a limit on the number of patients she can see in the traditional sense.
00:32:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So that, all of that is really helpful. And I like that it's going to serve you really well that you recognize his shortcomings and aren't adopting that. Like that, that autonomy, of course, you would want it because you already see how you could do something better or improve.
00:33:01 - Chona Sweet
I already made a suggestion on how to increase, and he's like, oh yeah, we didn't do that, like, okay, this is gonna be a process. I feel like whatever I make decide, as long as it's obviously politically okay, he will say yes, so I have to make sure that we set up dark roots at Long Beach Tomorrow, so that we can see at least 30 a day, that's a goal.
00:33:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And Mark, how fast can you help, like you said, you know, lots of people.
00:33:35 - mark sweet
I'm holding that back until their systems and reports and processes are right because you get only really one chance at it, right?
00:33:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, your reputation.
00:33:45 - mark sweet
Hundreds of other opportunities plus my own personal reputation side into it. So the good news is he already has some PI patients coming in again from what he's doing before. So trying to cut her teeth on those, she doesn't get the same payout. She'll get like more of the traditional payout, but at least. she can cut her teeth, get under control, get the report writing right, figure out how to actually do a better job making sure patients show up because that's a huge issue for this doctor's office. Now on insurance, they're not showing up, it's actually better for him from an insurance perspective because he's paid a flat rate per month.
00:34:20 - Chona Sweet
I don't think about the procedure though.
00:34:23 - mark sweet
No, no, no, no, procedure will get a little more, but like if a patient doesn't show up to the office on the insurance side for him, he's happier, quite frankly. On the PI side, the personal injury side, that means you're not making any money, any wasted time.
00:34:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there's that follow up automation thing that we need to set up.
00:34:46 - Chona Sweet
So okay, he's not very, he's not good, his system is not good. He's hiring more people. There's a lot of non-PI patients that come that they can't get through the phone. So whatever the second income that Mark is saying with the lead, I will have to also drive that and making sure that I am calling, that you're going to have a procedure in this day and make sure you come.
00:35:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In the interim, would it make any sense to do what Fuji is doing and have an offshore kind of team that just does those calls? Because the automations will work better because we can do the text, email call, follow up and it should be cost effective. Plus, we can do all the tracking. But in the interim, without risking your reputation, Mark, and without tona having to be the one to call everybody because that is not the best use of your brain and your time.
00:35:51 - mark sweet
For the problem, we've used Dr.
00:35:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
E before in the past.
00:35:55 - mark sweet
Now, some these have been problems, which tona will be writing them and maybe in. They're okay. It took us multiple months to get signed bills and reports back from him to the point where like a lawyer sued him over and he called me to like to try to get him out of it because he opened for coaching and getting his stuff organized and set out because super busy like I not not yet he's he's going to take over the role mode still.
00:36:23 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, that he's in that mood. They keep would care about what everyone say or he doesn't have any ego.
00:36:29 - mark sweet
He's very nice person.
00:36:31 - Chona Sweet
He just wants to get paid. just wants money.
00:36:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Chaos doesn't take over the world.
00:36:35 - mark sweet
Chaos blows up the world. And the VA thing, we're getting more and more negative feedback from whether it's Fuji or other people who are using it that they really don't like the VA who doesn't know what's going on and a large accent issue. It's a great idea in theory, but I think is you're trying to scale it unless you have the right VA is a balance and issues. So because the volume for P is low. I'm going to believe we're in do everything yourself first so you know how to do it also. Oh, yeah. But until then long term that is not the solution I've shown on calling and setting up that's not the solution.
00:37:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The answer is I do it. We do it. You do it. It's the way to go. It's what I do too. Okay, so do we have other ideas for how to get more more people per day without someone having to call everybody or is that just that's what has to happen right now.
00:37:32 - mark sweet
So right now in my mind is get her feet under her for at least the next like 30 days.
00:37:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:37:39 - mark sweet
Yeah. Get in your sway. Get in going. Right now she's on prescription running power because everything has to get approved. Like you have to get what's it called for the hospital again?
00:37:50 - Chona Sweet
There's a for any doctor to anyone that can there's a process called getting a privilege in the hospital. So it's more thorough, not just background checks, just more deeper kind of employment, I guess, background checks that they do and it takes a while. So now it's been over a month now from Long Beach, so that will take a while. I'm hoping this month it will be done. Is that what you're saying here?
00:38:23 - mark sweet
Yeah, so again, we can't even really get a lot of stuff started till she's got some of these basic things.
00:38:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, that's what I was trying to figure out is like, what's the timeline? So if we spend the next, let's say roughly four weeks meeting, if you're willing to come at least for the next couple mark, because yes. So then we can spend like the next couple calls really kind of extracting the the plan, all the the income opportunities, and I'll put it in a dashboard that will make sense. So we can do some calculations and forecasting for some. potential there. And then Chona can give us that insight about what it's like on the inside, how long these things take, how efficient this process is, how inefficient this process is, and really just kind of take inventory and stock of the operation side of it. And then what we do Chona is just kind of, you know, merge and optimize operations with the financial opportunities together. And where we've got the simplest process to get the most amount of money where those two intersect, that's the most leveraged income. So again, it's a lot of gathering, but gathering from from different aspects. So getting marks kind of planned, your information, feed on the ground, and I'll put it together and organize. And then while you're getting your, you know, why you're just getting used to doing it, and we'll be gathering the data that will then help us to create this strategic plan of Okay. Here's what we do for the next 60, 90 days. Then we do that thing, right? we're observing it as it happens, kind of tracking what's happening as we're doing it. Is it going according to plan? What else are we learning, implementing and inserting that data into what we're tracking? And just, it's an iterative process. So we start with gathering information, sort it, make a plan, and wash runs repeat constantly.
00:40:27 - Chona Sweet
So as of right now, I know that I will be my native Friday. Since I don't have the privilege in the hospital yet, I would do clinics and telemedicine. So that's where I'm at right now on the traditional, on the number one, the main job, basic breath, the main job. The second job mark is holding that back until I'm ready. In the meantime, what I'm doing with that is I'm attending Choice Hall and hopefully where we can be a member soon so I can have access to their ideal note system that way I can incorporate that soon. In the meantime, Marcus is helping me. I show him my notes of the lead, the PI patient, and he tells me this is good, this is not good. And I'm in collaboration with Dr. E to make that better. But all of these, I'm going to have to drive it. It's too busy. Dr. E still busy with this. And the third one, Washington, I have yet to submit the application for what we call reciprocity. Since I'm with that, I have to, I'm licensed in California. I don't have to take the test. I just need to apply. So that's what's going on.
00:41:45 - mark sweet
Question or question of question of question of yet. If we don't do that soon or you have to have Dr. E. Vouch that you have for an active practice in California either he doesn't need to be involved with the reciprocity of Washington, like I just need to apply.
00:42:00 - Chona Sweet
and it will take a month at least to get that.
00:42:04 - mark sweet
We're seeing like three months usually in the doctors.
00:42:07 - Chona Sweet
Oh, Well, the doctors are probably different than the board of nursing. So I don't know, but it will be the board of nursing. But I feel like the Washington one would be the highest potential for income because I don't have to split that with him, with anyone. So I'm excited with that part. I thought she thinks.
00:42:30 - mark sweet
Well, maybe again, you don't to split it. So her, yes, but volume is going to be the question in the problem. Right. So if there's more volume and more procedures in California, she would make more from the California and Dr. E. Yeah, despite having a split because it all just comes down to volume. And I don't have a lot of volume in Washington.
00:42:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know a couple people, but it takes time to spread. Right. And everybody being, you know, having the same type of thought about it. we create the spreadsheet that I'm talking about, Shona, and having all of that, it's going to make all of that easier because we're going to be looking at it mathematically with just really simple numbers, and it's almost kind of polarizing when you see the different opportunities and the things that happen. So it's not so much like that.
00:43:20 - mark sweet
This too is we would still want her to do some of the traditional because it just makes everything else look more legit. Take Fuji, for example, I know keep going back to him I follow it, but he's got the Q and E work, not only makes him money but makes it look more legitimate because Q and E is generally defensive minded. So it makes him look like he's more fair and balanced. If she's doing also mostly health insurance and working through hospitals, it makes it look like she's primarily a primary trader.
00:43:49 - Chona Sweet
Okay, like how Dr. E said it when he was the post and he was asked like this is the same thing I do with my other patients. It's the standard of care. Which is where I want to be. don't want anyone do anything illegal. Dr. E and I are very much in labor. We're not going to do anything, whether the lawyer says we have to do this.
00:44:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We have to stand on our medical beliefs and what is the standard of practice that's where we're at. Good and I mean, it's not philosophy that ever comes up in Sweet Law, but one of my just kind of like principles is have an unimpeachable character, meaning that you do the same thing everywhere you go, no matter what. I will punch an old man in church if he's invading in space and they're like, I don't care. that's not a good example, but it kind of means that even when I'm in the house of God, if somebody is doing something that makes me uncomfortable, I'm going to handle it the same way. Right. you act the same all the time, you treat your patients the same with integrity, obviously honoring the Hippocratic oath and just being there. to do good, then nothing really holds up unless you're just being taxed crazily for some reason.
00:45:07 - Chona Sweet
So however much and organized Dr. E.S. his patients love him. Like he is a good doctor. Like he goes beyond like sometimes the patient is scheduled for example for epidural injections and they don't need trigger point. Trigger point is another payment. He'll waive that. That's the kind of person he is. And I'm actually, I saw it before when he's in training. I know he's a good person, but seeing it now for him 10 years later, it feels good to be working with that kind of person.
00:45:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. All right, now I'm getting a whole kind of picture. And of course, just mark over there being a nice guy with nice people and nice sweet wife.
00:45:51 - Chona Sweet
I do like and she's cute.
00:45:57 - mark sweet
I'm super excited. And so are MPs and people who run businesses too, so you know, yeah, I do I do have friends.
00:46:04 - Chona Sweet
I can I see them their growth and Although I don't want it to say I mean, yes, I see them I get jealous, but I I accepted early on that that's not the path I chose, but now I can say hey I can do this too, okay Yeah, well even in my world I'm in business and I've made people millions and millions and millions and there are female counterparts that I've made way More money than me, but I've had more time with my kids and I coached soccer and I've done all kinds of other things And that was my priority and I picked them up from school.
00:46:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got them up I made them breakfast I went to school three or four times because somebody forgot a notebook lunch or this thought the other and that was my Priority that was what I wanted to do so every night I got that twins, but you pick you pick what you want and there's different seasons in life So you're in a new season and it's fun and exciting and Mark's got people to help you out and you've got people to help you out and you're, you're gonna do awesome. I'm Yeah, I'm so grateful.
00:47:05 - Chona Sweet
Like I told him. I'm so thankful again. I feel tired today. But again, after I talk to you, I feel re-energized.
00:47:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was, I was dragging. I was like, I'm going to pass out. As soon as this call is over, I was ready to fall asleep. So like, Yay, thanks for that mark, too.
00:47:28 - mark sweet
Yeah, I mean, look, this should be good. There's a lot of options here. You know, like to have multiple fasts, not just one. I like it. Flexibility is large.
00:47:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
still want to see the doggy thing happen one day, the doggy food and doggy health.
00:47:45 - mark sweet
I know it has to make money first and be a proven concept and you're not ready. It will happen. This is something that I care a lot about. So, you know, it's about me like when I'm focused, general contestants, but like when I focus on something, it will happen. It doesn't matter how difficult it is.
00:47:59 - Chona Sweet
It happens. It's not a matter of if it's when.
00:48:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I love that tenacity. Okay, well, I don't have any more questions, but I don't know what I don't know, so I don't know if there's something I should ask that I didn't ask. I feel like this was a good start, but anybody have anything else to bring up?
00:48:21 - Chona Sweet
No. I really know my role.
00:48:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You want me to get the operations on my end so I can input it. I just want you to get your footing. I just want you to do what you're already doing, which is noticing what's working well, what's not working well, and get comfortable and then relay that information and that process back. And I want you to not overthink it. Okay, that will really stress you out a lot. I just really just show up, do your best, and know that you're going to make an impact for him, which is going to make an impact for the patient, and you're also going to be able to earn money that makes you feel good because you will know when you earn.
00:49:00 - Chona Sweet
it.
00:49:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, and just enjoy the process as much as you can. Shoot schedule. So you're gonna have to have evenings for the foreseeable future, is that right?
00:49:14 - Chona Sweet
I think, I think for right now, that's what I'm seeing.
00:49:19 - mark sweet
So, would you rather try to do a morning or no?
00:49:22 - Chona Sweet
I think the moment, like I was telling Tina, the moment I know the assigned patients to me, if I, I think once I get the hospital work done, and then I would know my schedule, like I would know how, because it's just right now, it's still up in there.
00:49:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're the only person in the world, I would be the selectable for, but I'm going to be the selectable them.
00:49:44 - mark sweet
going to the to the selectable I'm going the selectable them.
00:49:48 - Chona Sweet
don't have any, like, what I'm saying is, I feel like you have like a midday even in the clinic, there's a lunch break, but I'm saying that if I have you, two, then I can push back the hospital. What I'm saying is I can go after. Like, again, the only one with the scheduling is the clinic. If they scheduled patients for me during this time, time frame, so that would be it. But the hospital, I have no time there. I would go when I can. If I go early, some doctors go at five a.m. a.m. the patient. Like, like, I don't want to do that. mean, I'm not going to wake up the patient.
00:50:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so right now you are at the hospital every day.
00:50:31 - Chona Sweet
No, not right now. still don't have access. I don't know the moment that I get that. I'm I'm assuming. I mean, I'm not. I'm hoping it will be soon because I I did the process in less than a day.
00:50:48 - mark sweet
Mark knows and everything. Yeah, it's just we're just waiting for approval.
00:50:52 - Chona Sweet
We're just waiting.
00:50:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's just waiting at this point. Well, do you want to schedule a week to week for right now, then? If that's okay. Yeah, let's do that. So next week, I have my girls for the weekend, so I like to keep Fridays open. And the week after that, I'm traveling, but we're not going to talk about the week after that yet. So how about next week, Thursday evening?
00:51:13 - Chona Sweet
that work? Yeah, that's okay. Are you okay there?
00:51:20 - mark sweet
I just have something from four to five, but that's it.
00:51:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We don't know.
00:51:29 - mark sweet
You have to come in the evening anyway, right?
00:51:33 - Chona Sweet
Like after that, Shona? Yeah, I'm, I'm the director say evening, if that's okay with you.
00:51:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, yeah, so like six or like what time?
00:51:43 - mark sweet
I think six, it's just mark that I don't know what time mark is okay. Yeah.
00:51:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, well, we said, so I'm assuming that you're not available until evening.
00:51:55 - Chona Sweet
When are you first available and like you have time, you'd be ready for tab a call. I think. I Thursday, I should be available, again, because I don't know my schedule yet, I should be available after five.
00:52:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's what I must, you know.
00:52:12 - Chona Sweet
Okay, I'm just assuming office hours because I like today.
00:52:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so let's shoot for six o'clock and if we need to adjust it, we'll adjust it.
00:52:24 - Chona Sweet
Okay.
00:52:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so it will be the same line and we'll plan on meeting at six and I'll send the calendar invite and then next week we will talk about the following week. Okay. And so next week, Mark, whatever you need to have access to or be looking at to be able to feed me information about income opportunities, specifically, like, is actual data as possible.
00:53:00 - mark sweet
I know it's more theoretical unfortunately.
00:53:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, that's fine too. Whatever we have to start with, but my point is that if you can just have yourself either mentally ready, if you have to be at a computer, just whatever, that be able to have that type of conversation will be really useful.
00:53:16 - mark sweet
Look at your word response, Fred.
00:53:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She just has the general numbers, but who can kind of them? That's an better start. Okay, I am so excited.
00:53:24 - Chona Sweet
Trona, do you have any questions? No.
00:53:27 - mark sweet
Did she hear dogs?
00:53:28 - Chona Sweet
She has dogs.
00:53:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, what? They are not here. They are feeding with fluffy dogs. I have a poussaint. She's a poodle and a bee shan and I have a havinese boy. And the poodle has purple and blue hair dye right now because my daughter loves to be ticker to the beach and her hair was just flowing and the little kids are just like, oh it's a rainbow puppy. We love dogs. And we have birds in a bearded dragon also, so what I was a dad And the bearded dragon he's like this big and he loves to just hang out on shoulders and do you see He's I feed it with life In pics, uh, well he gets freeze dried mealworms. He loves blueberries. He loves kale Oh, Sometimes we will get him live prickets. Yeah, that's my daughter. I like lizards in the wild They're very adorable in the wild. Yes I don't think he should be in a cage. Anyway, I don't like cage down Tina is a big fan of the dog food idea Yeah, um dogs. Okay. I'm not going to cry.
00:54:45 - Chona Sweet
So we're gonna talk about something else Yeah, yeah, I'm excited for this.
00:54:51 - mark sweet
I'm for showing.
00:54:51 - Chona Sweet
I'm excited for you know the future I feel like there's dr. A like we're gonna start slow, but then there's a part of me that I'm good I'm ready to go like, you know, like, but then he I think it's in my head and I kind of verbalize it, but we'll take it slow, and it's like, okay.
00:55:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't always don't take anything slow.
00:55:14 - Chona Sweet
They go.
00:55:16 - mark sweet
It's the idea of slow, but it's not crap. This happens and now we're, yeah, we're.
00:55:21 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, the moment that he have at least 6,000 new ones coming in this October, they're already trickling in. So we'll see how that goes.
00:55:30 - mark sweet
new patient's starting in two weeks. Yeah. What? It's like 10 plus people before then.
00:55:36 - Chona Sweet
Well, let's say, and not all of them are paying patients to collect chronic pain. So let's say at least, I don't know, 30% are on chronic, have chronic pain. But basically any one of them that have pain issue, they can't, they will come to us. So, there's that, there's that new thing too that I will, my name. It will be one of the top again, because I'm paying, I'm going to to push out a lot of narcotics, so there's that too. I'm not thrilled, but I'm comfortable if that makes sense, because it's my speciality, but yeah, it's just what it is.
00:56:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good.
00:56:19 - Chona Sweet
Buckle up, lady.
00:56:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh. All right, well, I am looking forward to it. And I think just a little bit, I've been able to talk to you. I can tell that you are made of some exceptional stuff, and that you're about to be tried in the fire. yeah, but my favorite thing about it is it feels amazing to know what you're made of, but you can talk about what you're made of all day long, and you can feel it inside of yourself. Until you get tested, you don't really know. And the tests are painful, but they come with a level of conviction that nobody can shake. Nobody can make you feel less than when you've done. and the really hard work. And so I'm excited for you to feel a whole new kind of level of who you are and what you're made of.
00:57:08 - Chona Sweet
Right. Thank you.
00:57:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. The eyebrows mark.
00:57:15 - mark sweet

00:57:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

and then we're talking about do we want to try to find a building when this thing expires or do we want to like keep renting because right now the rental rate that we got for a square foot is actually really good in the other space. Does make sense to take over the entire 6-4 which would double our space and are we going to need that kind of space or we're not going need that kind of space like does it even make sense to go down that route right just logically kind of talking it out and then it became where do we see ourselves in three or five years and yeah that's where it started kind of going off the rails. That would be where the most specificity would be helpful because that's the conversation we have and I've been trying to get as I'm always trying to grow and grow and grow and compare myself to everybody. else and wanting to grow and she's waiting for us to plateau to slow like okay where is the top of it where is it and why are you constantly pushing for higher goals?
00:01:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No she has an employee mindset and you have a visionary entrepreneurial mindset that's what that issue is that's going to be an issue that is going to cause problems as long as you consult with her regarding growth. God. So you either need to keep her in an employee role and don't counsel with her as a partner of any type and decision making and growth and you need to compartmentalize her or you're going to need to just not have her which I don't think is what you want to do but something is going to have to change at that dynamic, if you're going to keep growing and evolving, and especially now that she has kids, that that would have existed already. But now she's nesting and that is counterproductive to what you're trying to do. So I had, I'll give you an example. And this is this is not the only thing. It's just the thing that pops in my head, because there's lots of different partnerships and things that pop up. I remember one time, because I worked at a call center, everywhere I worked, even when I was a teenager, I got promoted almost instantly, like within weeks. And so I worked at a call center and I got promoted probably 13 times in six years and ended up doubling my wages and that amount of time. I worked for first it was Apple and Intel. And then I went from Intel call handling to Intel network. working. And I learned how to build networks from the ground up I worked with. NASA at the Pentagon called me for tech support. It was a lot of skills that I had. but the payment like, you know, I was 19, 20, and no college because I dropped out, got rid of I lost full ride scholarships, I had two of them. And but but it was an opportunity without school to get paid to learn some massive skills, which have actually been the foundation for my business skills. And but I would constantly get promoted. So I'd be moving and having new jobs and new training, I got put into management training and certifications and all that kind of stuff. My ex husband at the time, he's like, you're first satisfied. You're never happy. like, wait a minute, where do you get that? I'm, he's like, you're constantly changing everything. Like, when are you just gonna stay in one place? that was really similar kind of thing. Like, how how do you it wanting to grow with not being happy and not being satisfied, they are not the same conversation whatsoever. Like being happy with something and being happy with the same thing next year and the year after and the year after is a completely different conversation, right? but in terms of having people who have had right-handers, know, well, I'm thinking now that that's what you call a Mary but I've had other people where they had somebody who wanted to show up in tick boxes. And this is a conversation by the way I just had with Lorenz and Patrick but it was specifically about Lorenz's team and I told him you cannot have a box ticker in your company that has to be counterproductive to sweet loss culture because those are people who will do just enough to get the job done. And the way that you work for reviews, the way that you work for the reputation of sweet law because of the impact it has on maids, box-taking will never be a powerful magnet for that. So for example, cases that hadn't been touched in two months, which shouldn't have happened, by the way. So I've got to go back and tell everyone's heater off the ball that it could have been gone that long because that's supposed to be getting cotton reviews. But, well, it did get cotton reviews. I don't remember who said they would do it, said they would do it and didn't do it. So that was 30 days ago. And but now I'm realizing he told me they're doing everything every two weeks. So he should have noticed it within two weeks unless he just, you know, what. or let them go, so that's part of it. But the issue was is that there are certain types of cases that people on the team don't touch, or they, here's the box ticking. I called, okay, did anything happen? There's no response. There's no update. Nobody did anything back. Nobody drives this case except for you, you and your team. So if you don't have a driver, it's going wherever it goes. And just because somebody doesn't reply to you doesn't mean, okay, well, I did my job because I took the box. I made a phone call. And so we had, I probably went on a rant for like 15 minutes on it between him and Patrick to make sure that they understood what the concept is and how you identify it, and that what that actually is, is apathy and complacency and cannot be, like I said, be tolerated. So anyway, there's something that you need to be watching for and Mary as well is to see if maybe there is becoming to be some some apathy. How does it show up or is it you know playing small and what can she do where that attitude can't be contagious and infect anything else in the business but you also need to know what can't she do that might infect other places in the business who could she talk to like is she going to complain because this was an issue you guys had in the beginning was talking behind each other's backs is she going to complain about marks always changing growing looking at offices every whatever like it so deciding on where you want to go is really really important and then where you going you need to make sure you've got the right people going with you yeah but first thing is deciding Where you want to go because what we were talking about last week is, or maybe the beginning of this week was, I don't know if I want to go, you know, drive, go, go, go, go, or just, you know, slow and steady or whatever, which, um, you know, I prefer slow and steady with sprints. Slow and steady because it's sustainable growth, but sprints because that's where you get the momentum and there should be some, you know, level up kind of effort happening, but it's not sustainable to do all the time. As a human being and as a company, it just, and you also can't make adjustments. imagine you're building a skyscraper and you're adding a new floor every time you do a sprint. Well, there's going to be some settling and adjusting. weight's going to change on the foundation. You have to allow. for, and this is, I don't build, I'm not an architect, so, but in my mind, right? You're allowing for the settling to take place before, and make sure it's all firm before you build the next thing. And when it comes to changing, let's see, a new system completely changing the phone system is one major change. an intake process, this call script is another thing. Like, you can't observe all the changes and see how well they're doing if you're making all the changes at the same time. So, in terms of like growing really fast, or growing as fast as you can, to grow as fast as you can, and sustainably, you got to pick, you know, one major thing, insert it, you know, implement it, and then see how it's doing, make adjustment, and then that's the new status quo, and then you build upon that.
00:10:05 - mark sweet
Yeah, and like it's never a straight line either.
00:10:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Yeah, for sure.
00:10:11 - mark sweet
It is not. Yeah, I thought ended this year would be more consistent in those hundred incidences or not. We've been kind of stuck in that mid 80 range. Yeah.
00:10:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and that's the which we know is the reason we try to get as many vendors as we can because other people are pulling your vendors and whether they're doing it with money where they're doing it with negotiations, promises, friendships. don't know, but there's a whole lot of variables that go into how you get those. How good they are at running ads, how much it costs them to run ads. have the ad platforms are doing. Are they, are they improving, you know, their ability to run ads in a costly manner? other deal that you could have, but I mean, that's almost kind of in-house, right? You've got that internal connection, but it's you having conversations around this topic that has been the gateway really to getting more vendors, getting more leads, and that is not something that you do as consistently as could be done. I don't think it's bad at all. don't think it's neglected, but, and I don't know that it could go faster. I don't know that you could do more. There's something that has to be organic about some of these conversations, but I don't know if it's always top of mind for you or if you make time for it on a weekly basis.
00:12:52 - mark sweet
What do you think? No, it's definitely in spurts, so it'll be three or four hours at one time.
00:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I mean, and that's that's something though those are friends and because of the nature of it and everything we know about it that I don't need to tell you. I don't know that doing it more often would be better, but I don't know that it wouldn't.
00:13:14 - mark sweet
Yeah. No, I don't know.
00:13:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do know that you're the guy.
00:13:22 - mark sweet
That's all I know. No, it's true. And we got to sit through a lot of them. Just even by ones that were falling up with them from there, not all of them are great. Yeah, what does that happen with that magnetic one?
00:13:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What did you say?
00:13:39 - mark sweet
Remember that magneto? I don't think that's going to come together.
00:13:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, that's Mary's husband, right? Yep. That's that's awesome.
00:13:54 - mark sweet
Yeah.
00:13:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, how much money does he make off of you every every month.
00:14:02 - mark sweet
Not very much.
00:14:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not great. We make more money from him than he makes for my song.
00:14:09 - mark sweet
Yes and no. I mean, well, we paid like two plus years from the build up this network that does get him money.
00:14:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm hmm.
00:14:18 - mark sweet
had coming out of pocket for it. We are paying all the hard costs and everything else. Okay. seats were not in. He is more than free to sell. So like we connect him to issue intake. I don't know what happened to that at the end of the day.
00:14:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What else does he do to our money?
00:14:34 - mark sweet
Oh, he's a regular job.
00:14:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much does he make at it?
00:14:38 - mark sweet
I have no idea.
00:14:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have any idea where I'm going with this?
00:14:44 - mark sweet
You?
00:14:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what can we do? He clearly has skills because Dan can do three for this month from him. Yeah, I mean, but so far as I know his costs. less than everybody else is other than the whole network set up. And last month it was like eight, like he's been on a roll.
00:15:12 - mark sweet
No, he's, this is the worst month, that's fine.
00:15:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what would it, you know, is there a potential room to explore or having him try to get leads any other way through any other platform is his knowledge transferable to ads on another platform. What would it take to pay him for that? And considering, so let's consider like, what, what if he was a employee instead and got a, just hear it all the way out because this is his first version of this thought, right? Got a salary. Would that salary not be cheaper? And we we know that he can get us some business and and would he not be motivated if like he doesn't have a great job he could work from home he could do it okay he could do it more at his leisure but also he could get side gigs if he just becomes really good at getting ads or whatever you could have him sign a non-compete or something or maybe particular types of whatever but what is another way that we can architect a deal here with him where we get some of what's clearly a good brain unless he's just really lucky but I would not say so no not at this level yeah exactly so where you could make you sweet law more of a priority and buy some loyalty from somebody who I mean I don't know I don't know what his other job is and how much he gets paid and how great it is but
00:17:00 - mark sweet
I'm gonna guess he's like 150 to maybe 200.
00:17:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let's, let's go look at Lidify and see how many retainers he sent us this year. Okay. Reports. Let's open, okay. don't want my favorites. I want to start to report. So matters, no, it's matters by state by source status. Maybe that one. Let me shift screen so we look at this.
00:17:40 - mark sweet
So June to September, was doing pretty good. It was a lot of like one, one, one for a while. I'm starting in June, it was 10, July 16, August 14, September 12, 10, remember we're at three.
00:17:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. numbers to me again.
00:18:01 - mark sweet
So June was 10.
00:18:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:18:07 - mark sweet
July was 16. August was 14. September was 12. October was 10.
00:18:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm gonna add in the three. So what is the average retainer worth to you?
00:18:22 - mark sweet
Five grand.
00:18:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that math is 325,000 since June. Roughly. That's super dirty math. know. But it's to give you a concept of could we hire him and pay him as a salary instead of by leads and then give him. So it's not free. Right.
00:18:50 - mark sweet
So we look at the voices.
00:18:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am. And then so that he's motivated to up his game.
00:19:00 - mark sweet
We're spending about 30,000 a month.
00:19:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's a lot. So that was June, July, August, September, October, six months, nine, six. Yeah, and what I, how much did I tell you?
00:19:15 - mark sweet
hundred and thirty five, I think?
00:19:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So three hundred and thirty five minus two hundred and twenty eight. So that's a hundred and seven thousand. And then you obviously have to have profit. but what if we said, hey, like, if you thought that you get us 20 retainers a month steadily through this and other means within roughly the same profit margins, would you be interested in a salary job with, I don't know if they need benefits or anything?
00:19:54 - mark sweet
No, she, he gives it to her.
00:19:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, and, but with an incentive program. of, you know, if the margins are X and the number is X, then you get this. It could be a tiered performance. So the better he does, the better he gets paid without cutting into the margin. So the tiered should also be built in your favor so that, you know, you're getting more money as he's performing well and paying him better. I have no idea. was just a tangent that we went on. But I get the thought process with it.
00:20:36 - mark sweet
not. It's worth a conversation to have.
00:20:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's really what I'm saying.
00:20:41 - mark sweet
Do you think this can do a lot more?
00:20:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so and the other, the reason I would even consider it is he figures something out. He went from one of these two Z's to the number that he has when we struggled to get roughly that amount of number from. big boy agencies. So something's happening there. And there's no way, and I don't know how to say this diplomatically and not be wrong, but Dan can't replicate what he's done.
00:21:19 - mark sweet
I don't have little to do what I would, and I hope he'd be able to do, quite frankly.
00:21:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, because of my situation, I'm just going to leave that at that. But my point is there is a powerful brain. Oh, for sure. But there's a powerful brain at your disposal right now, who is doing something everybody else that you're paying doesn't seem to be doing as consistently. Now we're three, and it's November 21st. So maybe something dropped, but maybe I don't know, maybe something's going on at home. And maybe it has nothing to do with how the market is or whatever. I don't know. It's even more reason to have a conversation because he's been doing great and now just dipped a little bit. I'm a huge fan of capitalizing on human resources in a reciprocal way, right? How can we be a blessing to you and ensure you continue being a blessing here? Also my help Mary's attitude little bit if he's like, I love Mark.
00:22:30 - mark sweet
No, she thinks both of us are stupid.
00:22:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, no. What are the odds?
00:22:36 - mark sweet
I'm pretty high.
00:22:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That you're both stupid? Really? Are you dumb boys?
00:22:44 - mark sweet
Yeah, pretty much.
00:22:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dumb boy things.
00:22:48 - mark sweet
I didn't think you were wrong. It's it is what it is. I need to jump in a different way there and keep the money component out of our economy. patients and keep her to think she's really good at which is training people.
00:23:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A compartmentalizing and keeping her in a job role that works for her. It's not a bad thing when people have employee mindsets. Where would we be without those people who are like, you just want to show up and do the job and then want to go home? I don't want to own the business, don't want all that responsibility. Those are the people that show up and run our businesses without taking it away from us and selling it to the highest bidder. We need those people badly, but you really need to know who they are and you need to, like you say, show up for them and ask of them only what really they can handle well. What we want to do is the same reason people get and stay in bad relationships is because it's comfortable and it's there. It's what in front of you, and it's a lot of work breaking somebody else in, but that is not the way to excellence, that's not the way to growth, that's not the way to even being happy in the end, no matter what it is, even if it's a professional relationship. Yeah, so, you know, there's been, you may have grown out of the relationship you had with Mary, that doesn't mean it doesn't have a place, but I mean your perspective of what she was to you, is to you, whatever your right hand, which Dan and I would both disagree with, but we both know we're not there every day. I don't know if Salka would disagree, but Salka would disagree, he's probably just probably disagreeing no matter what.
00:24:52 - mark sweet
Right, with an extremely low turnover.
00:24:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's that?
00:24:56 - mark sweet
They're extremely low turnover, it's not because we're- Overpaying people.
00:25:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I'm not saying she's not amazing and great, but but And what it was Yeah, but I mean you go into any corporation and you've got, you know, executive officers doing their job And that's their job. That's that's just all it is It's an executive officer showing up the way that they're supposed to. They're not necessarily the right hand now the vp. Yes but But VP is going to be over everything a VP of just the company right not vp of sales and vp of Whatever human resources that there's depending on how big you get, you know, this structure changes the names change the title change, but you know very rarely Does somebody actually have a right hand and when you do That relationship that they identified in rocket fuel generally is the actual one where you've got a legitimate, real-life, bona fide visionary and integrator and you are not what I would call a bona fide visionary, like I feel like you have a little bit fall on the spectrum of the integrator which is actually really good, you'll do matter that way, but it means that you don't have as much of a need to have a person that can do all the things and so you didn't have to go find one of those. You were able to compartmentalize and find different types of leaders in your organization and even create them not just me. So anyway, like I said, there's a lot more that you and I could be working on but it takes more time and digging into some of these conversations. If I could understand more of the mechanics of what Mary is doing and what Mary it wants, and obviously probably not with talking to Mary, but you and I, you explaining it well, we could probably find the, the, um, hold on a second, I'm just making sure it's not a child messing and messaging me.
00:27:15 - mark sweet
Yeah.
00:27:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the, like the ideal roles and responsibilities really were, um, but then also changing what conversations you have, um, as a result of it and not counseling about certain types of decisions. Now, you would need a replacement who would you counsel with in, in those things and make sure that, you know, who you're going to for that because otherwise, you're going to end up going back to Mary and then, and then you've now kind of encroached on, on what you had tried to create as a compartment. So we need to make sure, All of that is taken care of, but the better place to start is what do you want to build with Sweet Law in the next one, three, five years? And those are separate visions, but I would work backwards from five years. So what would you like it to look like in five years and then let's break it down going backwards?
00:28:39 - mark sweet
It's something I've been thinking about more and more, like where are you trying to get to and do I want to get to and why, by the way, make sure that why is in there.
00:28:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's your, what is the thought that you come to most often? And.
00:29:00 - mark sweet
question. in terms of the wire, in terms of the numbers.
00:29:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Period. So anything, like, what is the thought that comes into your head most often when you think about, like, where am I going?
00:29:16 - mark sweet
So this is morbid. I'm just saying that just to kind of brace you for it little bit.
00:29:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I doubt you're going to shock me because you don't know the thing my head does.
00:29:29 - mark sweet
But it's not my normal, like, thought process. Because if you and my thought process is like, I just want to grow because it's fun. It's exciting. It's way more fun than just running a stable ship, which is just running the day-to-day. there's nothing super exciting about it. more just putting up basic fires, right? Mm-hmm. difference is I think I probably have, I mean, I pray it's all wrong, but around 30 years left until I'm done. And so, More than half my life is gone. I need to do everything I can to just. maximize as much as possible in the short period of time. And. With what we do with what the risk we take. It's not. same trying to double from where we are from where I started.
00:30:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So.
00:30:27 - mark sweet
I know. I know what we do. I know how we treat our clients and it's different than everyone else. Additionally, there's this, you know, book man of. Outside funding BC money, other firms coming in. That's always kind of hanging around out there. If we get to the point where we're a certain size, we have a bit of a built in moat where we can absorb a back quarter or whatever it may be. Does that make some sense?
00:30:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:31:00 - mark sweet
And it's not necessarily coming from a place of fear. That's not what the goal that is.
00:31:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, hold on. I have to ask this before we go on because you said you need to maximize this, build it as big as it can be or something.
00:31:14 - mark sweet
was that language? Yeah, something like that.
00:31:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And why?
00:31:23 - mark sweet
So, when I die, there's enough to take care of everyone.
00:31:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who is everyone?
00:31:28 - mark sweet
Everyone.
00:31:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need you to be specific because clearly you can't be in everyone in the world. You mean everyone in your family? Do you mean everyone in sweet law? And how, what does that look like? We have to get clear on this definition. Huh? Yes, you both. Okay. What does it look like to take care of everyone in sweet law when Mark isn't here anymore?
00:31:54 - mark sweet
I don't have an answer for that yet.
00:31:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So. Let's talk some logistics. First of all, second generation wealth is almost always wasted. The people that receive it don't have the discipline and the respect and the knowledge of how to manage the money to keep what is given to them. It's almost never worth what is given to them. What is put in in order to be able to give it to them? That's the truth. Those are the stats. So in terms of providing for Chona and do you have something for her?
00:32:49 - mark sweet
Yeah, potentially.
00:32:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so we go from taking care of everybody too. Yeah, potentially. So this is the purpose though of the question.
00:33:00 - mark sweet
sounds with her because I know what's wrong. Sorry, come on, It's very nice, but yeah. So with my dad passing, you know, left money to my mom and everything else and she just does not want to spend any money on anything. So I know what's going to be left from that will be enough for my sister to be okay. You know, her house we paid for. She doesn't have huge lofty goals. She's just kind of happy with the status quo.
00:33:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, here's what I want you to do. We can either do this. Well done. You're not allowed to and I'm counting on Elon and Elon type brains. Not there really is one to like figure out how to make is like my is failing. I'm pretty sure like my kid is my pancreas like whatever my organs. I'm like, yeah, anyway, I'm in that boat of my body could shut down at any time and I feel it. So I'm not morbid. I'm just realistic, but I'm going to do everything I can to maximize and leverage it. And I'm not going to count on not being here. But every day, I'm like, let me purge this stuff. Let me make sure my files are in order. Let me make sure that everything is organized so that if I die, I'm not a burden to anybody and I leave as much as good as possible. So I'm with you on that. But you really need to define what it would be what and especially for like China because statistically women outlive their husbands anyway. And she's got a family and but I would really like you to write down a list and we can do this together. If you wanted to have a meeting and it's just you and me because this isn't a Dan thing, know. And this is more like what we're doing right now is more what I normally do regularly, anyway. There's just so much that you do. I would really like more time on it. I could do more for you. But sit down and let's make a list of like be specific about the names, specific about the amounts, specific about how you would have it managed like trust funds. What would you do? Like what would be the parameter of the trust funds so that you have a little bit of a specificity in the vision but also some peace and some targets. So then we have numbers that we know. Now, when we have target numbers and we could have target numbers for what happens if let's say something happens and you're gone and so one of the things and this is why I don't think it's morbid I had a client that I worked for and he was very he's Indian and Brainiac and he taught me so many things about numbers but he would always be like what do we do if you get hit by bus tomorrow like how do we know how to do your job and how does the company not suffer because you're not here so what happens if you get hit by bus or marry or anybody else right these are all the scenarios that we we want to take care of and make sure that we're planned for but you know let's say for some reason you're gone in five years let's say you're gone in ten years like what where could we be in five years to say that in in that five years you're in the best place possible and this is what you know you can leave in five years this is what you know you can leave in ten years So and then we kind of reverse engineer. So let's let's go with the 30 year plan, right? And you're, you're what, like 38 or something somewhere on that? Baby. I'm 40. what I'm trying to do. No, no, I know. But but I'm but I'm with you. And you know what your genetics are. There's there's all kinds of things in it. So anyway, so if we figure out, first of all, down who we're talking about taking care of specifically and what do you mean and taking care of them? And I don't mean like a number but a number that has a meaning. Could you live off of this number for how many years? Could you live off of this number and this number has enough money to make you interest for you to keep living off of as income for the rest of your life? Given this type of parameter and this house is
00:38:00 - mark sweet
You know what I mean? Like a full-on plan.
00:38:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much money? What does it look like? How is it managed? And how does the money keep making money if possible at at at a chona like family level? And then what are the other people? And and what does it look like? So for sweet law could be a severance type package that is that has to be like if it goes for sale or something like that. Like what are the ways that you could provide for your team if something happened to you and you didn't have any like runway exit, right? Like you're just gone. There is no I got to chance. So everything is already put in place. And then what we have is just kind of like a baseline number and targets. Then what we do is go, okay, well here's the target, here's the time we're doing it here's the life I want to live during that time. I'm not going to be grinding away all week every week trying to... and for death. Because you should be planning for life. The best thing you can do for people here is not die for them, but live for them, you know, live with them. And so then what we have to do is look at basically effective hourly rate of your earnings. We have to look at how does your money work for you? How does your money make more money for you? Is it just sweet law? Are there other opportunities where you could be getting that money? And I think they can, especially with the people that you know, with the interests you have, with the willingness that you have to work and the skills that you are constantly acquiring. I think that there's a lot of opportunity for you to get that very leveraged income and wealth, but you really have to choose where you're spending your time. and that includes making the time for all the fun stuff that really make it even worthwhile for you. But it starts with the how you want to take care of people and what that specifically looks like so that we can work backwards from that because if that's what you care about most is how do I leave this world. That's what I think about every day. That goes into why I have so few clients but need to get paid so much because how I want to leave this world is first of all having spent the best not crying Tina quality time with everybody that I interact with no matter how it is. And I'm not. spiritually invested into and so that's number one so because at the end of every day like if I die today I can sit there while my eyes are closing and I'm on my way out going this is what I did that was good today and this is the lives I touched I didn't have a fight with anybody I didn't say bad things I didn't put hate into the world I did what I could to organize and to reduce burdens to increase them you know those types of things so it doesn't matter when I go there's not going to be any regrets that's one of the first things so in my architecting it's no regrets make sure that every day is spent in a way that's no regrets so that affects my time my energy who I'm spending it with and then the next thing is the finances like making sure that I'm not first of all never in a situation where I'm worried about money, which you know what I that experience, like I got to handle it because if I'm worried about it, then I'm thinking about it and being obsessed with money. And that puts me in a terrible mood, which means my experience is my first priority, which is the interactions I have with people every day. That suffers because my brain is somewhere else and it's in trouble and it's in stress and so it can't be in love and it can't be in encouragement, you know what I mean? So think about that would be one thing that you could do also. So what is the long term like when I leave this world, if I leave it, you know, years from now, decades from now, how would I like to leave it? But if I get called today, what can I have done today to make sure I'm not going , I wish I had not done this or done this differently. But then no matter what you do Mark is long as you are on that path every day. I Can't guarantee it because I haven't died yet, but I have been on the threshold several times. I Know what it feels like to know that your life can just slip out of your body I've been not close to death with illness so many times and I Do know what it feels like then just to be peaceful and just look like yeah, I did as much as I could up to now so That will help you with and but what I can tell you too is the correlation to how I run my business You can't really even call it that because technically it's just a glorified job If I don't work it doesn't work. There is no money. So it's a job, but But the way that I plan it is around that and not the other way around So, no, I don't think it's more of it. think it's great. think that solving that problem and being clear about what you want that to look like will help answer all the other questions I've been trying to pull out of you with more ease. And I also think that, I don't know, there's something very liberating about being able to look at it that way because, and you're already getting into this. So, think that you've kind of been doing some of this on your own, whether fully consciously or partially, but you can put things in perspective and realize, okay, this is good. I would like it to be better, but here's, this is good. This is good. is good. you know, basically good enough, but I want to do better. Like, there's this simultaneous kind of like, it's not even vacillating back and. between one, but it's like, it's not a hamster wheel, but it's almost like this circular thing of it's good enough for this moment, but it can be better.
00:45:12 - mark sweet
So let's keep going. You know what I mean? Yeah, like, this is fine. I'm okay with this.
00:45:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or today. But tomorrow I want more and and not in an obsessive angry. I'm not satisfied with what we've accomplished or like, not I don't appreciate what's been done, but let's not lose momentum. Let's not waste this day. Yeah. That would be a great place to start. So do you want? All right. So next week, we're not having a Monday meeting because I'm flying. Did we reschedule that? I think we said we're not doing it because Dan's not working next week.
00:45:55 - mark sweet
It's Thanksgiving week.
00:45:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yeah. But we will meet
00:46:00 - mark sweet
Second, I'm not meeting with you guys. I think the way what? Because I have that AI conference on the third.
00:46:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. And trying to I cross that off on the 25th. Wait, no, that's Thanksgiving. OK, that's right. OK, so on the second, we're not meeting. Did we move it? We did not move it.
00:46:24 - mark sweet
I will be back on the fourth at some point. So the fifth Thursday, the fifth is totally fine.
00:46:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it'll be a long day. Well, I really hope that Chona and I can move that call permanently.
00:46:41 - mark sweet
So I would be meetings are hard.
00:46:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But Thursday, I can do Thursday or Friday that week. And if Dan can't, you and I can dig into this stuff more. You want to pick something?
00:46:55 - mark sweet
Yeah, that's fine.
00:46:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, December, December 4th. It's my oldest daughter's birthday, and I will have been, roll this into me. This isn't about that. I'm telling you something. Sorry. On December 4th, I will have been a mother for four years, 24 years, 24 years, years. Yeah. Speak to you. Okay. Anyway, especially because I had a miscarriage before every single one of my children. I've been pregnant 10 times. have four babies. I worked for them. They were hard. All right. So Friday or Thursday, the only call I have to do is my 12 o'clock with Dan. And then as of right now, I still have Chona at 6 p.m. Friday, I don't have anything at all. They're totally fine.
00:47:45 - mark sweet
There's an interview before or after Dan, whatever like to keep that open. Yeah, that's totally fine.
00:47:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So let me move you. and if Dan accepts then yay and if not he'll just be you and me after that he'll be back to normalcy yeah okay well then we still have christmas week oh i don't think that that's going to be a problem for me actually i don't know about you guys well on december 5th you might have to move and time it later because i'm going have a small time change during the 16th and 23rd but small time change yeah oh we're in japan oh okay yeah that's a big time change well no not for us specific um it's a 17 hour time change oh well but it's it's fine because the new one is like just early morning there and it's fine yeah okay um so december 20 Third.
00:49:04 - mark sweet
The 16 and 23, we'll figure out. The twelve should be fine. If there's some issue, I'll let you know.
00:49:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The twelve.
00:49:12 - mark sweet
The sixteenth and twenty third. You mean it?
00:49:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Oh, the 12th. M you mean. Yes. I thought you said 12 doesn't like the date. The 12th of my dude. We don't mean on the 12th. Okay. All right. Well, we'll do all of that. as it comes up. Okay, so I'm just looking at some of the stuff that we've been doing. Did you do any more research on the gift boxes since we talked about the monthly subscription thing?
00:49:55 - mark sweet
So yes, I also talked to a couple of different doctors that I'm. fairly friendly with just kind of pick their brains of what they would like. It's interesting that the smaller ones are like, now the doctor makes the decision. The bigger ones are like, yeah, I know the front desk like hands out cards. So, not surprisingly, we're gonna have to think about who gets what.
00:50:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:50:18 - mark sweet
The one that was like, yeah, look, I would love to just get wine in the mail. Like, I'm stoked for why. No one is like, we eat healthy, like, I would like fruit and then staff would like fruit. The ones like girls in front like, I don't care. So it was helpful, not helpful, but helpful. All of them kind of report the same thing of in the last three years, they've seen the number of things they call unattached, basically unrepresented clients way down compared to what they saw three years ago. And the ones that they are seen that are unrepresented are not cases we would. Take.
00:51:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is doctor's offices.
00:51:10 - mark sweet
These are chiropractors.
00:51:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay.
00:51:15 - mark sweet
And those are the ones who really target me. Like I love Fuji, right? Like we love working with him, but the chance that he comes across the case that doesn't already have an attorney attached to it is super low unless it's a personal friend.
00:51:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So where are there other doctors that might. Yes. Okay.
00:51:39 - mark sweet
But there's a lot of them that will want things for that. Yeah. That I am not getting near. I understand it's legal in Arizona. I'm still getting near.
00:51:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like ER doctors?
00:51:57 - mark sweet
Yep. want another super fun car? and somebody will pay that. Oh, yeah.
00:52:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you can't really compete with that or won't compete with that. Okay. Well, Dr. Rufundrels want a huge thing. They're not, but I don't just need things. Sorry, what?
00:52:27 - mark sweet
I would love to find a way to increase that. mean, we're at one Dr. Rufundrel, this one, that's low. And so if we're sending so much business out, I mean, there's plenty of people who say, you know, look, for every two I send you, I'm expecting to get one back. But the quality of those cases usually aren't aren't there.
00:52:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:52:55 - mark sweet
So I'm just trying to find other ways to generate cheaper cases. a lack of better term.
00:53:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:53:03 - mark sweet
And there's, you know, other benefits that the doctors always like you're going get your bills and reports faster, we can ask for certain things like, hey, can you squeeze in this patient or whatnot, you know, things that if you don't have a good relationship or, you know, we didn't pay them well. I'm sorry, I can't, you know, put that person in say we're full.
00:53:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:53:26 - mark sweet
So it's more just constant process and constant ups and downs. And it's always how it's been with these different, you know, providers and vendors, but we've talked about it before, we've gone, we've done stuff, we haven't done stuff with how can we keep putting it.
00:53:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
if you found somebody like an order we are downer that worked? I don't know if they could do this or not. Worked at the hospital and paid them to rock their car with your stuff.
00:53:56 - mark sweet
So it's a little little tricky. Because you are not supposed to solicit clients at a emergency scene, if you will, directly. And directly is the key word, because the TVs that are on an emergency room have lower ads on them, right? Right. There's bus benches outside the hospitals, which have lower ads on them. So it's not impossible, but it's, uh, it's right. It's online and it could work. I'm not saying I can't, but, you know, what's the difference in hiring a jam to do that or just, you know, buy a junk car and just park you there every day?
00:54:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's going to get towed and, you have, it has to have a reason to be there parking is usually not right out from where you'd be able to see it. But, like, depending on what the major hospitals are, is there a fast food place or something? where you could pay one of their employees and to wrap their car and so it gets seen frequently by people in the vicinity who just visited somebody who were in the hospital and got in a wreck and like it's really just top of mind and where are people from the time they get in a wreck to the time they get represented but represented where are they wherever they're at that's where you want to be but it doesn't have to necessarily be the same places that everybody else is like how can you think outside of the box a wrapped car like thoroughly wrapped could say a lot could catch a lot of attention and you do that at times a few around hospitals not in them not on the parking lot but in locations that are close to it where people might even be stopping or people visiting might be stopping like you know what I mean like is in a high-pop We did area. The fact that the chance that that doesn't get you a case from time time, know, buildings, you know, why else would you be doing that? Right. Yeah. So, I mean, and that wouldn't cost that much. Really, like somebody's driving their car anyway. And you pay for the rap, whatever that costs, you know, maybe $1,000. And then you pay them to drive it and say, well, I'll pay $500 a month to have your car wrapped. And then how many times could you do that? And basically have a walking advertisement that's going everywhere all the time with your ads on it. And it's moving. And if you're talking about a fast food worker, guess who they're around all the time. The poor people that need representation if they get in the break. And probably the ones are likely to get in Iraq, lower income, more drugs, working later nights, driving while exhausted or intoxicated. It's just it's the status quo. It's just that's that's just the reality of it. I'd try it. I put my knee in it.
00:57:25 - mark sweet
Yeah, no, it's worth trying. We tried the LED trucks. I don't know if you know it at all.
00:57:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's an LED truck.
00:57:33 - mark sweet
They're a box truck covered in LED TV.
00:57:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I'm going to go around sporting events.
00:57:40 - mark sweet
Huh, never generated. But I keep doing it. So that way, someone said I saw you in the billboard or saw you when I was driving. And they really maybe thought someone else that has a similar name hypothetically. I got to do those. I don't know where they saw it. Right.
00:58:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but in terms of like where to run ads, where to put ads with their physical or digital, where are people going from the time they get in a wreck to the time they get represented? Yeah. And is the time of representation window decreasing? Probably is based off of what you just said. What was that window? What is that window? we know? And what does that mean? Why did it decrease? Are people more aware?
00:58:44 - mark sweet
people? Awareness has definitely gone up.
00:58:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For sure. And it will, and in this, because we live in an information world, right? social aspect of it means people are telling their stories and other people are learning from other people. stories and so they you know maybe they didn't know a brother or uncle or somebody in their immediate family but because of Facebook they know somebody that they don't even really know but now they're like what I know how to handle this because um but even being I mean driving how many billboards now or ball from billboards well can you can you run ads in and on podcasts are there podcasts like true crime podcast that freaking so many people huh yeah the geotarget the what target do you target you wouldn't want to add right no right but big podcasts might do geotargeting ads geotargeted ads that um you can get multiple platforms too so you know we have not talked about that that's not traditional radio I wouldn't consider it traditional radio because of the the social aspect of it. And I think most people aren't going to skip a really short ad like that. don't think you can in podcasts. Yeah. Are your competitors doing that? You know, I don't know if they are, but I would imagine the majority of them aren't yet. I don't think that podcasts have been topped very well, but they're going to keep growing. So that's something to look into. If you know what is the highest, you know, time, like when do the most accidents occur? What time of day? What day of the week? Run ads then or right after those times.
01:00:45 - mark sweet
Yeah.
01:00:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't got we haven't. I'm going to put this on that list.
01:01:03 - mark sweet
2020, which is pretty outdated at this point, found that lawyers spent 400 million on just TV commercials.
01:01:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
On just TV commercials? Yep.
01:01:18 - mark sweet
And then data from sensor towers, so take all that with a large grain of salt, and Morgan and Morgan spent 40.3 million on digital ads in 2023. Oh, sorry. 240 million was just what Morgan and Morgan spent.
01:01:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's? I'm sharing, you know, the thing is, what should I... spreadsheet. I showed it you. was working on earlier this week. just shared that with you. Identify what the time accident to represent.
01:02:43 - mark sweet
Look, everything's worth a shot. We tried the radio thing. That didn't work. Radio clearly works to someone, but didn't work for us. Things are worth trying. I know podcasts usually are
01:03:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so I shared this talk with you just so you can just, like, if there's ideas that you have and we haven't talked about it, you can put it here, put it in the parking lot, and if we're, I'll put things in progress if we're working on it, but we'll get a little bit more organized and structured and then think about whether not you'd like to meet one more day a week so that we can just put, we can just be more structured, that we can get more results, there's a lot of things that have to be solved that only you inside of your company can solve, you don't have another person that's there doing this. There's just a lot, like, you have a big organization there's a lot of opportunity, there's a sufficient amount of risk, there's enough systems, there's enough departments, like there's a lot to be done. And I don't think you really have anybody leading any of it super well. think Mary does her part. I don't think that's nearly enough. So another hour a week, you know, if we did that for six months, we can make them significant momentum, I think, towards things, but it really should start with first. What does it look like to take care of everyone? Who is everyone? They need to have names or a very distinct description, right? And if it's everyone at Sweet Log, if they're all the same, if Mary is her own, you know, be really specific about the people and the categories of people because how you take care of them should look different, right, for all of them. And then we can like, okay, what does that number look like? Where are we at now? What's the gap that we have to bridge? How long would it take us to get there? And then we run every decision that we make through the filter of does that slow down our goal? Does that speed up our goal? Does that get in the way of it? Does that aid it? Take us off track? Any of the things? So start there and this is a good time of year to really be pondering that type of stuff. Naturally, people become more introspective this time of year. So, which is probably what's what's already happening with you it just it just does winter that you guys don't really have it but but it does it we have less sunshine that's a real impact um but the holiday is coming the end of the year closing you know there's there's a lot of different signals that we have that we may not have personally and purposefully given energy too but we're affected by them anyway so anyway it's just a good time to capitalize that while you're on some walks maybe um and if you get some thoughts maybe you can leave yourself an audio recording or you can drop me uh audio message or something like that and just kind of bring down to a text or signal or wherever or and no not signal if it disappears uh audio text though and uh let's let's do some planning and reverse engineer from the things that matter most at the life level because business is just a vehicle to get you there. Yep. I need to wrap up because I gotta go check on my little pole and get some stuff going but what's that?
01:07:22 - mark sweet
I'm gonna head home, it's only office.
01:07:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yes. What it was like a baklava hamburger.
01:07:29 - mark sweet
What was that? Uh, so I just got followed up so they make like maledo cups.
01:07:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You did that? Mhm. Did you just tell me you did that?
01:07:41 - mark sweet
I didn't eat followedo. I bought the pre-made followedo and I made ground beef with.
01:07:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You cooked?
01:07:47 - mark sweet
Yeah, I can cook. China can't cook. I can cook.
01:07:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no, We know that like this has been since day one like this is not a surprise. Not like I thought she could cook like. Yeah, no. Love that that's funny though. Okay. Well whenever I come with me you guys you guys are you're making me dinner. So there All right, well head home, and I I'm not worried about it, I do think you know she's in a new season and Mike and And It's important to take that into account two kids changes you two kids and settling down with a man changes you and But I think those differences were already there that it's just the gap is getting bigger and it's okay we just need to create the the proper dynamic and then encapsulate it and let it let it stay there and It will create happiness for her and you and she'll still be useful, but I I do think that the the The way that you identify it probably should shift a little bit. I really can't speak until we have a much more in-depth conversation about the logistics. With the one hour that we have and how much we share of it with Dan, it's really hard for me, again, with the size of your organization and all of the moving parts to basically I get half an hour a week with it and it's just not enough to be really effective. So that's, I'm not going to be looking for any new clients, I've got all the things that I'm working on, but I would give more time to sweet loss.
01:09:39 - mark sweet
Were you able to hire that one person that you were trying to hire?
01:09:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, but she was just not able to be consistent and reliable anyway, but what I did do is partner up with a lady who's been around as long as I have and so it's really kind of fulfilling and satisfying. I'm home by myself all the time, and I'm waiting. social for that. getting to have her has been has been helpful too. I'm still not in the surplus that I want to be, but I don't think I'm very far from that. So I'm glad for that. But yeah, that was just another reason I just I don't want different people. I got so blessed with the amazing people I have. If there was somebody just, you know, a magical fit. I'd work with them, but like I really particular about my people and I've just kept them a long time and I'm not looking for anybody new, but to be able to serve better and definitely be down for that. And and I have not been able to do what I wanted to do here anyway. So when you're ready for it, I want to do I think that there is so much more structure that we could put in place. And I also think that I could help with the mental load that you have and help you do than things more consistently, because we do have so many things that you're doing constantly. I don't think any of it is getting done as well as it could be because you're so divided.
01:11:16 - mark sweet
Yeah, no, definitely more the key directions.
01:11:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Plus, Mark calls make me smile. So I like how I would have more of that in my life. I think it's a thing. No, you always make me smile. You also make me annoyed sometimes.
01:11:32 - mark sweet
That's OK.
01:11:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do the feeling is mutual. You don't have to.
01:11:40 - mark sweet
I just to just want to bring it better. that's what everything just comes down to. And you know that about me when I get frustrated with my reality.
01:11:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I wouldn't want it to let like if you were not, if you were any way, it wouldn't be real and I have no interest in that. Like if you don't get frustrated, that means you don't. about it. So I don't have no interest in that either. think you do great. I think that you're awesome. think everybody that works with you is lucky. I think your chona is lucky. think you're lucky because she's sweet and smart and funny and feisty and she'll keep you on your toes. your kids.

THE POWER OF GOOD QUESTIONS: ============================ Someone asked me where I got my knowledge from. It caught me off guard. He mentioned that I reference “a lot of books” … but I only started reading books as an adult about three years ago. And with four kids, I think I’ve had time for about fifteen of them. Really, my knowledge comes more from asking questions. In fact... ----------------------------------- If I had to pick the one biggest “power move” I’ve had throughout my life, it would be asking good questions. ----------------------------------- There is TREMENDOUS power in moving a person to think specific thoughts. QUESTIONS MAKE PEOPLE THINK SPECIFIC THOUGHTS. Human nature is such that if a question is posed to a person, they will ALMOST ALWAYS WANT TO KNOW THE ANSWER. They may not SHOW interest… but the question will hit their minds (if there’s any light in them) and their minds will wonder, even if momentarily, what the answer is OR they will answer it. --- IN CONFLICT --- I used questions to get out of beatings. I had between the time a hand was drawn back from the time it hit my face to ask a question that made my mom think about what the consequences of hitting me would be, or why she shouldn’t do it. Like “what do you expect me to do when my example is “abc” … what else could I know?” The strikes would lose their venom… and I would get hit with words instead. Word battles I stood a better chance with, at the time. --- IN SCHOOL --- I used questions to get better grades in school. When the teacher wanted to regurgitate a book out to the class and leave us with little other information… I raised my hand incessantly to ask the same thing from five different angles. I wanted to understand the CONCEPT AND PRACTICAL APPLICATION of everything I learned. Why? ⇐== question :) Because those sneaky buggers liked to put things on the test that looked nothing like what was in the book. Because I understood the concepts, I was able to solve problems and answer questions well. --- IN CORPORATE --- This was less appreciated here than it was anywhere else. During management meetings in my early twenties, short meetings were often extended because I had a lot of questions. I was not a favorite. I wasn’t trying to be. I was trying to get a promotion every quarter for six years. But that’s not really my biggest win. My biggest win was a TEAM win. While, in the beginning, NO ONE appreciated my questions… in the end, MOST did (the rest didn't care about their work and I didn’t care about them). Here’s why. I understood our needs better than most. AND… I understood our RESOURCES better than most. I worked in a tech support call center as a technician then moved up to account manager. We managed top of the line tech firms that everyone here knows very well. COMPETITION WAS BRUTAL. We were constantly being threatened with losing our accounts to the Philippines or Costa Rica. This was a huge employer for my community and probably the only “Desk job” for the entry level workforce. The threats flowed downhill DAILY. Threats of being terminated. Watching people get fired frequently. Yelling, tension, things that are not legal. Given my history with violence (a slap in the face was the least of it) … I wasn’t a fan of threats or not having power. So… I took all my knowledge acquired from asking my “annoying questions” and created a system that would save us for years, and that the company ended up adopting worldwide. Our biggest problem was not meeting metrics. There were two main factors for that… Lack of tracking and lack of staffing due to lack of tracking. So, I created an excel workbook that I would export multiple Lucent reports into. I created formulas on each sheet to tabulate the data I needed. At the end of the workbook, I combined that data daily, weekly and monthly averages plus a forecast for the coming week, month, quarter and year. I updated my reports every morning before I got to work. Instead of waiting for clients to ask for our stats, I started sending them to my boss who could send it to the clients. #JobSecurity Knowing the stats in real time and historically made it easy to see our trends and fix them. Back to my goal for the hard work… I doubled my salary by the time I left, receiving my first promotion within the first two months and many more after that. --- IN HIRING --- Another part of my success was my hiring practice. While the company had an attrition rate of 70%... My attrition rate was 30%, and almost all of those were due to people transferred onto my team that I did not hire… OR… to promotions, because I hired quality people. My process only varied from others in one thing… questions. I asked more of them. I asked technical questions. I asked situational questions. THEN I SHUT UP AND LISTENED. There is a LOT that you CAN NOT ASK in corporate. However… if you let a person alone with enough awkward silence… they will often fill that space with talking, and tell you things that you WANT to know but cannot ask. AWKWARD SILENCE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE TOOLS. I can hang with it all day long if it serves my purpose. Which brings us to… --- IN SALES --- Questions are so powerful in sales. Questions are how you get a prospect to CLOSE THEMSELVES ON A DEAL. Seriously. If you’ve asked yourself enough of the right questions to identify your ideal prospect and you know you have the solution for them, asking them the right questions will be very effective in helping you close the deal. What kinds of questions, you ask? (Good question!) - You ask them about their biggest pain points. - You ask them how long they have been dealing with it. - You ask them what else is suffering because of that problem. You ask them how they’ve tried to solve it. If they never have… there’s a good chance they never will, and why would they let that continue when you can solve it for them? If they have tried and failed… well… you know why they failed… and you can solve it for them. >>> But you don’t TELL Them that. <<< You ask them if they have tried doing something you would do for them. Then you wait for that tone that says… No… but that sounds like a good idea… I wonder if… And then you ask them if they’ve tried something else you would

Hello.
00:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hello.
00:00:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What's up?
00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not my energy levels because I've been getting up at 5.30 in the morning for the last couple days because I have a seminary student now.
00:00:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You have a what? Seminary. oh, oh. I thought you said something about a son. I'm like, wait, what? have a son in love. I thought you were going to say to jump into your ice bath and then expose yourself to sunlight.
00:00:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, you're not.
00:00:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Never. You're not doing that.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm using myself.
00:00:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no.
00:00:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I was like, wait a minute. Never no matter how many times that should tell me it would be good for me and a rim hop and blah, blah, blah. No, never.
00:00:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I've never done it.
00:00:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me, I want to send this to you. I'm texting it. These are my past clients, current friends, very smart people who are
00:01:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
um they used to do before covid they were agency um and for yoga studios and amazing like they spent a little bit time creating marketing campaigns and they blew these brand new so it was like um great the guys that make smart tools are your clients yes oh that's funny i know david what's his name bought this and met like no as a customer oh yeah yeah he met them at the high level event he met Jason and chandel uh i believe so yeah and i think he's a subscriber so but mostly his daughter is the sort of the face of that but yeah when david and her went to uh Austin i forget where the where the thing was but yeah he he was so funny he goes i met the number one affiliate for high level and i go uh cooch and he goes yeah um Did you know that? like, I know him. I've known him for years. He's like, that guy's the number one affiliate. I go, I didn't know that. I know he was partners, maybe with the number one. Anyway, David's a subscriber that Jason also had, uh, he had this one thing that it to no longer needed, but I almost bought it be. I mean, because there's somebody else that does something very, very, very similar. I'm a subscriber of the other guy. I'm not a subscriber of Jason. David's a subscriber of Jason. I'm a subscriber of, uh, the other dude. can't remember his name, but I use power tools or something else like that too. It's very similar. Yeah, I have that one. David has, David has Jason and David matches.
00:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So Jason's a beast. He's super tall and she's really short and they always did video even though Tina never did. I'm really good about it now. And she used to be a hairdresser. And they. They used to do media buying, but they did all the campaigns. They created all the marketing and really just the whole growth business plan. And then they did the ads and they wrote the copy, they tracked everything. And they did amazing for these yoga studios that then COVID came and shut everything down and went to here. But Jason, they're both brilliant. Chandel loves the systems and the marketing. Well, he loves marketing too, but so he loves marketing and the tech. And he is really brilliant at creating the tech and snapshots and creating the automation and she loves the marketing, but does the customer support, the hiring, the deadlines and all that other stuff. and I've watched their kids grow up and yeah, anyway, but you know, to me, they're kind of like under the radar, but although I've I mean, their group is just growing.
00:04:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And I see people in here that I know that have done a good job. He gets called out fairly frequently in the main group for a couple of his bits and pieces. Oh, does he? Oh, yeah, yeah, for sure. That's awesome. Yeah, right. you're saying, hey, man, the other guy.
00:04:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're like the two go to the tools. got, oh, wait, wait, wait, okay.
00:04:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Because I'm like, no, it's a wife. Okay, I just want to make sure I don't save you. Yeah, I can't think of the other guy's name, but yes.
00:04:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I think I got their stuff and they offer like, they call it like white glove service or something like that, where you don't have to do anything for your people and they'll do it all and.
00:04:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, no, that's yet another guy. Yeah, that's like, it's Stanley. There's two of those.
00:04:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's fine. There's like two of everyone. Well, what I love about these two most is that, I mean, they're just super smart. And I don't know, like Jason just gets excited about this. But he has the balance of Chandel, who is like, okay, but we need it to be this and just kind of whatever. And they also have Tina thoughts in the back of their head, although I'm telling them, okay, don't do this, don't do this. I think that's fun. So anyway, but like, as far as like collaborating type, they're just, they're, they're mom and dad. They're at hockey games all the time. He cooks like crazy, amazing food. She was an air dresser, so she still loves all the beauty stuff. Anyway, they're just so laid back down to earth and they're in this world, but they're not schmuckery's like, just, you know?
00:05:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
do. Yeah, because I think that, you know, the good thing about high level is that the people that got in early, like then, like a lot of these tools providers, the early onset people, they were solving real problems. With real solutions, and now you have the hacks coming now you have the this Not just the bang whiz and you're like okay, whatever and it's someone that's been using high level for like a week And they bought some of our snap shot. No reselling it Thank you. Yeah, okay No, thanks Oh God now what happened Do that again somehow the audio button is just like Below my browser cuz I'm not looking at zoom.
00:06:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was behind my browser, but apparently it was just underneath it and so I was clicking Anyway, they had given me a high level account, but she was like tini you should just really have an agency account like Okay, I didn't think about anything. I'm like I just don't even want high level whatever But now that you're talking about it, and I know and you got that one snapshot. I really do think it will be in my best interest to understand this for I just see their growth like I was turned off by the whole Frankenstein code. Yeah, but what I see now is almost like I'm trying to think of the word but it's like socialism. Like I mean open sources Frankenstein code, Franken code basically all the things that are built off of it and so and also I'm telling myself there's no first of all I don't like anything being housed under one roof but this really isn't that because let's say high level did something really stupid and just blew it up whatever there's now this whole community of people who for sure even if they're not coders have coders who can very quickly pivot and splinter off a whole lot of related things because we're all now having thoughts we've never had before, it used to be owned by an entrepreneur or an infusion soft, and you couldn't compete with them. And now this is like a building full of all of the greatest minds helping to build it. so it doesn't feel as much of a death wrap is like, anyway, something else.
00:08:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So only way goes sideways. And I'm not sure it can even go sideways, but what will be inevitable.
00:08:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And for those of us that have been in the game long enough, it's like in a huge, a huge enough.
00:08:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Remember when everyone was an infusion soft affiliate? Oh, is same thing's gonna happen here. Eventually that affiliate play no longer exists and they get rid of it. And then that turns into we're gonna raise the price.
00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yes.
00:08:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, that's it. Here's down the road, right?
00:08:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know. because the pace of everything is exponentially faster and increasing. I don't, I don't think that timeline.
00:09:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I see them doing it right now to through these add-ons, right? So a perfect example would be their, their, I think I'm not exactly sure what the relationship is here. So they have the conversation AI add-on. It's not have gone too deeply into this. It's not clear to me if it's theirs or if they have a licensing deal with someone else and it's, it's that. But either way, that add-on per account, 40 bucks.
00:09:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's huge.
00:09:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. That's a huge markup. That's a huge price. I even know what the markup is. So I see them doing that. Like they, they create certain add-ons and that's actually a way to get more money without raising the price. I'm like, they can do that too.
00:09:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I see that. I mean, because that's what everybody's doing is talking on to it. So anyway, but bottom line is I definitely do want to get into it and learn it because the one thing I do know is that somehow I'll think of a question somebody hasn't thought yet and then they'll be a day on and be like, you'll have a thought. There's no possible way I would think what you think. I cannot even come close to the things that you think. But when it can be as a catalyst for you thinking what you're thinking, I'll do that. Check it out. Yeah, so did you push that button yet?
00:10:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I didn't, because when I went to push it last night, my browser would not cooperate and I'm like, I'm just going to shut this computer off.
00:10:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is a sign that today is over.
00:10:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I couldn't even close the time. oh my god, I'm going to close this time. But I will set it up right after this fall. Because it's Thursday, and it's Paul's day. It's Paul's in random tasks day.
00:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so there you go you know what i don't know if you would ever need it like i need it because i do but i do so many different things but you do so many different things and it is this extension called work on i'm sure i've told you i've used it yeah i use it religiously do you i i didn't see the i always have two browsers open and they're color coded because they're each in different google accounts which just makes it easy because i always have two i always have my mission tab open constantly because when i get a few breaks it and also it just serves as a reminder hey i've got to go get some work done there yeah so feel 12 hours doesn't seem like a lot but it is a lot but then i got it yeah and it also has to be concentrated work so anyway Um, so I have those two open, but then so I can switch in between each client, but then I have one that's like for my course and ones that's just AI research because I have all these different tabs that I'm looking at and one for finances and, um, one that's like, I have few miscellaneous, I have one for school because I'm back in school and Etsy and like all kinds of different things and it's so much easier to switch back and forth. And I do catch myself opening something because I'm in a browser and I'm not in that tab and like, oh, switch it. But then I can just easily go move that tab to the workspace that it belongs. You have to pay for it. If you're only using five spaces, it's not worth it.
00:12:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Um, but right. But you could also do like, just go, this is but like, the way that I end up being effed is like, I'll have essentially three workspaces open across 20 times. And it's like, oh, all this ninja stuff should be over here. And then over here should be empire. And then over here should be fan flowy. And then what I end up with is just the row of tabs and they're not even next to each other.
00:13:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, which one is it? So, so you're selling me? Yes. Because also I have my computer is amazing and very fast. It can handle a ton of browsers. But it's browser windows, but there's still a limit to it. And I am one to push those boundaries. So this makes it easy. And I don't want to have to bookmark everything. And I lose stuff. And I don't lose things anymore. But also it serves because I've got that row of spaces on the left. Like, Oh, yeah, go check on that. Oh, I need to go check on that. So because I'm always in there choosing a space every day, I'm also getting a reminder of the things that I look at and work on most without having to be in a company. Completely separate app like a reminder app or my calendar or something else going.
00:14:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah, go look at that So anyway, I've been you know you can you oh you don't have back, but you can reduce like Okay, you can reduce that down right so that it's then in the bar and you're like, oh, that's my throat That's my basis work. I'm and then I could just launch that right. I literally have one called basis Okay, I'm gonna have to go. gonna have to this might be what I do this afternoon because I it was like I actually started feeling that it's the perfect time to start feeling that this week damn this is getting You know, it doesn't work and then I get to this place where I have to use the one tab because everything's just so janky and Then one tab reduces everything down to links, and then I'm like I never go back to it No, like they're there right. That's exactly the problem.
00:14:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm like I never go back to this That's why this is such and Although
00:15:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But it's like a cleanse, like, yeah, but that's always bad, though.
00:15:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because you need the tabs. Look, we're a tap your brain has multiple tabs open, your computer has multiple tabs open. It's just, it's the way your brain works, but I'm being able to switch from different devices. could log into my Chrome account on somebody else's computer, log into work on it and have all my stuff anywhere and just what you can.
00:15:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. That's a problem I run to run into when I'm making music is because that computer is not my computer. But I have to sign in sometimes is me and sometimes as I have a shared account for Apple for that. And so, so it also has a email address. So sometimes I have to use that, but 99% I use me.
00:15:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All you have to have is have whatever browser you're using install. We're gonna as a plug in on that machine. And then it's all into your Google account and you have all of your tabs open, right?
00:16:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Dealing.
00:16:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I just might be pop open as soon as you click on the thing.
00:16:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, that's interesting.
00:16:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yup.
00:16:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I need to. I do that too. I'll sometimes be on my laptop and then I switch to that computer and I have to look it up again.
00:16:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nope. It stays. It's transverse.
00:16:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, so what will happen though is I'll go on my laptop. So then all my bookmarks are inside Workana because that's the other thing because then I have to redo bookmarks and but I don't because I'm like I'm not doing that.
00:16:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, you don't and let's say you have a tab that you open frequently but you don't need to have it open all the time is let's say you've got 30 tasks tab work. Yes. Okay. So what you can do is save that as a resource and you can save it as a resource across multiple things. maybe. teamwork across spaces across street law anything else like that and you save it as a resource with one click to multiple workspaces and it's not an open tab but it's still easy for you just to go and click from the work on a home screen. Okay so here's the other thing so like let's say I have the tabs open my mission tab on my desktop and then I go open up my laptop and it says you were already working on this in another location do you want to resume work here and so I can say yes and it just takes over the most recent tabs and then just so the work transfers let's say I closed tabs on the laptop they're closed on the desktop when I come back to it.
00:17:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh wow okay. Interesting.
00:17:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just client I told him about. He's like yeah it wasn't. I'm like, and you're not using it right.
00:18:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
promise you because. Right. That's exactly the message I'm getting. But it's also like I just there was no there. That's a perfect example of they don't really tell you I'd use it. Yes. You're like, how am I supposed to use this? Like this is like a mini course, right?
00:18:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is like that's exactly that. And I think I'm like, I need to do some of these little hacks. Let me make sure my daughter's OK. Yes, OK, yeah. When I teach people stuff, because it is these little things.
00:18:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, Tina, Yeah, yes, but that's the other thing, too.
00:18:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like finding examples like this because a lot of people have really amazing stuff, whatever it is, do a terrible job of marketing, especially local, like local businesses. I just I look at them and I think I've never seen it out of yours like ever. And I just anyway, whoa.
00:19:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, yeah, totally.
00:19:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:19:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Market's best wins.
00:19:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It markets at all. That's the thing. Speaking of markets and market share.
00:19:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And another 71. How are we doing? I think I did the math roughly a few days ago. We're like, we're up like 16%. So we're gonna we're we're approaching 3.6 million. So we're we're on. I mean, I think we can get back to four because that's was like our apex. And then I'm still some of my Mercer stuff didn't work. And then some of it's not going to work. I got another answer from them today. So for yesterday, so now I got to go check. I set up some new stuff. going to make sure it's working. I think one thing is messed up. I'm going to have to ask them why it's partially working. But I got to peek at it really quick. first but if Mushi's new thing is tracking and the stuff that I overlooked that I added is working and then I got the video thing's the one that's broken I got to get help fixing that then I'm like done as far as like all right I know how to set a custom event Mushi I know how to set these other events these on page events the standard sort of built in which would be the video one then I know how to do sort of the his his ace events set those up don't know how to do them in GDN yet because they weren't working so I haven't taken that up with Melissa yet but if they're working I can get with her and then I need to go I still need to go through one more module now then I can go into the advanced JavaScript and just see if there's which is essentially what I did with Mushi anyway but that was very specific to me I want to see what they say like is there anything from that that makes me go oh that's interesting oh I could do that uh so ideally I would get that done I don't do it today or tomorrow right next week but then we're also going to visit Santa Cruz next Thursday so yeah so I can't be on a conics Thursday although I totally didn't think about that when I put the flight but I'll be on a flight or I'll be touring the campus I'll be doing one of the other I know you don't like calls on other days but can we reschedule yeah we can do it on Friday if you can do it on Friday or okay yeah Friday are gonna still be there because I can move it to Wednesday if you'd rather move in and out Tina boom boom okay we're just doing a tour and getting the lay of the land and then and then in two weeks we go back again for the movement Thursday no on a Saturday

00:22:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I was booking the flights and it was like, okay. And oh wait, that's September 11th.
00:22:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am not flying on that day. Oh my gosh.
00:22:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There. That was like literally about to hit purchase.
00:22:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I go way to say. Ha ha ha. You're like, no.
00:22:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Encore. No, thank you. Yeah. No, I'm looking for that. Any day would be a day to send a message. Right. Probably that. So I don't want to be a part of a message. Thursday it is.
00:22:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's crazy too how many people had stories of they were supposed to be traveling that day, but something happened or somebody said go or They knew they shouldn't go and like, why am I?
00:23:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:23:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, so you were about to tell me when you think it was going to get done.
00:23:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then you. So I'm going to try to get it done next week. So I mean, I could probably watch a bunch of it on those flights, too. So that's ample. Airports are great for that stuff and flight.
00:23:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My throat is killing me because I almost literally choked to death. I thought I was on a call talking to my friend. And I'm like, I'm really, truly going to die. being here.
00:23:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Just just be aware about to die.
00:23:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I had these capsules and they got wet and they stuck to each other. I'm such a miser. I could swallow that. almost did not able to. And it was mind over matter because I had to keep shoving water down. But the water wasn't going down. And I'm like, it's just coming back up. And I'm I'm just in suffocating. as a role, by the way, especially for an asthmatic when you've suffocated almost to that many times. Well, lovely. Well, I'm okay with it. It hurts now.
00:24:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Anyway, well, then it feels like they're still there. That's the worst part.
00:24:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Fortunately, that is not what's happening. Yeah, but it's just like everything just feels like if I swallow again, it feels like I have a sore throat, but I'm for all that it is, I'm like, thank you, God, thank you, God, thank you, God.
00:24:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, not dead, not dead.
00:24:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, literally. When I could finally talk again, she was just talking, she had no idea. I'm just going here. I can't believe this is happening. Like, and I'm trying to dream what I was soaking wet. Anyway, it was an interesting morning.
00:24:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Thought it's your dad.
00:24:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No draw, though. No, no, no, Exactly. We can just watch ourselves die. I feel like, I don't know, it's just surreal. Anyway, okay, so we're going through that and try to finish it by next week. And then what's the next?
00:25:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, ultimately, I would like to have tracking goings that we can go into 2025, right? January, we'd be like, all right, it's a normal year, supposedly. And then we very much know what to expect, right?
00:25:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Q, how is it?
00:25:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
When not like 25, that's like a penny, but it's like, we're all intent, right? It's like, okay, no COVID, no, no exam changes. That is a change, but it's a positive change. I guess it's not totally normal, it's normal, or, I mean, I'm going to find out how many more that actually is, because I don't know, but the, and then just have, it's like this stuff is going to, should settle down in November, and then where people exit isn't December like all that stuff will happen as as it does But then it's like, okay, where are we really at if we keep this 31? Think I mean, I think 31 is 4 million if I'm not mistaken So it's like we've never got past that I Guess we could but it's not on purpose But if the numbers 31 it's like okay, 31 is the number to be and And then we'll do I wanted to advise a plan based on data shocker to figure out how to beat that number What was See this is why I need to make my dashboard, so Orange new subscriptions, okay, And you think that's for money, okay I Think that's for you know, that's our ideal number based on historical data. It's like that's the best we've ever been and kind of thing. So, we'll see.
00:27:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, just out of Thirty-one puts you over four million.
00:27:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Thirty-one, yeah.
00:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Roughly. And we'll find out where if the ceiling is real or if it changes because of all this stuff. So, I just, I'd curiosity, don't know how this works because I don't know what the different sections are. But I wrote how many score releases for CPA Exam 2025. This is the course Becker said, the course sections will be available with continuous testing and 16 different score releases release dates in 2025.
00:27:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The core is odd for in reg.
00:27:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's four sections in that, right?
00:27:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes, it'd be other sections. I forget what they're called, but those, Those are probably so all the additional score release. So I guess this is what they're doing. There are now section dedicated score releases. So the score releases that the score release. The core score releases usually where we get our huge bump and that will not be we won't be as effective as much because the number one section is far. So it's still in core. Therefore, their back is gone. Back is going to be those other things. And back is this I think the lowest section. So if anything, if we will either get the same outcomes around the score release or nearly the same, and then you're just going to get all these bonus outcomes around the supplemental or whatever. And there's three tests in that. But you only have to pass one so it's like ISC TCP and something else they pick one they have to pass it We don't really know the failure rates and stuff yet because I'm not people have taken it to fail But that number will be more solidified by Certainly by the end of the year If I add these up, I think it was around 23 and I don't know if this is right But I would imagine What do they call them the other ones?
00:29:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Disciplines the other ones are disciplines 16 And there's no other But unless 21 22 23 24 25 Are these
00:30:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, that's this year, right?
00:30:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's right, right.
00:30:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's why. Those are the remaining ones.
00:30:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:30:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. that's all of them. So, I'm pretty sure that's way more core releases and core releases are where we crush.
00:30:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right.
00:30:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And so, we should benefit just period, finally, something might go in our favor.
00:30:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, 16 core releases, how many are there normally?
00:30:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's, there's been no normal, right? Oh, yeah. stopped doing them. Last year, they changed it, right? So, we'd have to go look at like 2019. I'm sure someone still has that post it somewhere, but I don't know about that. I'm That's something. Yeah, that sounds right. It's like, I was going to say, it's like two or three a quarter.
00:31:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So five more score releases than 2009.
00:31:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Five more core and then totally new ones. Well, not totally new, but they're new as of this year.
00:31:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
2018 was 11. I it. I'm thinking 2025. And do you really good for another spending?
00:32:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, yeah Does Jeff know how good he has it with his van? Yeah He should just making sure yeah, he just doesn't like He just doesn't like when I say no Don't like it. I already know where your hands is going to be. No, but let me just get it out.
00:32:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I go. No Hi Yeah Good like he's waffling on he's waffling on doing the new products.
00:32:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm like we are doing it And he tried he tried to argue You know argue his point on monday and he's saying, you know when we did We did the subscription thing. I go dude. Well, we did the subscription thing I knew exactly what was going to happen If we did exactly what was on the sheet and we did you even call the timeline pretty close Yeah, yeah, it was all map. So here I said, I don't know what's going to happen. So he wanted to lower the make of the low end price $47. I'm like, no way, man. That's a bad idea because you're baking in a potential failure. I'm like, it cannot be lower than 67 because worst case scenario is everyone buys the 67 still and we have achieved nothing other than there's now a clear separation between a supplement and a course. And yes, some people will buy the course, but we have no idea. My argument is we raised the base price $10 and then we sell the other one for $87 and I'm sticking to that idea. And we're baking in growth. I mean, Jeff has had a winning idea or two, Oh, yeah, totally.
00:33:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He comes up with stuff that I don't. But when it comes to the math of these types of things, I mean, the odds are in your paper for sure.
00:34:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and it's, I mean, it's come out. She also wasn't understanding, I got, dude, we change the price of a subscription, we are starting at zero. You're literally erasing everything because we have no data on a $47 product. So then you have to wait 18 months based on our AOV or LTV to know what's really happening. go, that is not worth it.
00:34:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So, I saw a post of Noreos today with his watercolor.
00:34:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
you see that? No, I haven't mapped it on the Facebooks at all. What?
00:34:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
a good distressor, but he's very proud of it. And it reminded me of Eor. So I thought about Mark's view. Terrible. They have that correlation. Yeah. So. It's not, I don't think that this is gossip, can not say anything, but, which is very interesting to me to get to talk to Chona, and I don't know anything about her other than you tell that people said he shouldn't marry her, but she is very enthusiastic. I'm like, is this going to be like when a, you know, husband recommends his wife to something and there's a strange woman, but she is so excited to work with me and so enthusiastic and so open and just really like kind of incredible, like the kind of person like, I just like, I love you, like, you're just so awesome. And anyway, and the first thing, well, the only thing that came up was, she's like, see, have to check my brain and be like, is this okay to share or whatever. This is between you and me and also, I think that is some type one good because of the. don't see intimate level we work with Mark and I mean that as just talking about the hard things that he goes through. We're not the average business people.
00:36:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No.
00:36:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But the biggest thing is that she's like his brain is like zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom all over the place and I could do this and I could do that and she's like I don't understand how that works. I'm like calm down. I don't like you know so he's got these big dreams and big visions and she is just starting to because she's a Filipina woman.
00:36:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:36:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Women in general are are bred to do a particular type of thing but especially in certain cultures and definitely in the Philippines and it's not to dream big and do big and act big but she's in this world where she's around very successful people all the time and thinks you know I could have that because Mark encourages or Mark thinks that she can do so anyway I can see how that would there would be a lot of resistance of not knowing how to to be in a world where you come from a culture of, I don't know, not the flash that Mark is around all the time, you know.
00:37:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah, totally.
00:37:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, she's just like, I just, and I told her what I would do would bridge would be to bridge the gap between his excitement and his big vision and pace it for her and explain it to her. But I don't think that he can because that's the thing that I do, I think, really well as liaison between different types and personality types. And she's like, oh my gosh, that would be amazing. Anyway, she's, she's excited and I'm excited about it. And so anyway, I'll show that because I just think that that's cool. I also humbled and honored, I guess, if anybody puts you with their family member of any type, I just think what a compliment. So, thanks. also you gave me again. And also D&D company, I want to give a thanks to you guys, but
00:38:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
because there's going through things I know but you didn't but you didn't give me any ideas you said you gave me ideas oh i think i think so fixated on this like getting the whole moving like can't talk about it because i'm like it's happening like it got dropped in my lap and then but it's like people around her acting very weird right just like okay i'm gonna make this happen moving a needle in right yeah not you guys okay no no yeah that whole thing is like now it's real becoming more real right and it's but also it's like none of us know what it's right it's like it's just conceptual it's like yeah so what happened yeah yeah but even in the beginning it's still surreal until holidays or something happens and
00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She needs you and she can't immediately get to you. Although you've got way more resources so you can do that quickly. But, yeah, it's, uh, exactly. Thank you.
00:39:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's why I dand signed up for Southwest credit card that gets points.
00:39:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And gave Denise one and said, you can do this whenever you want them.
00:39:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Both, both you.
00:39:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They don't like you, but they're going to know you're amazing.
00:39:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Good job, dad. Good job.
00:39:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, anyway, if just a type of gift basket, something, if you have some ideas, I don't want to nag you about things or bug you, but you forget. So I'll just do texting and teaming until I get an answer. Okay. So Stacy said, um, I got more questions. But in terms of like, you said Bobby finished, she wasn't aware that he'd finish in about as I was wrong. Yeah.
00:39:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay.
00:39:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Yep. Um, but it's getting worked on still.
00:40:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so I didn't realize that he so him and I have had a conversation about, uh, we're using like reset you as the example. So I think we had this conversation on Thursday. So like they made another request for, I'll just say a funnel. And the problem is that this is so sad. Apparently nobody can scope this except for me. Because Abish, I could be Jay's version. was like, Oh, think that's right. Bobby's version. was like, eh, that's not right either. And then Dan's version was, can't we just do X, Y, Z? And then those guys are like, yeah, we could. I go, OK, well, then let's that's how this is done. But then it and also my part. the problems then. And then I pointed this out. In the future, this would be a template. This would be a cloud template. So let's keep that in mind. Right. So in the future, if someone didn't, basically what I was like, Hey, no, no, no, we can just copy this funnel kit funnel and swap out the product. Done. Now if they want this to then go into lead flow or whatever, like this funnel does, then we need to, you know, estimate those hours or how much I can be doing this with those hours, which they can easily do. And I was like, but if it was just in the future, it was like, Hey, they want sales page. Well, we're going to have like sales page, ABC. And then we might have funnel AV that we might have phone or we might have whatever, right? And but it would be a cloud template. And we would say, so it would be launch cloud template, create product if it doesn't exist, attach product done. So we figured that out and then that reduced the scope, essentially, then, mean, I have to check in VJ's rate for that is like 25 bucks.
00:42:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:42:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So Bobby's like, what, what, what do we raise it? I go, my answer was all I'm saying is it needs to be a minimal 40% and Bobby's like, I think we should triple their price. I go, is that a minimal 40% because I go, is that a minimal 40% because it's way more than that. go, great. How much does it come out to be? It's like, it's 150 bucks. I go, I go, I like that better because then that sort of bakes in them being able to raise their price and us not having to, right? So, but I go, I always want to have a 40% profit margin on whatever we're doing. That's my target, right? We're not going for an agency 15. We're going for 40. just that's it, right? And then, so now. from that perspective, I was like, we can go revisit the pricing of the service from that vantage point. How do we say, how do we figure out what is the 40%, so it's not 40% now, it's that we're getting maybe it's 60 now, and we know that, hey, we're going to have to, this is going to happen, right? We're going to have to upgrade the server with Presidion. Well, that's a humongous price height. It's quadruple, but we won't be using all the resources, right? We're just going to absorb that cost. So you go from 800 to 3000, and I got, we've been avoiding it for months and months and months. like, no, we're not switching, because I'm not, I'm not eating that cost right now. So it would be like, okay, we have to factor in that. And then we have to factor in the Abish again, DJ, like I would factor in the doubling, right? And then, so where, how do we figure out that pricing that GPT will be? So that's, that's the last conversation I haven't thought about it on, I think it's 3-0 Friday. Except what I just said, I never said.
00:44:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's it right there. don't know if I can have it, but I'll.
00:44:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's okay. totally know what I just said.
00:44:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I did make most of the notes in here. So if you wanted to look at that. Yeah.
00:44:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, because my other argument was like, we have to be comparative to a good job or whatever, but we don't have to. Pop their price.
00:44:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can be higher than that. Well, yeah, because.
00:44:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's more than that. That's, this is a managed service. Yeah.
00:44:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is not managed. Right. Yeah. Yes, I'm just going to put this in here in your text or email or I'm just to send the link. I think that, I mean, it would be interesting to me to have a conversation with chat GPT about your scenarios where you can't get people on the same page with you about some of the text stuff and say, look, here's our scenario, here's the task, here's what these people said, this is their role, here's what this person said, so I'm checking BJ, this is what I said, this is what I suggested. I don't know if we could give it enough information to be able to help but. But anyway, the biggest thing is if you could come up with a, almost like a decision matrix for them to measure the logic and go, like, how did you come to that conclusion? What's the simplest way to do it, which maybe would be the decision point, right? little diamond, is it these options, whatever, which one is the simplest, whatever that type of thing?
00:46:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think the problem is that there is, like, we haven't defined, hey, these are the three landing pages, hey, these are the sales pages, right? They're defined only in design only, but they're not defined like, I mean, to be completely honest, they don't even exist in reality, right? They exist in that the blocks exist, so therefore you could make that layout, but we have never made the layout or used it, because the theme is irrelevant. So in the future, whatever sales page and checkout page reset you is using, I will get rid of it. It would be like, hey, put them on checkout page A or one or whatever the naming command becomes. And then there's no question, it's like, hey, they need a new funnel funnel one. Okay, great. knows what funnel is. funnel one is, what funnel one does, where funnel one lives. But right now there is no funnel one, right? Everything is, it's, there is no menu. The menu exists only in concept, but the menu does not exist in reality because the item on the menu also doesn't exist, but that should all be resolved come November, come October, asked Abishik for an update today, like, all right, Eric says we're on track with Frank. Are we on track with Frank? If we are on track, do you have an ETA for? the woofer site launch and he's asleep so I'll probably get that answer tomorrow. But I mean that's it, but that's literally D-Day. Or B-Day, basis day.
00:48:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Go B-Day.
00:48:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
D-Day's got the publications.
00:48:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to send that to you soon because I wasn't paying attention because I was talking to you. I'm just going to add this part into which is that you haven't defined the pages or the layouts and that that will help with the logic and the pricing.
00:48:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, the menu will be real, right? It'll be like it will be like you can have a picture, right? Here's what your burrito is going to look like.
00:48:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like a catalog with an actual image that you can have and here's the you know the item in the catalog.
00:48:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So yeah. Yeah, and then we'll be able to and that it will be in use, right? Fulfer will be using what would be check out page one and then sales page layout like the sales page layout is, you know, the copy that Maria and I did and the design is done and if the copies all in it, like, but it's been built how you I'm going to I'm started meeting with her this week, every day. I'm again.
00:49:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so.
00:49:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Every day. Yeah.
00:49:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So all 15 minutes a day. So I can just get a I'm talking to somebody who cares about what I'm doing. And so I get a little like accountability and. On the bill of body. Yes. Um, I think, I think, um, the, there's equal benefit to both of us, but the power I know of what I'm giving her is different. She already feels different. She's excited. She's on fire. she's, she's like, I should be so tired today. ate gluten and I went to sleep late. whatever she's like, but I'm energized. I'm like, that's what clarity does, baby. But yeah, so I think that I think that will be really good for me. But like one of the things we did today was I asked her basically her business origin story and she's amazing. Like she's done crazy things and she's probably a genius. And just really, um, I don't think she's always played small, but, but she, uh, again, I don't think I'm, I don't, by the way, telling people to have to think.
00:50:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, her and I went deep.
00:50:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't worry. So anyway, basically being married to a narcissist, rector, as it does to women, uh, get anybody. Yeah. But yeah. So anyway, I think that, um, she's just. and new seasons of life and everything else. But anyway, she's really, really smart. She just is not centered on anything. I'm trying to figure that out, but I think her heart is her center because she just loves business. both had paper routes and bought our first bikes with our paper route.
00:51:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Anyway, I didn't feel like you two have parallel vibes and almost parallel resumes. Because she was undercover behind the scenes on some largish stuff. But then ultimately, it didn't work out, right? Whether for whatever reasons, right? the business was F-ed up or the guy was F-ed up or whatever. And then she went sort of solo still undercover and she, like you, is very much resistant to it's bizarre. It's, I want to, but I don't want to do her own thing, right? So she's, so she's, she's putting her toe in and she's pulling her toe back out. And then she's like doing it. And, but it seems like it's inevitable.
00:52:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, he doubts herself very much. Yeah, which is weird because it's not how you deal with the narcissist for so long.
00:52:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, exactly.
00:52:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
she's got the result. You do crap.
00:52:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Cause somebody literally tells you that every day. Yeah. She's got the results. So it's like, that's the part that matters. Yeah. She's got the, the, the speak, she knows the language.
00:52:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She, she's very, she's data driven.
00:52:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Like, yeah, I mean, I'm dying to do something with her. just need a damn code.
00:52:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. We should do something with the three of us. You would balance us out. So good.
00:52:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh my gosh. Yeah. want to do mom and family with her period. Like, I'm going to, yeah, that's what I want to do with. I told her about it. She's like, oh my god that sounds like that sounds so cool and i'm like i already know how to generate the leads already you're i'm going to put them into that thing that i sent you that's my plan i'm like okay i can put them into this i will i'll use high level for the whole thing i was generating leads for less than two bucks on this one lead magnet i think i might change the lead magnet marks working on it i talked to them about it this week i just need to sort of revisit that stuff and go i need the code and then it would be like all right cool get all the design stuff pulled together you know most of it is and just make sure it's all looks right built right and then i don't want to run ads oh so you did that for sure i know i don't want to run ads but i want to be involved in the ads right it's like okay and then obviously be able to have someone this that gets data right and then i can and i feel like i can get her data no one else ever does yeah here we go like And then, but she's, she's, you know, all her little case studies are very dated through them. Yeah. That's how you do it. Yeah.
00:54:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
she gets it.
00:54:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Funnels successes math, blah, blah.
00:54:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're going like, yep. Yep. I'm like, that's, and I could keep her focused. So she doesn't sabotage and over stretch and do too many things. So there's any, any way to help there or just, I would just love to see her work with somebody.
00:54:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's good. I mean, it's literally my plan. I'm just waiting for the damn code and it's probably not going to happen until I realize it's probably not going to happen until January, but whatever. That's fine. New year, 2025.
00:54:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's go. She's awesome. I'm so excited to see what happens though when she, I don't know, I like liberating people and she is a person that was guarded and trapped. told her it's, it's, I saw the mask and I was like, I'm just going to tell you, I think you're guarded and you can't be like that with me. So I'm pushing and we'll see what happens, but she let me in.
00:55:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So anyway, yeah.
00:55:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
more smart women.
00:55:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm so excited.
00:55:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I wouldn't know about her without you either. So thank you, I had no idea.
00:55:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
She was her. She, she.
00:55:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Keep my interest. But you find her because you go down rabbit holes.
00:55:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. Hopefully.
00:55:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you for being a rabbit hole follower.
00:55:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. It was, she said something about writing coffee for women, I think. Or it was very into what I was doing with the chat GPT thing. The wolf or spreadsheet.
00:55:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:55:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Which we ended up using.
00:55:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
hard. Superized guys, any movement in that conversation.
00:55:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I never even wrote them back. just. don't see a path. And so I realized with you, right, where I was like, oh, we really need this. Right, right, right. I reached out to Hamza, wrote him a brief scope, saw that he read it on Upwork, hit him up again with my favorite, my favorite response. Yes, question mark, no question mark, maybe question mark. And he responded, and he was like, I would like to do this hourly because it's, you know, a bit of a moving target, whatever. And I said, that sounds great. Can you give me an estimate on the hours that would take you to create a beta that we only use internally? Does it mean a thing? I just need something that we can bang on. And he said, I will do that. And I will get back to you. think he said he would do it today. I am not really logged in off work yet today. So I'll check on that. He's 40 bucks an hour. He's as good as hired. Let's see. He comes back and says $400, which I seriously tell you So yeah, I think he's going to say, you know, 15, 20 hours, not even how do you know, we'll see.
00:57:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they'll be way cheaper than they and some of you that supervise things that they're going to get. Yeah, but then you'll be a competitor, guess what?
00:57:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And I'll be able to go back with them and say, hey, look, I just did this for $600, right? And the cost, I know the cost, I know I can figure out the cost for me to use their software and convert someone to an email. That's the only cost I care about, right? So for them to create a follower is 30 cents. I can do that with an ad. I can do it at a greater scale. So then the question is Can I turn the ads? What's the cost of turning an ad into a follower versus the super ice?
00:58:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's going to be super duper close and The way I do that is with potentially $1,000 What I'm just taking $1,000 out $1,000 ad Yeah, was like we don't spend it Which could still be all power flowing You know what I just realized It took me that when you were talking about lead flow you're like I've never been able to visualize all that it is like for me It was a system that and it took me forever to get here figuring out that it was your automations in high level But to me, but now I it's your high level account period Right that you call lead flowing Yeah, that's my white they don't dance. Yeah, I do not realize that. This is the thing without seeing the stuff when we talk about it conceptually and not screen share, I'm like, it takes me so much longer to wrap my head around it. Yeah, which is probably a useful conversation in when you struggle with having any conversations with Abhishek and Vijay, maybe doing more screen sharing as they're talking about things, just clicking on it, looking at it so that they can make the visual correlation between what's happening in your mind.
00:59:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, I don't know what I think the issue there is, you know, they were, they like, the information gets to them incorrectly. So basically, they based it off of literally what Ross wrote the ticket. But then they did another task that Frick rope, and I'm like, why is this a landing page? Like, is there a reason why you guys made this landing page that I'm not getting? Because it shouldn't be a landing page. And then, and then, so Eric screwed that up. And then I started to, I was like, oh, we should do XYZ. And then I sent that. And then the next day was like, wait a minute. I looked at the page, then even I got it. I looked at the page and I like, whoa. You know what, I didn't even talk to the SNO people. So, you know, when the information you're working off of is wrong, essentially, or, you know, sort of mis-scoped. But that version gets resolved by the menus. The one that I just brought up is just a one-off that, you know, we just, it just wasn't obvious looking at the design, what it was to any of us. Yeah. Then I went to Gert. And then even when Gert. Sabry wanted, I was like, how did he do that? This is custom. Okay, I know what it needs to be now. So they actually built it right. It's just now we have to decide it should not be on the page for a different reason, even though it works.
01:01:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Any updates on Mom? Just I got to get the book over to Katie.
01:01:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So Katie was waiting to close on her house, which they did over the weekend and they're moved in. Just sent a photo with her large cheeked baby. The baby's got like jowls. like, oh my god. So much cheeks. So now that there she's like, you know what, we just got to get that out of the way. So I got to dig that up, send it over to her with my thoughts. What I was thinking as far as this metaphor of the organization and then her and Jeff was like, We'll do it, or, you know, that her husband's name or something? Yeah, he's also an editor. So between the two of them and me, we should be able to get it. then Mark's like, I don't give a what you do with that. It's a great, because that's pretty much my plan. Not giving a about what you think. Sorry, buddy. Good job writing it. And then that to me is like the Maria project. It's like a book funnel. Or that's one of them. So like I imagine you could have a book funnel and then you could have the freebie funnel, which would be the cheat sheet, right? Which is going to be a release cheat sheet kind of thing. That's the new one that Mark's working on now. Before we used a royalty cheat sheet that worked, but I'm not sure it attracted the right avatar. But then again, we also didn't have a funnel to drive them through, right? Like I was just proving. step one, can I get a lead? could now buy that stupid snapshot probably today and then get moving on that. Oh, I guess I need to make a mom account or I don't think I have one. Now I have to move the mom account like I told you now I'm just move it. gonna move it between agencies and then I'll make the team account. I do have a bunch of leads in there.
01:03:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I now that the girls are back in school, I'm just like doing the best of doing things out and they're not around all the time. It's something about just hovering as a mom when the kids are home. I'm afraid to get into anything because I'm not even kidding you. The percentage is probably high 90s. Every time I sit down and I'm ready to be creative, the people I care about most want to talk. nobody wants to talk to me for hours then hours hours and so I'm just can't about it because they're not gonna be here forever so I just be like okay let it go and I feel like a slacker and I judge myself and I'm like I'm not but still like that's just my priority but anyway all right it's 110 10 and they're texting me and I probably should let you go yeah I'll give you one update this is gonna be great it's gonna be like the cliffhanger update and then we're gonna I'm gonna just hang up on you and there is informing Jamie today that she's out I need to save those notes so apparently there's a 60 day first write a refusal clause that she's gonna tell Jamie this exists FYI so you have 60 days and she's asking for 300 grand
01:05:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Which is not going to happen.
01:05:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, so then what does that mean?
01:05:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Then she can go sell it without Jimmy's input at all.
01:05:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's rough. Yeah. I am happy for Heather. I can't not feel bad for Jamie. No, what she did in it, but I don't. Wish, you know, there's so many things that go into how she behaves. And not everything is her fault. But even when we do do things and it is our fault, you still kind of got to feel bad. Because somewhere something, something went wrong and it's just. I'm glad for Heather moving on and maybe it'll help Jamie. I we all have to learn lessons and usually the hard way.
01:05:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
have to learn everything the hard way pretty much. Yeah. mean. I talked to Heather and I said, just be prepared for like, no one's going to buy this. I hate to break it to you. And then so I'm like, you should have a, you know, owner financed thing on the table. She's like, I don't trust Jamie to do that. I go, no, I know you control all the finances. So the owner finance would be, I'm taking 80% of the revenue until this number is met. And then I'm releasing it all to you. Period. And she's like, oh, that could be a plan B.
01:06:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, girl, that's your plan A. hate to break it down.
01:06:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It looks like it's a plan B, but it's really, yeah, yeah. You might want to add a bubble to the bottom of that A because it's a B.
01:06:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's man, business is like, parenthood too. Like you think it's going to be one thing and you build it to be one thing and it's never, but you think it's going to be no matter how hard you work it to be that way.
01:06:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no, And I was like do it. Yes. was like just do it right now And then we had a call together this morning and Jamie was so awful on the call.
01:07:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like oh my god What's she?
01:07:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What's that I was gonna ask what she did, but I'm not trying to be like oh it was just like she all out of nowhere Was saying well, I didn't get paid to do the gen pucks of videos last time and you know It's got a big deal, but this time I want to get paid and Heather's like you've never been paid to do those. Yes I have I think we're just both misremembering Heather's like no, Jamie Never happened. Yes. Well in December of 2022. So clearly she like Rose is narrowed over to her head I got a large check in December 2022 right before the gen tucks deal launched Heather said yeah That was a member distribution because we were flush with cash Nothing to do with generation that's not how I remember it and Heather's like yeah, but that's what it is. There's no record of you ever. So then Jamie there because Jen Tucks came back. And so first Jamie didn't want to do it because they have so many bad reviews. And it was like, you know, there's a moral aspect to this. And I was so ninja on the phone. And I was I can't wait. I was when I talked to Heather, like, you see what I did there? And by the end of the call, Jamie was like, Oh, yeah, let's do the videos. I'm like, you're so weird. And that but then I don't know where she brought up this thing where she should get paid as the talent to do the videos. And then Heather goes, I guess we'll just do the the version that doesn't happen. And then it was like, oops. And then I'm like, Oh, this is so over. That was after the show up on video. No, I don't know. I was on the phone.
01:08:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They might have been I could just imagine the faces on one of the calls with the two of them when they were going through stuff. And that was when Heather first started standing up to Jamie after we'd had some talks and I was like this is really glad I wasn't on video because I have no hope for me at all. Okay. Anyway. That's a terrible way to end a meeting on whatever. Go pet my dog.
01:09:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There you go. Me too. Let me go eat some food too.
01:09:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Perky.
01:09:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's good.
01:09:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. I am.
01:09:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
As matter of fact, exactly that.
01:09:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Seven years.
01:09:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I've learned a couple of things. Here we go. All right.

Hi.
00:00:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, how are you, Fuji?
00:00:03 - Michael F
Good. Well, I'm so sorry I missed Monday.
00:00:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's okay. It happened like that stuff happened, Mom. It's a second. Sorry. this is why I didn't want you in here in the first place, you know? Yeah, it could be anything though.
00:00:32 - Michael F
like to bark at the deer all the time.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They tag with the deer, which is hilarious. They'll chase each other up and down the fence. All right, so let's start with reports, just first your kind of verbal report of how things have gone for you this week.
00:01:00 - Michael F
I started working again so like yesterday and today I did full days of work well totally full but so I usually help with the baby until like one or something like that and then Esther takes over the rest of the evening and then I go actually we have an extra room so I go sleep in our office and then I get up whatever 745 whatever it is and then 730 and then go to work so yeah I'm thankful for the uninterrupted sleep so it's nice that Esther but yeah it's tough on Esther like she was super tired yesterday and super tired today just because I'm not helping her so it takes her like an extra you know 15 minutes to feed instead of gain sleep yeah just baby things baby things that's gonna be it so you have some assignments
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
to them?
00:02:01 - Michael F
Yeah, they lose it and then make a better, think, better chart for the sleeve, I think.
00:02:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we also talked about finishing the business spreadsheet that the time tracker, we talked about tracking time, but we're not going to start that yet, right? Because I think we said we start, I think I asked you to decide when you wanted to start because we're not really, things will normal out more once you get in September when you get your housekeeper, I guess, but she's kind of the assistant also.
00:02:46 - Michael F
Yeah, I think that's a little more reasonable.
00:02:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, going to wait until then. And how does you do on, I see the stuff that you have in the timesheet homework, but not nothing in step two, just the step one. And talk about that in a minute. talk about that in a We talked about you getting some information from the, or maybe this was the week before now, because sometimes things run together, but from the neighbors about the cleaner. Oh, yeah.
00:03:44 - Michael F
Yeah, we interviewed her. Doesn't really like the cooking, because we were thinking we could use her as a cook to meal prep for us, but the neighbor was like, she doesn't. She can cook in a pinch, but wouldn't have her as that final. She's very meticulous, like she's kind of like loves keeping things clean, so that's nice. So hopefully her and Esther will see eye to eye. And then, yeah, overall, I think the neighbor just says she's just very good with the kids. The kids love her. And, you know, she's not a teaching nanny where the kids are going to come out being like, you know, readers or stuff, she's more of just a companion. She's always talking to them in Spanish. She's just talking, talking to them. And she says both of the kids are like super, and they're both introverted. And she's like, yeah, both of my kids are just like, love talking. They talk in Spanish. And she thinks a big part of that was the, Dolores, the housekeeper, because she's just talking to them, not on her phone or anything like that. So, yeah, we feel pretty good about Something happens in employment.
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it just helps you simplify the steps to hire her formally as an employee and so we talked a little bit about the structure of how you would hire her like whether or not you would make that a separate LLC with Esther or like an escort for paying wages. Did you give that any more thought for structure?
00:05:26 - Michael F
No.
00:05:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that anything that you still want to think about?
00:05:30 - Michael F
You've got some time so. Yeah, you know I'll actually that would just the easiest things I just asked my accountant. I'm like hey can we should we can we hire this person okay and then I think that'll take some yeah I'll just shoot a quick email to my accountant that'll take care of that issue. He says yes then we'll hire her under one of the companies. He says it doesn't really matter then I'll just do this pop-ins payroll thing and and set up. I don't think I'm for that. You asked them by any chance that they use nanny cams. No, I didn't. Sorry, I was going to do that now, but didn't.
00:06:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you want a reminder to think about that or not big deal?
00:06:22 - Michael F
I think let me talk that over with Esther. think that's a good thing. Yeah, maybe a reminder to talk that with Esther. She's been, yeah, because she hasn't had my help at night. She's been a little more sleepy and jumpy. So I haven't really talked to her the last few days about anything serious, more just kind of what do you need? What food do you need by your bed? can I help you with? But I think hopefully tonight I'll be able to help out obviously tomorrow. So I think she'll feel better after she gets. I have no idea how she slept last night. She hasn't texted me all day, so she might be just dead today again.
00:07:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Maybe they all got some naps together.
00:07:10 - Michael F
Yeah, we bought a new bassinet because she was just dying. She wouldn't sleep in our other bassinet, so we're trying to win that like rocks.
00:07:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh baby swings are lifesavers.
00:07:22 - Michael F
Yeah, yeah.
00:07:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would literally just pick the baby swing up. My muscles were good. I'd just drag it around the house if I was doing kitchen work working, whatever, because yeah, it'd be when they get bigger bouncers, but yeah.
00:07:37 - Michael F
There we have one.
00:07:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but swings when they're little, especially the ones that have the mobile and the music at the same time, and they go side to side instead of front and back so that the baby doesn't experience like that falling sensation, and it's just more.
00:07:55 - Michael F
Yeah. Yeah, we have that one that goes like this.
00:07:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh huh. Yes. Okay, so what day, like is she starting the first week of September?
00:08:11 - Michael F
The contract I think we're going to do is just straight up September, I actually don't even know what day that is, Sunday, okay, so it's probably September 2nd, yeah, so we'll start her on September 2nd.
00:08:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Esther's got a few weeks, do you guys have some like days to figure it out basically where you have slow days where you can just kind of let her catch up on sleep or something?
00:08:36 - Michael F
We're gonna, oh, oh, yeah, you mean like the trial run, oh yeah, no I didn't ask Esther about that, that would be kind of neat, yeah, just like going like a sadder.
00:08:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, because Dolores works Monday through Friday with the other family, but I was asking about you like on your slow days just being able to give her a relief on a day a week or something where she could just.
00:09:00 - Michael F
catch up. Oh yeah, that's interesting. I have an like on like Monday, I could help her Sunday evening Monday. Yeah. I think about while you're back to work, there's components of it.
00:09:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One is just the actual being able to do it, but two, there is the remember how it felt as soon as you knew you had somebody coming in. There was an instant relief. So if Esther knows that there's a day that she gets to look forward to know if I could just get through this day, Michael's going to be here and I can rest and or food. She just calls me food time. so she just kind of has like, I don't have to get through to September. I just have to get through to this day. And then I can sleep all day long if that's what it takes. just kind of rest and know because I mean, it sometimes, especially when When they're that young, it can feel just so daunting that your body is never going to get a chance to recover because you don't know when you're going to get to sleep at all.
00:10:11 - Michael F
Sleep deprivation is really hard on mental health too. Yeah, I think she's catching up to her now, but yeah, that's a good idea I could offer that. She gets up every two and a half, three hours to pump, which is just killer for her sleeping. And so, yeah, on the nights that I'm around, she just focuses on pumping and then I do the bottle feed, diaper, and then rock the baby back to sleep. So yeah, I mean, I think maybe, yeah, I can ask her if there's anything more that I can do to give her a more prolonged time off, but I know the pumping is really difficult right now because she's, well, she's breastfeeding in the day, and then she says at night, breasts hurt, so she has to pump every three hours. ours to clear it. Yeah, let me ask, let me ask if there's anything I could do to just give her something to look forward to or or something.
00:11:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just until you get Dolores and in it, you know, it's not necessarily sleep doesn't have to be about nighttime, but just whenever you can get couple extra chunks like yeah, it was interesting. I was reading a study this week about how napping every well, so being a napper, being quantified as being somebody who naps at least three or more times a week, reduces death by heart disease or any kind of help heart failure by like 67% in women and like 84% in men. And that there is no medication, not necessarily being well, a pill, but any other prescription of any type that has such an impact. no pill that you can give anyone with any kind of heart issues that would have as much of an impact. so you can make all the correlation and inferences to what that does. And also, especially with people like you that have circadian issues, napping is really the only type of solution. And we know that it's been around long time because it used to be there was first sleep and second sleep, because there are people who have always been there who couldn't sleep all the way through the night. And so they got a bit little and I did things and went back to sleep. So sometimes trying to solve for nature doesn't really work out well other than doing the thing that we don't want to do in the middle of day, which is not, but it can be a minimum of it can be effective even at 20 minutes. So anything about for both of you, her and her current situation and you just overall Me being able to create nap pods where you work in your offices. Yeah, that's what my fiance does He has in his companies because he cannot sleep I call him a vampire because he's pretty much never slaves and He's got these little like egg-shaped cocoon areas that are nap pods that he can use but also his employees can use too because there are people who just can't sleep and so there's Sounds there's weighted blankets All kinds of things to kind of descend someone to just sleep much faster and come out more rested so that's kind of cool.
00:13:37 - Michael F
Yeah, I I don't think I've ever gotten into a routine of taking a nap I'm just terrible at the willpower to get up But I guess if I had to have enough if I had an appointment that was coming up, I'd have to force myself up Yeah, that's I
00:14:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
to the world. I'm comatized. So I only nap when the only way that I'm getting through the day with any kind of productivity is I have to nap. I'm physically and cognitively would I would just be a zombie who did nothing and I existed for the rest of the day. And that's unacceptable to me so I'd rather nap and even if I had to take a two hour nap and it screws up my sleep schedule and I'm up till 11 I've got things to do. So everything in life is about trade-offs. That's a trade-off I'll make. But what happens is when I'm really exhausted, it is so hard to wake up.
00:14:34 - Michael F
So there's a few things that I do.
00:14:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll have something to drink next to me, sugar. Well, like a vitamin water, not a lot. Sugar, caffeine, something like that can do it.
00:14:44 - Michael F
Just having to get up to take care of my child automatically kicks adrenaline in.
00:14:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's chemical of one sort, even if it's my own chemicals. I can't be late to pick up my daughter. And that goes back to the whole kind of thing about energy sounds. is just purposely manipulating your energy to do what you want to the other thing that I'll do is I will set my alarm and give myself like a 40 minute wake up window when I read anything I could read a book I could read Facebook especially if I read news it just pisses me off so then I get mad but then again the adrenaline kicks in and it's not about engaging with it I don't actually have to care as soon as I read I'm like let's go I got stuff to do but learning what things like if you ever happen to notice is there a thing that wakes you up like I noticed one day that I was really really exhausted and there were two types of things that immediately triggered that my blood got pumping and I was ready to go with no other kind of help other than what I was reading and stimulating it was um something that made me really happy so a message from a friend a sister my sweetheart whatever That's just me and we go, oh, that's awesome, let's go, today's great. Or that is ridiculous, this world is crazy, I get ugh, whatever, and I'm up. It sounds like a stress response, but really I kind of feed off of opposition, so it's not, it's my motivator. But if you figure out what those triggers are for you, or build in a slow wake up, so let's say you take an app and you know that you're really groggy, and there was a podcast you wanted to listen to. If you are able to, now the podcast is going to put you back asleep, you can't do that. Or read it or whatever, but something that starts stimulating your brain so that the wake up process happens, and then just allowing for the time, but when you look at 40, 50, whatever, right, versus losing even two. hours, even if it's for a 20 minute nap and let's say front loading and back loading the slow down the wake up takes you two hours. But if you get to 80 capacity for the rest of the day, that's up to me.
00:17:14 - Michael F
I like that. Yeah, I think there's natural things like right now, I'm actually sitting outside of my daughter's preschool because I'm going to get her at 315. So like on days and I think I told you in jujitsu, right, we actually three months ago, we carved out my schedule so that on Monday and Wednesdays I finished at two and then I drive to her school. I get here by three and then actually I could just sit in this lot right here and nap for 15, 20 minutes, you know, and then that could be my nap on these days, Monday, Wednesdays at least. And then for Thursday, Friday, yeah, I don't know about that wake up window. could probably think of something but even when I'm tired, there's like nothing in the world. world that is interesting to me.
00:18:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I think if I have like a deadline, like a meeting at one o'clock or, you know, 130, then that's easy.
00:18:07 - Michael F
I just say, okay, well, I could sleep until 110 and then I have a meeting at 150. So yeah, that's interesting. It was three naps a week, three or four.
00:18:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it was what qualified as a napper was at least three naps consistently.
00:18:24 - Michael F
Okay, so during, yeah, that makes sense during the work week, try to get days when you're just zocked out.
00:18:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's yeah. And you seem to always have them a couple days where sleep really, really sucked. Right? So if you use them and if you can look kind of for what the pattern is and recognize, oh, this is one of those like minimal capacity days, but maximum, like I got a lot to do. You're like, okay, throw an app in here and do a little journaling and figure out, you know, how does that equation... eight and work out how much more productive are you what does it do to the rest of your nap and what I would do is on days where you take a nap also do something make sure that there's some sunshine because it helps with melatonin production at night and then any kind of movement you can get that day so if it's and it might be harder you might be able to you might have to switch days and figure out what that rhythm is because like for me if I exercise it takes me hours to wind down and be able to go to sleep depending on when it happens and you might not be able to work out or even do jujitsu when you're really sleepy are you ever too tired for jujitsu?
00:19:47 - Michael F
no that's like if there's a day I'm not working at noon I'm just like if I'm exhausted I'll still go I'm always like that like I could work out I mean I used to always work out when I was just exhausted
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
because once I did, then I would wake me up or... Right.
00:20:04 - Michael F
But...
00:20:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yeah. Anyway, all right. So those are some things to think about.
00:20:09 - Michael F
So... like the idea of napkin. Sometime ago, I did take a sleep class in med school, and I remember there was stuff about napkin, and you know, it is beneficial to you, and I remember even a seven-minute nap was better than 60 milligrams of caffeine in cognitive tests of recall. I don't know what that study was, like, you might find that one interesting, yeah, I was like, a seven-minute nap is equivalent or better to 60 milligrams of caffeine on cognitive recall tests, like how many things you remember, but yeah, but no, yeah, I like that idea. I'm just trying to make that little change and nap something enjoyable, it's not like something that I have to force myself to do. And I think if I could just carve out a little bit of time to nap, I think that would be really cool.
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll try to shoot for too 20 minutes to start and then figure out, you know, what are the things that maybe help you get there? So for me, pressure sound because my brain is too stimulated by certain types of things. But it's not human voices and outside activity. So like, if I was in a car, I could totally sleep because people don't bother me but it's sudden loud noises that will disrupt me or it's consistent conversation because my brain wants to tune into it, even if I really don't want it to. So things to keep, maybe in the car or with you all the time, earplugs and or headphones or earbuds, know, something where you can play some and figure out what frequencies work best for you, white noise, brown noise, peak noise, prone to pink and brown, especially brown noise, a mask, which may be too much of a signal in a parking lot, if the parking lot is safe. Yeah, think about those things you do. You don't want to already know you're not being so much, but if you have a cap pulled down low, you still get the pressure on your head, it still blocks the sun out of your eyes. It has the same kind of effect, but it doesn't really send a visual signal to everybody walking by necessarily that you're napping, especially if you're like holding your phone or whatever, like you could just be listening to something. Potentially they have little weighted, instead of weighted blankets, they have weighted, it's like a lap pad. Weighted things can help people get that faster. anyway, if you're really going to be on a mission of sleep hacking and trying to get the most rejuvenation, cognitive and physical performance out of the least, then find the things that get you there faster, that get you to REM sleep or deep sleep faster and as frequently as needed in order to be able to function at the way that you want to through life.
00:22:57 - Michael F
Yeah, I like that.
00:22:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we have I have the
00:23:00 - Michael F
I have like the headphones. I have three different eye masks that I alternate with. I've never tried a weighted blanket, but I'm interested in that. I'm always hot. I always thought I'd run hot. So that's why I love the car has like cool air conditioning all the time, so I'm always cool in here.
00:23:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you always keep a sheet on you though? Like do you always want to have some sort of, okay, so that's mostly like PTSD and trauma people. So that might not be something, which is why it's really good for people, a lot of people because so many people have been through trauma. So that might not even be anything that's beneficial to you.
00:23:41 - Michael F
It might be more fun.
00:23:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I I'm in my birthday suit, like just splaining out. Free and safe, free and safe. So napping then you have to just get, so maybe taking off your shoes and being barefoot.
00:23:56 - Michael F
I hope you get a nap better.
00:23:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just like if you're in a scrubs nothing constructing so that just all of those things and if you know like today I'm going to take a nap just making sure that that's the case maybe you've got some loose scrubs for nap days I don't know just all of the things and and you'll I think you'll notice over time that you figured out because you're being intentional and strategic about it it won't always work out that you can get it but you'll be able to operate at a higher level more often than not and catch up on sleep more often than not like I have gotten to the point where I don't even have to actually sleep I just have to lay down and close my eyes 20 minutes half an hour and I'm powering through the rest of the day like I actually slept and it's shocking me but I also did discover some really good things um dl phenolanaly it's an amino acid and it's pretty much replaced capping for me it's amazing and uh I did with depression and anxiety, that's gone. And, uh, gospel title sharing helps me with my ADD. Um, during the day helps me stay focused, helps me like, I was really experienced, especially in Perry, menopause, this type of the tongue thing. could not, I've got all the words except for one. And I can't, like, I feel the word, I know what it represents, but I could not say the one word. And so I haven't been dealing with that, but being a phospholipid, it, um, coats the cells so that they can communicate better. And, uh, you know, all of these little things. And then, um, the anything that helps with the neurotransmitters, because I do have those types of issues. They all help with sleep. Uh, things to think about and find out like what your issues are as we go through this. Okay. Um, to the spreadsheet now, you're not really where we can look at it on a good screen. And it's probably been a while. So I'm just going to go ahead and recap what you wrote. Hold on, me go back to my notes real quick.
00:26:10 - Michael F
I'll be easier for you to analyze. This is our second week trying it. Is it easier in the spreadsheet format like this?
00:26:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So when this becomes really actually the most effective is when you've done time tracking and we have more details on the things and I can see basically the inventory of your hours, where your time is going, how much of your time is going, and then so if you tell me that your most profitable activities face-to-face visits now, you could quantify that because you've got meanings tracked. So we could do some math on that and we could figure out what that is. But then there would be other conversations and we are about to start getting into spending most of our time on this business stuff. It was more important to me to figure out you getting the house cleaner, the assistant, having some of that, you know, this is groundwork. But, but come September, almost all of our calls, I'm going to want you to be in front of your computer, we're going to be going over data. of the time, anytime something comes up, you know, like we just can't do that, then what we will do is redirect the conversation to catching up more in detail long sleeve, probably little bit more philosophical, just different thoughts, those types of things, like we started in the beginning. so, as a natural kind of consequence of just life, and some of those coming up, this is how we kind of circle back, have the technical, analytical, and come back to the kind of philosophical, it's not really that, it's still practical and analytical, but it's just more about how we're thinking about things. So, you, let me go ahead and let's see.
00:27:56 - Michael F
I'm excited for the business data and the numbers because As, yeah, I I think I told you that's what burned to me in my first business, know, between 20, 17, essentially. six years of my fricking life, I wasted because I never looked at numbers. And I'm really so I'm really excited to have someone to, and even now I'm not really looking at my numbers.
00:28:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm really excited to have someone to, you know, force me to look at the numbers with me. We can start. That doesn't have to wait till September. I'm glad that you're excited. So let me look at next week. Because you're just getting back to week, but that doesn't mean that still have my bookkeepers are still sending me monthly, you know, monthly balance sheets.
00:28:45 - Michael F
I have no idea how to read a balance sheet, but I'm pretty good at P&L now. But, you know, those are stuff that I can always look at. And yeah, my bank statements, of course. And yeah.
00:28:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. know what's helpful for you or what what we can do to optimize things, what you need, but um, I usually don't go deeper than P and L's and depending on how segmented some of the accountant get with that stuff, sometimes my eyes glaze over and I'm like, I want to get that deep, but yeah, I have a detail of P and L that my bookkeepers do and a condensed P and L that I've created with them in a PDF document. So we could show you both and that would be great. Um, and then just kind of going over them in detail. So the things that we're looking for first is, is anything bloated? anything bleeding? if I ask you about something and you're like, I don't really know about any of it, then I want to dig deeper into that. Are you just wasting money? Because everybody, not everybody, but so far, everybody I've worked with has had that happening at some point where it was an expense that got started and is no longer really as valuable or or efficient or something like that. we'll look at that. But then what we're looking for too is, so, because this is driving me nuts, got something in my eye and I just won't. I wanna get it out, but busy. so like looking at most profitable activities, you have Q and E face to face visits. So what do you do that generates those visits?
00:30:27 - Michael F
How do you get more of those? Yeah, that's a good question. It's a lottery system. Well, just take a step back. I have 10 offices in Northern California, and I roughly visit each of those once a month. And I step clients, I try to stack as many clients into those days, so I just have to go once. So to get a person, it's a lottery system based on how close that office is to an injured person that's claiming a work injury. So that's why I go to. like random cities that are highly populous and more blue collared so that because that's where injured people are. So in terms of like how I get more lottery hits, I have like a list of the most popular zip codes in California and I do look at that every about every year and I can kind of move locations within zip codes to find where the injured people are living in zip codes so we've tried to optimize that for the most part in our current we can only have 10 locations that's why I'm not doing like 20 but we try to optimize as best we can and that's how we've come up with our current 10 locations but I think there's more that we could do like if we kept switching them out but yeah part about switching them out is it takes about it's about it takes three months to close one location and then as soon as that's closed it takes about three to three to four months to ramp up on the next, so you're looking at like a cycle of six months to replace every one of my 10 locations. Yeah, so that's why like as long as we're maintaining at least three or four hits of the lottery every month, we're okay with that's that's what we've been doing. There's there has been locations that have gotten me less than two lottery picks a month. Those are the ones like in San Francisco, no one picked me ever in the lottery. So I cut that and I switched it to Merced, California. So that's that's the most recent switch we made.
00:32:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So one thing, do you have a report of like a spreadsheet or anything tracked where you have how many lottery hits that you get each month for each location?
00:32:48 - Michael F
I do, yes.
00:32:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Esther's manager has that.
00:32:52 - Michael F
Is that something that could be shared with me so that I could Absolutely. Yeah, I would love to see that I haven't looked at it in a box since I changed locations.
00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, what was that?
00:33:02 - Michael F
About three months ago.
00:33:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I don't even know if I have any.
00:33:07 - Michael F
Yeah. Yeah. Let me, let me collect that. That's easy to collect. I'll just ask for a minute. Okay.
00:33:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to put that on my list.
00:33:25 - Michael F
There's also little like, you know, games that are played because the more doctors that do what I do in a particular zip code, that have an office in that same zip code is me, the less lottery hits I get, right?
00:33:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's not just a population of how many people live in San Jose.
00:33:41 - Michael F
It's how many doctors just like me are in that zip code and that dilutes my lottery pick. So that's why I went to Merced to try to see if there's more fertile ground where there's less people willing to go out there. But it is two hours away.
00:33:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's two and a half hours away. So do you get a monthly report of? injuries in the location and that doctors existing in the location?
00:34:04 - Michael F
No, it's a report that I asked California for. California keeps how many lottery, lottery generated in each zip code. And then they keep track of how many doctors are in each code. So I can see how many injured workers there are, lottery hits, and I can see how many doctors per zip code. So I can request that report from the state.
00:34:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I haven't done that. I can that monthly.
00:34:30 - Michael F
I could.
00:34:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I haven't. I haven't in like six months since I chose. If when we get to an assistant or somebody figure out if there's anybody that exists that you delegate this to, but deputize somebody to do that every month and to get it to you, you shouldn't be doing it, but you should be looking at it.
00:34:50 - Michael F
So is there already somebody that exists who would have the ability to accomplish that for you and who counted on it? Our manager should, you know, she's I'm a risk master's manager should probably be the one to do this because, um, yeah, that's her. That's wonderful job just to make sure we stay in business and the job, right?
00:35:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, so let's, let's make sure that that gets done and you're looking at that every month because then you can, um, do projections more accurately and rather than be proactive, like watch, there's an adjustment, but also sometimes, um, this probably because you have so many locations, you're probably a really good sense of what's actually happening with it. The doctor population is something you wouldn't be aware of unless you're looking at it. And so let's say the doctor population is decreasing steadily and you don't know. And you're wondering, so, so there's a couple of things that I think that could happen that you may not necessarily know that that walk watching it every month could tell you. of all, if doctors are leaving, why are they leaving? Do they know something? You don't know. Has there been some legislation change that's creating issues in the business that hasn't caught up with you yet that maybe you don't want to be in that location, whatever, I don't know, the state versus local government, probably not too much of a big deal for regulations. but also, let's say, because it's a lottery, you're not getting any hints for little long, you're like, I got to pull out and go somewhere else. But simultaneously, doctors are leaving, retiring, moving, whatever. You don't know why they're moving. You just know that they're not there. Maybe instead of pulling out, you want to ride that wave out a little bit longer because the population's going. So, and you know, if you're going to be doing this for a long time, let's say, five, 10, 15, 20 years, whatever, maybe not that long. But the longer that you're going to do it, the more data you have, two things. If you're going to sell it, all the data that you have makes it more sellable, or if you ever wanted to get investors, probably not. But I'm just saying data that's There's so many different reasons why you want to have as much as possible. And as far as KPIs, that performance indicator or, I can't think of the other word that I want, it's not KPIs, whatever, but those those those indicator numbers of what could have an impact on the business, doctor population being one of them, injuries and injuries will have a correlation to industry. So let's say the industry is expanding or shrinking, if it's expanding, more injuries are going to be And that's another thing too, if you if you watch that. So we just want to have more information, track it, track it regularly, bottom line.
00:37:38 - Michael F
I like the idea, it's something that I know I should look at and I know, actually I remember why I haven't put my manager in is because in this industry, not a lot of people know you can get that data. It's called the Public Relations Act, actually you could get it, anyone can get it, you have to make a public relations data act from California and a lot of the my competitors don't know about. this. So they just kind of blindly pick locations. But I've known about this for a while. That's why I haven't given my manager this data. Only me and Esther know about it as much as we trust our manager.
00:38:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is a very small You find an NDA because even though they're really only worth as much as you're willing to go to war with, most people are more afraid of them because they don't know that.
00:38:24 - Michael F
Okay, that's a good idea. Just like be like, hey, this is part of your- yeah, give her the NDA to sign and then be like, okay, I have this confidence. So remember, Swiss, when you learn, help people make the right decisions.
00:38:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or relation is, here's your NDA. Go do this. Oh, I better not tell anybody. Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea. I don't think we've ever had our sign in NDA. mean, you should anyway because you're a doctor. I think just anything about your business. You have a specific unique business. They're as you involved. Again, they're only as good as you're willing to fight for and go to war over, but most people don't know that.
00:39:10 - Michael F
Yeah, make it easy to be tempted to share the data freely. Go on webinar and speak about, yeah, Dr.
00:39:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Food, your request to this report tells you all the data. Yep. And sometimes you can help people understand too, because sometimes people are just like, well, I'm just telling Billy Bob over here. Billy Bob doesn't know anything. Billy Bob doesn't do anything like that. You don't know who Billy Bob knows and who he talks to. He might have a friend that's in a similar business and they just have to be chatting. Oh, yeah, I heard about this thing that this guy did. And now your competitor knows it. So people are more connected than we think. They have more conversations than we think. So just say like, the safest thing is, you just don't discuss this outside of this office, period, end of story. And you could say it in the Fuji way, not the Tina with the I'll cut you eyeballs. I'm not finding a violin or anything. I'm calm. It's the sweeper in me playing soccer that is like you will not pass that has never died.
00:40:11 - Michael F
So funny.
00:40:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
okay, so sales calls to law firms for July medical. So what is an interesting one? Yeah, what generates the sales calls? What is the rhythm to that? What are like, tell me everything all around that and then I'll formulate more questions.
00:40:40 - Michael F
Well, when I started this business, um, July, this is completely so this is July medical. This is the one I worked with Mark. Mark's law firm on. I had no clients like who's going to send their client to a telehealth doctor when they can go to an in-person doctor, right? So, um, initially, I, I look back at the business that I. close with my partner and I took the whole list of everyone that had ever sent me a patient from that business and then I just literally tried to get on the phone with them and yeah I would just try to the case managers that work for those law for I found that lawyers don't do anything the lawyers don't maybe mark those but those lawyers don't it's the case managers that give me business they send their clients to me so I just got that list from my old clinic and I just called them and thankfully most of them remembered my clinic remembered my reports and I had to explain to them yeah I do the you know I do this on televisits but I'm like a quarterback and then yeah a couple of them got it so you know I got a couple referrals the first month and I just kept doing that up until about I did it for about the first six months and once I got to about six months into the business which was September of last year I kind of cut back on doing that because I just had I was I was getting good traction anyway and you know I was
00:42:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
moments are right though.
00:42:01 - Michael F
If you're not moment to mean you're dying.
00:42:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're moment to be. You're either getting or losing but you're never you never stagnant really. So be purposely intentionally. So one of the things I'd like you to consider is where in your schedule and.
00:42:25 - Michael F
Well I just not on that note. It was actually a conscious decision that Mark and I had talked about. In this in personal injury it's quite litiginous and the insurance companies will come after the doctors actually more so than the lawyers because we don't have patient client privilege and so they could take my deposition, take me to court. So at the point where my business was getting between like three to four hundred visits a month which is where I've been at for like last six months. Eight months now. That was in September, and that's when Mark and I were like, you know, if I get too big, I'm going to stick out, especially because I'm... So we actually sort of like throttled it, because if I kept getting, and what I do now is I kind of cherry pick my referrals, like I actually started turning away some, like for instance, there's a class of injury called slip and balls or dog bites, and those are highly litiginous because it's like, well, how do you know they slipped, right? There's no... It's hard to prove, and so the doctors get questioned a lot. So I actually stopped in like December, I stopped taking that with Mark's help, and now I turn away all that business, even though it could make me like a lot more money, right? But that was the way that I've, instead of like increasing the number, I've tried to pick better cases.
00:44:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so what I do you have, anything where you've done the map, a spreadsheet, a calculator of volume over quality and what that looks like to your revenue line over time?
00:44:18 - Michael F
No, it's hard because I don't get paid, I don't get paid for about maybe like 18 months to two years, like I haven't gotten paid for, like some have started paying me, but it usually takes like maybe a year, 18 months to get paid.
00:44:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm aware of that because of mark stuff.
00:44:38 - Michael F
Yeah, it's freaking wild.
00:44:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So don't you, don't you know though in roughly six months what the amount's gonna be supposed to be?
00:44:52 - Michael F
Well, I mean, I can, I have like my spreadsheet and I can tell you right now how much I expect from each case. case, like, my average. So yeah, I could apply that. Really, I'm just looking at how many cases I get in a month, right?
00:45:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I just multiply that by 300. So there's multiple things. Like, first of all, we look at the case volume, we look at attorney fees, which is, and I don't know, is there a variation of how much you get paid? There's not right? That's like always the same for every case.
00:45:27 - Michael F
I mean, if the lawyer does really well, like the average, like, I haven't done it in a while, but each law firm has a different average, right? sweet laws average is about 500 per case, but my law firms are like 300, right? but I just use 300 in my head because I'm like, well, that's the most conservative thing.
00:45:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so what I was getting at is that there are certain data points.
00:45:56 - Michael F
How many cases come in?
00:45:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many get settled? a month, how many get paid out?
00:46:03 - Michael F
That's right.
00:46:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So now he has Lidify in Salesforce. Do you have, do you just use spreadsheets?
00:46:13 - Michael F
Like where do you track your cases? When I get a check, I have a Google spreadsheet that is, I've mirrored it. So I've created a second Google spreadsheet off the first one that no one else can see except me. And then when I get a check, I just find their name and put how much money I got to get the call.
00:46:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's a better system.
00:46:36 - Michael F
Yeah, yeah. It's hard to track my month. I have no idea how much I got per month, except for my bookkeepers will tell me.
00:46:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Would it be helpful to have just one of our calls just be devoted to that business and bring Mark in for some of his ideas?
00:46:52 - Michael F
Also, no, this is not a judgey thing. This is just because he and I have worked together.
00:46:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So also, it'll help me not feel stupid because I When I get into a new business, there's so much I don't know, but I'm in here and I got to be confident and ask these questions, so this is me telling you you're not the only one, like we're all trying to figure out how to do the best thing where we're at. And we all have different skill sets that we bring to the table so, you know, my experience doing the same things over and over again in different businesses. I mean, again, I've got lots of years on you. Lots of years of practice, lots of watching my own thoughts, watching other people's faults and seeing that there are certain things to do. I'm not raising brand new babies anymore. Like, there's so many different things. But even with all of that, there's way more that I don't know that I do know, and it always will be like that. So, you know, but I was just thinking that for two things. Just his mark has been ideas, and it would help me understand your dynamic a little bit better too. to be able to see that in action on a call. I feel like I might feel like a third wheel with a romance that goes on. so we'll talk about that. would you share with me? And if you if you can, because I don't know if you can with so you do not get privileged with your with these people because that's accidents or how does that work?
00:48:36 - Michael F
Yeah, everything that I do pretty much is discoverable under with a subpoena. Yeah, it's very uncomfortable. Like they can even go as far as text message. That's why Mark and I communicate on signal because those delete and I have all my staff message on signal, all our calls are on signal. But yeah, unfortunately, everything is. I mean, like sharing, sharing data with consultants, sharing data with accountants, bookkeepers, that's not a problem.
00:49:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, because what I would like to see is basically anything that you have that you track any of your business. So what would be really helpful is, okay, this is the record, anything that you can do to give me a full understanding of why you do it, why you do it this way, what it tracks, how long you've been tracking it, that type of thing. That honestly, if that was all that we accomplished over the next couple of weeks is transferring that data so I could start kind of wrapping my head around it so that I can formulate the best questions. But here's the thing I want you to always think about when you're planning out your day, when you're planning out your week, when you're planning out your month, when you're planning out your quarter, and I don't even know if you think about it in terms of quarterly goals and things like that, that would have been my guess. Which is okay, we're just really getting track to like you're just very brand new on your own, you know, I never. used to think like that. It's really only been probably the last 10 years that I've been working that way and I could improve a lot and I do the quotes because so for example I have Mark and I think I told you to read Emith. lot of these business type books assume values that I have that I don't have and then I never will have. For example Mark's value is if I want to go in the office for month I'm not going to go into the office for a month. Now almost anybody who's a business consultant is going to say you're insane that's stupid you can't run a business like that. I would not because I would say you're not going to run the best business that way. There's going to be a lot that's going to suffer that way but there's trade-offs. If you have enough leaders in the business it's profitable. Your people are happy and your highest value is the freedom. to do what you want to with your time, I think you created the perfect thing. And business books and business courses don't approach things like that. They will give you that judge you kind of like, well, you could do better. You could hire someone, you could do this. Yeah, it's, but everything comes with more stress, every person that you hire, it's more stressed, it's more responsibility, it's more expectations. And we've already talked about how failure to mean expectations is where most stress and anxiety comes from. The more people you involve, and the more, you know, you're like, these are our goals, this is what we're doing, the more you have expectations that you have to meet. So if your higher value is flexibility, and fluidity in life, so that you can be a free agent across the board, then the trade-offs are going to be, you're going to lose some of the structure, and you're going to lose some of the benefit of the structure and momentum, but you're going to maintain that autonomy. and that freedom throughout your life. So you're leveraging everything as much as you can, not for the sake of revenue. Revenue is feeding the autonomy. Revenue is the secondary thing. The autonomy and the freedom is the first thing, which is generally who I'm working with, because yeah, I could do all of that, I don't want to. I don't either. I could have been a valedictorian and I'm like, that's way too much effort. I don't want to study. I will, whatever I accumulate during the class, that's it. I still graduated with honors, but I did zero homework. Zero studying. I'm just like, why? I'd rather play soccer. rather do this. I'd rather do that. I'd rather go, yeah. cheerleader and football and track and softball and tennis. Is that everything?
00:52:52 - Michael F
Basketball.
00:52:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like to play. I still like to play a lot. So. You're you're in the season of parenthood. So we'll take all those things are in the count, but when What time is it?
00:53:08 - Michael F
When do we start?
00:53:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, 15 When you're looking at these things I Always want you to start now. You're probably not gonna be looking at this in the week But but I would like you to just glance at this at least once a week for little while while you're starting to consider Time-blocking Which is not necessarily something you're going to do On a physical level like putting into the calendar you can and we can talk about that I Do mental time blocks because that's how loose I keep my calendar There are some things that are physically on there. They're the appointments. They're the meanings Everything else is I am keeping kind of a mental note of the types of things that I want to do and I always know what my priority is I always know I'm always thinking about it. So I always know and also because I've been doing it so long and it's so steady. I don't have to do that. But I still do on occasion come back and look at things like this myself. So you've got in these two businesses. Now QME is the one that makes all the money right now, right?
00:54:17 - Michael F
Yeah. And that's the freedom thing and it's why I July because as long as I'm doing QMEs, I have to do face to face like today, right? There's no getting around that. Like I know that at least 10 days a month, have to 10 days a month or maybe eight, depending on if it's full or not. But like at least eight days a month, I have to be somewhere and that, yeah, I think it's good for the amount of money it makes.
00:54:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, I mean, a long term, I would like to off for a month.
00:54:52 - Michael F
And not have to worry about that. So that's why that's a big reason why I like July and why I'm just kind of foster it.
00:55:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, for those purposes, the thing that you want to be thinking about with the QME is how do we maximize lottery hits, which is retracting the data and seeing what it is. And we can use some AI to look at the reports, too, instead of having just brain fatigue going over and trying to look at patterns we might be missing. And we can do that. And I'll show you how, even if you already use it, almost every time I show somebody something, I process it differently. And so there's a new thought, oh, I didn't think to do it this way. So we'll do that. And so every week, you at least ponder multiple times throughout the week, is there anything I can do to increase these visits? If you just think of it like, no, not really, but you still want it to be kind of at the back of your mind constantly, so that you're intuitive. except there's a kind of just on that, you know what I mean? You might hear a conversation about something that just was like, maybe I should be looking in this area, whatever. So just the kind of thinking about it just increases your perception or opportunities that might be out, or threats. And for a July medical, we want to figure out what levers there are. So, you want to make sure you don't have opposing goals. Sorry. This smoke is super bad here today.
00:56:34 - Michael F
The air quality is like 281.
00:56:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The fires are so bad.
00:56:38 - Michael F
Where are you again?
00:56:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Southern Oregon. Commathals. I don't know if you're part of it. It's a hit though. But yeah, but we get everybody's smoke. It just lands on our basin. What was I thinking? Okay, so you have to watch for opposing goals. If the goal is July medical is your path to freedom, but you're trying to stay under the radar, so you're not growing. Do those conflict?
00:57:11 - Michael F
Yes. Yes.
00:57:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do. And if autonomy is the ultimate goal, then are you going to live your life based off of fear of competition? I would say that's a terrible way to live. You have to decide what's the most important thing. Now, I'm not saying don't mitigate those risks in whatever ways that you can. What I'm saying is that we figure out are there other ways to do that. So those are longer conversations.
00:57:52 - Michael F
They're not necessarily longer conversations. They're ongoing conversations.
00:57:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
These are the kind of things where answers reveal themselves because we're intentionally looking for them. solutions. But you have to decide and you already have, but you need to make sure also that you're on the same page with whoever you're talking to, including Mark. But if your priority is July medical is your path to being as free as you want with your time, then that has to be the price. Originally, priority didn't even have it was it was singular.
00:58:24 - Michael F
There was no plural form of the word. Yeah, that's true. I can imagine. It was just there was there was one.
00:58:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's the one thing. I see now we have multiple and and they're right. But there has to be one greatest above all priority. Okay. And that should be autonomy because that insinuates and implies that you've got the financial resources that like I talk about these three different currencies, time, energy, and money that that that autonomy or freedom means that you've got all of what you want and need sufficiently. at least, right? And you want for nothing. And everything else feeds that goal. So you maximize how they feed that goal. There is, by nature of life, an enemy in opposition to all things. So if you're constantly focusing on the enemy in the opposition, what you're not focusing on is the growth.
00:59:29 - Michael F
Oh, yeah, that's absolutely right in July right now.
00:59:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but what we think about comes about where we put our energy and mind to, that's what increases. If you're focused on the scarcity and the threat, that's which you're increasing and manifesting. And if you're focusing on the growth, if there's sufficient growth, it mitigates competition anyway. If you're networking so well and taking care of of the people that send you business, the attorneys, if they're just falling in love with you like Mark's tweeted, what do you care if there's competition? They're going to cut you out? No. Also, I fully believe you can't take what's mine and you can't take what's Fuji's. It's either for you or it's not. So even if that's wrong, we know that there is evidence from MRIs, from all kinds of things that show what our brains do when we believe things, when we focus on things. It activates us. We behave differently. So you just have to make a choice of am I going to focus on playing small, on purpose, on purpose is what you just told me or being free.
01:00:58 - Michael F
Yeah, that's a it's a good point. I mean, yeah, I've been just staying kind of small since September of last year. Really, I haven't pushed growth at all. I'm just, yeah, it's been nice. It's, I don't know, nice, but it's kind of bruising and we're growing in the right way, I think, but I'm not really pushing it at all.
01:01:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, it's kind of weird, huh? It is weird.
01:01:20 - Michael F
Well, and there is definitely something to be said about keeping the guardrails on so that you don't grow too big, that it becomes a problem.
01:01:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But then if you're looking at scaling, then, then a part of that is hiring the right kind of person, hiring somebody who can help it grow so that it doesn't become a burden, like Mark has Mary, but also he's got some really great attorneys and he's investing and coaching in them to make them better leaders. And we've done things like more surveys to find out what their weaknesses are. what are the things that they feel like they need to know. So we've got um grief counseling for the intake people so that they could learn how to have those conversations with people who have lost loved ones because they died. It's some of the the intake people they're like that is really heavy. I don't know how to deal with that because they feel that other person's energy and it was hard on them. And that had never been addressed before until we asked the surveys and in a particular way like his net promoter score surveys were useless to me. I'm like you're not asking anything that is very corporate-esque and it says I'm asking you because I feel like I have to ask you I don't really care. So we changed the questions and then the other thing that we found out is that people feel like they're not good at sales calls which we already knew but the fact that they're aware of it and they want to be better is wonderful. So we went and got black something. I can't remember what it is. Anyway, and they came in and they taught sales. And her best attorney, just from reading their book, like, she already figured out a strategy that was making her money immediately. Sam, yep. so, and it wasn't that everybody was better across the board from all of these things. It was that there were pockets of improvement, but they wouldn't have existed without finding out what they needed. That wouldn't have existed if Mark did invest in coaching for himself and caring about leadership. So his goal still is, I don't really want to go into the office. And so, my job is to figure out how do we make the best out of all of these things as much as they can be without you going in and being a leader and overseer. He's still leading, but he's leading from a recliner because that's what he wants. nothing wrong with that. I mean, he's still like, he's hard working, he's doing lots of things, he's just not in the office with his people. And statistically, that's not what you think of as somebody leading, you know, there. But he's happy with it. It's also not the most profitable thing, but Mark has been growing happier and happier and happier since I've known him. I used to call him Eor. That's funny. Because I'd say how you think he's I'd say, okay, bye, have a great day. He's like, yeah. Okay, yours and Tiggers, you know, he has a Tigger.
01:04:51 - Michael F
That's so funny.
01:04:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, and now he just, he almost never has that energy. And when he does, he automatically is like, yeah. But this is what's good, and this is what's good, and this is what's good, and I'm like that's my boy right there So It's all it's all the process anyway. Oh crap the time. Geez Okay So I want you to start thinking more about how do you get more of your most profitable activity or More out of your most profitable activity. So you're not necessarily trying to spend more time doing it But trying to milk what you can out of it sometimes it's more time and then How we can support that the other work activities? This is where time tracking comes in we want to figure out what we can delegate and so if you look at it and go These are things also. What is not getting done? That should be done. Go ahead and put that down there and we'll highlight that in a different way Things that you know should be happening in your business, but isn't we want that list And then step two, oh, you did, no, I knew you didn't. Okay, yeah, step two. I really want you to fill out step two because what that is is things that energize you, things that drain you. it ranks how good you are at stuff. So that helps with delegation, but it also helps us figure out where's the sharpening of the saw activities that we need to do. And even if we're only putting a little bit of saw sharpening activities monthly, right? The pace is gonna be dictated by you and what you wanna do. But categorizing the things that you do across profitability and then energy and then skill really helps us rank where the time goes so that we can get the most out of it and also how we can utilize other people to get the most out of your existing team and assets and kind of future pace and figure out What would come next in order to get you to more of the profitable either activities or higher leverage profitable activities? Yep, I like that plan Okay All right, so I will send you some notes and In a few minutes because otherwise I might forget and I don't want to do that And then I will talk to you Monday cool.
01:07:25 - Michael F
I have my alarm set this time, and I will not miss it I have two three four alarms back up And always tuned it if you want to because my Mondays are crazy long but that you said that that was consistently the best for you Monday is the most consistent day that I have all four.
01:07:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:07:44 - Michael F
Yeah, so Good luck.
01:07:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I only work one Monday a month generally So I didn't Quality to protein and take the day before And just let me know did you did anything pop out to you.
01:08:03 - Michael F
Okay. Okay. was good.
01:08:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Any questions or anything?
01:08:08 - Michael F
No, thank you so much for scheduling.
01:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

> 00:00:02 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Hello, 18 a good morning.
00:00:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good morning.
00:00:05 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
How are you? I'm doing good. How are you?
00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good, I'm glad to speak with you today. Um, have you had any kind of background about about what this conversation would be about or what to expect or anything?
00:00:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
No.
00:00:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mark is so good for that. Um, Well, um, so I've been working with Mark for the last three years as actually a client of mine and I started working with him kind of partially on business systems teams whatnot. Um, I would call myself a business consultant. He calls me a coach names, whatever. My goal is basically just to help people optimize their business, but for them. It's not really all about the numbers. It's kind of more about the overall just quality of life, um, quality of operations, quality of team. I take a holistic approach to everything. Um, and basically the end result is that people end up being happier. So that's not how I started. I started out just trying to get the most out of the least because I'm that girl. I'm like, I don't want to work all day, but I want all the things. So yeah, I would, I've been a single mom for a very long time. And I also like playing and coaching soccer and doing all kinds of things. So I was like, how do I optimize this stuff? Got really good at it, helped people with it. But the end result was that as I was doing business, I ended up finding some things just made me really kind of angry, honestly, working with bad clients, working with bad people on teams, just being overwhelmed. then I'd go be kind of sharp with my girls and then I'd watch my four very strong will daughters ricochet that attitude across the house back and forth and so I learned that there were some things I needed to cut out and so some systems and processes were born out of Yeah, so that's where we started I've been working with Mark for three years, sweet lot has grown a lot since then in terms of how many retainers we get per month versus so when we started it was about 33 per month and now we're averaging about 90. But the team hasn't actually grown that much so we didn't have the Arizona office then and obviously your new since then and I think that we have lost one attorney since then so there really hasn't been a lot of team growth. growth in order to support that, which is speaking to the optimization of what is done, if that makes sense.
00:03:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Right.
00:03:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so last year, I met with Samantha and Lorenz, and we had one conversation, and we talked a little bit just about leadership, because it was more an exploratory call, like, happens if we talk to the attorneys, not the business owner that hired me. And Samantha wasn't interested. That's okay. I'm not for everybody. This process isn't for everybody, but Lorenz kind of around with it. And so we had a conversation that he was particularly interested in, and I'm telling you this because the approach is different for everyone. So what you're interested in and what might be beneficial to you may have nothing to do with anybody else, and I'm not interested in doing anything that's not helpful to you or not interesting to you. So keep that in mind. But what he was interested in is the fact, first of all, Samantha puts up big numbers and she beats everybody. She beats everybody in terms of attorney fees and how many cases she does. I don't know if you know that, but she does.
00:04:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I figured, I figured.
00:04:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but her approach is different and her approach doesn't work for everybody. You know, there are different types of personalities inside of Sweet Law. There's been shifting around, you know, different case managers on different teams, different assistants on different teams, things like that. And a lot of that, Mark has driven based on conversations with different attorneys and just finding who works best with there.
00:04:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
So that's one little type of tweet, right?
00:04:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. But for Lorenz, he saw those numbers and he's like, I could do better. I want to do better, but I don't know how to do better. And so, after having a conversation with him, I figured out something that I thought would work for him and I give him a book called multiple. pliers. And that is how to make better leaders out of everybody around you. So instead of him, because he didn't feel like he was really bringing the best out of the people on his team, and also he didn't feel that that was his strength. So I gave him that book and he had a couple of aha moments, but fast forward three months later, and he almost was doubling his monthly numbers. So, you know, that that's that's some good results. And he was interested in this. So I don't know what might be good for you. I know you're fairly new. New to Sweet Law. Now, I don't know how new you are as an attorney.
00:05:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
know you're a younger one attorney. don't know if you practiced anywhere else before. No, I'm coming up on just putting my second year and know that.
00:05:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Why did you become an attorney?
00:05:55 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
My uncle was an attorney and when I was a kid, my guy was just following his footsteps. I saw it was like a lucrative opportunity. I feel like the type of work is things that I'm able to tolerate more than most people would. So I do feel like it's something that because I know the average time for an attorney is like five years before they kind of make a decision on what they want to do. They want to go somewhere else, you know, but I'm cool like the work that I do coming in here talking to clients, getting like, you know, complained at why is the number this or, you know, just juggling things. I just feel like I have a good tolerance for that and I can just crank work out. Now, there's like two sides to being a lawyer, like some are in court all the time, some are, you know, doing what we do here where we're just office dealing with clients, which I feel like is better for for me, which is why I pick this area, but if I have friends that are attorneys, they're like, I can't do what you do. Like, it's just boring. But for me, I'm like, I don't want go on court once in my career. You know, so I don't know. I like what I do. And I just feel like I have what it takes to make a good living off of it. And it's cool. Like, we have this one case, the kid was like 22 years old, pretty big injuries. And the money that we got for him, he was able to pay off school that he's going to. things like that are cool to know that, like, you know, that took a chance in hiring us and we were able to change a portion of his life, which is pretty cool. On every case is like that, some clients always complain about the money that they get. But every now and then you. get something cool where you feel good about about what you do. So, that's good.
00:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good insight that that helps me actually to learn a lot about you. So you would you consider yourself pretty easy going?
00:08:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I mean, my my requirements are like very low as long as I have a few hours to go to the gym during the day. That's all I really care about. Well, coming to work early, you would have to do pretty high patients level. did go to a military college, so things that would probably stress people out more or like start to freak out a little bit earlier. I typically have like a longer range of where I'm able to tolerate it before it gets to that point, which why I'm like just so chill at work because I've been through so much.
00:09:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nothing.
00:09:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, this is nothing, you know, um, yeah, I'm a pretty talent person. Like, I don't, or how many needs, you know, but do you feel like do you feel driven or do you feel like I'm just like meandering kind of through life and it's just chill and is really big goals? just don't like I'm the type of person I'll just rather do the work than just, you know, talk talk about, you know, what my big plans are or like, I keep a lot of things to myself and like, yeah, you like blink in like two years later, it's like, whoa, how did Pat get there? It's like, you know, putting in the work like after high school, I went straight to college. After college, I went straight to law school like never really did you live in like, kind of a poverty or like gang area or anything when you were younger? No. And then I parents weren't like really well off, but We weren't like on food stamps or anything like that.
00:10:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, not necessarily that you were poor, but that was it around you.
00:10:12 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
No, not really.
00:10:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. you just have a. You remind me of a lot of people that had like lived in tough neighborhoods coming up, you know, and so I was just wondering, I was curious about that. So I know that you hope you kind of keep things close to the chest, but would you share any of your professional goals with me?
00:10:41 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I mean, I'm two years in. Obviously, like the first day I got here, I saw that like Sam was the highest. So there's like a competitive nature, but so a lot of respect. Because when Mark hired me, I didn't really have any experience in this. field, first that I had when I first started now, obviously like I got more cases and have a team now, but like I always joke around with their teller like, because I don't have as many cases as she does, so obviously I can't really get the numbers there, but you know, obviously my goal is to be the one that does leading the firm as far as the numbers go, just from a competitive standpoint, obviously every month like things change, but I love that. Because I know I'm still pretty young, but, you know, some months I'd be Lauren's or I don't know if you've met Tyler before. And I have like half the cases that they do. So like, to me, that's like my way of showing that, you know, because I'm obviously they're older, they have more experience and education, but that's my way of trying to get respect that like, hey, I just got here and I'm, you know, starting to make my mark. So that's really important for me.
00:12:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. So do you keep track of stats like how long it takes your cases, what percentage of the time you're hitting a max settlement and what's the other one? Just how many cases you're taking? Like, I know that you're given cases. But what are you doing in terms of monitoring those numbers? and trying to push them, if anything.
00:13:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I mean, I have a list of cases that get settled every month, so I see a daily track of what the number is for that month for settlements and how much the attorneys fees we brought in. There's also like a little note on there if it's settled for the policy limits.
00:13:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not sure if you know what that is. Yep, that's what I meant to say when I said how much, yeah.
00:13:29 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, so obviously every case we pushed for that, but it doesn't always work out that way. Right. know Mark keeps a better track of how many policy limits cases we get. I don't know if so many cases were because I can keep a lot of things in my mind, like right now because I don't know as many, but I'm really on top of the numbers. Because that's obviously the indicator that, you know, Boss looks at to see where everybody's at you are you able to see that and let if I The list do you have access to you have access to let if I everybody does right?
00:14:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, okay, so we've been working on the dashboard for the last three years This has been a whole long process and and one of the things is just really trying to put together the numbers and a really clear way That are important that help us figure out. Okay. How are we performing? Across the board. How are we performing across attorneys and pods? How are we performing across? Types of cases how are we performing across? Vendors who bring us the leads because we have several different vendors that bring us leads They all perform differently how are we performing across states? So like we're really analyzing breaking everything down and You know how it is any anywhere you go you've got some people that come in to collect paychecks And we've got
00:15:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
uh people that come in because they got missions to accomplish and goals to accomplish and then we got people that are just in there trying to slam everybody like there's a whole spectrum right of how they show up and um so um you said that there was something that like sometimes that at night you'll think about like what you could do better what are some of the things that i've popped up in your head um just being more efficient on certain tasks because when i started it was just me with my case load and then in january i got a case manager and then like march i got an assistant um so i'm just doing every piece of the case myself um now obviously i have people who are being paid to help me um so it's more like let me focus on certain things that are gonna that i need To do, for example, negotiating or, you know, pushing certain cases out, monitoring, that's one of the things I did the last month is going through the case load early and figuring out why something is stuck, or how can I move it forward? Because the more cases you get, some things start to slip and get stuck. Mark does a good job of going through our cases, too, reminding us like, hey, you know, this one can be moved and get done this month. So just kind of trusting another person to do their job, see like things that kind of slip. Because when I first cut a team, I was like, well, this is great. Just let them know what they're supposed to do right. I'm like, okay, you guys go do that. I'll go do this. And then I started looking through the cases and like certain things are being missed. So I know that I can just give these people 100%.
00:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I love that you've noticed that. And so you have Cynthia, right?
00:17:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
And she used to be on the rental team. Yeah.
00:17:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so like, one of the things that he learned about her is that she is very systems and processes oriented, like she needs to have structure. Whereas he said a lot of other people that he's worked with, they don't, they're just like, you know, they roll with whatever. But she likes to have the documented, she likes to be like step by step. Do you feel like you've noticed that also or noticed anything about how she works?
00:17:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, she is like that. But now she's a little bit because for like a good three months, it was just her and I. So, and I didn't know I was going to get other help. So I kind of trained her to, you know, be proactive and not necessarily have to wait for me to task her for every little thing and be like, look, when we get this case, these are the three things that always need to get done. You know, after a month or two, distance to get done. So now she's a little bit more, she's still like very task oriented, but she's still now, she's little bit more proactive where she knows certain things have to get done, no matter what, so.
00:18:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So would you consider yourself a leader?
00:18:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
So I'm still figuring that out because I'm a really independent person. And like if I was able to, I would just handle all my cases by myself.
00:18:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what you do with is being a leader. What's that? What you do with Cynthia is being a leader.
00:18:36 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, it's still hard for me because like, like I work out a lot and I never have a gym partner.
00:18:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I always go by myself.
00:18:44 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. But she's been, yeah, I mean, I know what I have to do in order to get the team to, like I can be a leader, still figuring it out because like I said, a lot of things in life I would rather just do by myself, but. Obviously, can't 200 cases, when I need to, in college, we had a lot of leadership stuff. We're at like lead teams and trained people. I'm just trying to find how to do it, because obviously here it's like, if you don't perform, then your job is on the line. So I need to manage how I lead them, because eventually it's on me, right, if the team makes a mistake. So I need to kind of control and not be too harsh on them to the point where they're like, you know what, just go work somewhere else. So it's like a balance between, okay, we need to like fix this, but not talk to the team in a way to where it kind of ruins the dynamic because, you know, conversation, and they'll always remember that. Um, so that's kind of how many jobs have you had in your life?
00:20:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Real jobs or any job. Like I had a newspaper route when I was 11, I worked in the fields and dug two lip bowls out of the ground and my fingers were bleeding by the time I was like 10 o'clock and I was 11 years old.
00:20:23 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
So I was weird, but I worked, I cut grass, I babysat, I did like all of those jobs.
00:20:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And they all shape us. So tell me about your work history.
00:20:33 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I used to work at a grocery store before law school. And this is my second job.
00:20:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So how are you? How much time did you spend there?
00:20:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Three months?
00:20:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Three months? Yeah. So what did you do?
00:20:51 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Like did you play sports? Yeah, I played water polo and swam in high school.
00:20:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was a different. Swimmers are different I'm trying to I'm trying to profile you.
00:21:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, well, the biggest thing is like the gym like that's like my my baby so That taught me a lot of lessons.
00:21:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um Do you compete?
00:21:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I don't but People would think I would the way I treat it, you know Are you an only child? No, I have an older brother How much older two years?
00:21:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you're the baby Okay, yeah, just taking so do you feel like you've had much for opposition and life?
00:21:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Um Probably not But those are a lot of times those were because of the things that I did like Like I worked my up in school to Fast the bar on the first try for example I could have been an opposition if I failed and I got away another year to take it and things like that So I feel like I do the right things to minimize the amount of like hurdles because I don't like when things get postponed or I Don't know I'm just very that's why you don't like working with other people because most people don't show up like that, right? Um, I mean the team's been really good so far.
00:22:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't really know. Let's just talk about the team I just talk about you in general like all the way up through life because you do a lot of stuff by your own So it's definitely not just about your team and and treat law Why does it do you feel like like all you do you feel like you're I don't think you're an extrovert? But are you extroverted introverted or ambivert meaning a blend of both?
00:22:50 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
But it just depends what I'm doing like I Work I'm pretty pretty introverted and just come in do my thing and go home but then at the gym I'm looking
00:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
totally different person like. Yeah.
00:23:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
You know, or if like, there's something that I want to fix in my life, then I'm extra vertical because I'm like, I got to get this done or do you have to be around people all the time like to feel and there's okay, so you're an amber bird. I can literally work in a square box and not see a single person for a year and be okay. But I can also come here and like chitchat and have lunch with people like, you know, yeah, it's kind of weird. Like I can really do both.
00:23:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, that's that's good. You actually you have a lot of qualities I am very familiar with and they're all amazing. So I don't know that you know that about yourself yet, but you have the potential to do some really amazing things. And the great thing is you should try to stay humble, which I think you actively work on constantly. I think you're probably conscious of that. But there's a huge difference between confidence and arrogance. But the power of confidence is that you get some things done faster, but also it has energy and it's palpable and it moves people around you. And I think that you have it, but you may be resisting it in the vein of wanting to not be arrogant. Hold on, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm we'll keep our eyes up. I will finish my call and then no, not here and there. You know what, go ahead. She can come. Come on, you're filthy. All right, thank you. you okay now? Okay, so we had a massive flood in our yard. We had an above ground pool that just exploded in the morning and it sounded like worse than any tornado or anything I've ever heard. And so my daughter was out there and she she's 17 and she's going to clean it up and apparently it cleared a little hole in the corner of the fence where her dog could get out and she was terrified that she'd lose her baby and so she was like freaked out and I'm like okay anyway you never know what you're going to get no I've got four daughters and they're all super strong well they're two of them are grown 117, 114 and I have a granddaughter and It's the most wonderful, amazing thing in the world, and it is also the hardest I can imagine in the world. My mom used to always say, I hope you go and just like you. And I was like, well, I got four, so... Perhaps you four is something else. Yeah, and by myself, that's been something else. But like I said, it birthed. It birthed this, and I love what I do because I get to meet amazing people, and they're all leaders, and they're all brilliant, and yeah, yeah, pretty magical. I love what I do. So anyway, back to you, Pat. You prefer Pat. Yeah, not Patrick. I think they're way worse. In the way. Well, okay, so let me look at this time. just kind of think about this. So I don't know. this is... We didn't have a contract. Mark and I did make a contract for how long we'd work. with you, but he's paid for the quarter. So what I would love to do is just, so in the beginning with anyone, and then normally they're seeking me out, not this is somebody else's person that I work with. I do work with teams, but it's not the predominant thing that I do in way that I go about it. But since the quarter is paid for, the schedule that I suggested to Mark was I meet with you, once by yourself, you and Lorenz twice, although we may switch that up and just be do more one-on-one stuff because you will have very different goals. The benefit of meeting together is that it helps uncover some of the commonalities, some of the issues that might be not necessary issues, but what are the processes, what are the levers inside the business that we can do to improve? So like intake, for example, does not have a script that people follow consistently. And because of that, calls are handled differently. And we have figured out some better ways to handle calls, but because there's no script and the process, it kind of depends on whatever mood people are in, kind of mood the calls are in, and that's not the optimal way to run business. So, Mark's competitive too. Mark wants to see Sweet Lock Row, wants to get more cases, everybody wants to make more money, but not burning people out while doing it because life, you get one life, like business is not the thing. Life is the thing. So, figuring out how we can do all the things better and more powerfully in a more leveraged way so that, like I said, I love more from less. So, What I think, I would love to be able to spend time talking to you about just things like Cynthia, we talked about her a little bit. don't know anything about Elsie because she's newer also. And kind of figuring out how you guys work like what are some of the things that you come across. It's really a lot of just, it seems like we're just talking. It's very, it may even seem unstructured. promise you, it's not unstructured. I have been doing this actually for 22 years. So I've learned that there are certain types of conversations and it's primarily PAP. It's primarily probing. So I will ask a lot of questions and sometimes what you'll find out is that the questions made you think something you weren't thinking before. They make you ask your own questions or ask a question you haven't. Ask yourself before and by coming up with that answer, you're just like, Oh, well, I didn't think about that before. So now maybe I could try this. Maybe I could try that. The other benefit because we're doing this kind of as a group inside a sweet law is that as I'm talking to you and looking at things like go to Mark and be like, Hey, you know, Pat was having this experience. I didn't know about this. Can we try this? Can we try that? know, and I see that, but Mark, and I imagine you've figured this out, but Mark loves people. He loves his people. I don't know how he shows up in the office, but the way that he talks about people is, you know, this is like this is kind of his surrogate family. He, he cares like he's not, he cares about to take, like you talked about how you talk to people. He cares about that too. Although I think he's better at it now since talking. Can you me? I'm just going to take a little credit there. Just, you know, just work is work. We're all people trying to be the best people that we can be. And we do better when we can work with people who have some different experience, like you talking to Samantha. That's great that she's supportive and that she answers questions like that. And I think I remember Mark talking about you doing that from the very beginning, just asking lots of questions. Like that's actually also a great sign of a leader there. It might not seem like it because they're going to somebody else, but it is. So goals, that's what we were talking about. Okay, you want to compete with Samantha. Yeah, I like get some of the best case, not necessarily with her specifically, but as far as Sweet Lodge, just be one of the best attorneys. there, put up those big numbers, but also you care about the clients that come in, you want to take care of them. You've got these broad chill shoulders that can take some stress that other people can't take. You've noticed that you've got to be accountable for the work that happens on your team and so that you can't just leave them unchecked to work fully autonomously, but you did try to give them autonomy and but with direction and leadership. All of that is really, really impressive actually. There have to have to be diplomatic and when I say sometimes, so hold on a second. I won't say who and where but in some places, some people just don't care that even in tweet law, there's there's somebody that just those up for paycheck. That affects everybody, because they don't hold the same weight. And that could be in any department. I'm not naming names or anything. But my point is that even just one person like that impacts the energy of the firm, impacts the trajectory of the firm, and it takes a really long time to hire anybody. In the three years I've been working with Mark, I think we've hired maybe three attorneys, and he constantly has ads out looking to hire people. It's just really difficult to find good people in a good match. Not everybody wants to do pre-lit, right? know that. There's a lot of different things that people are looking for. when he's got somebody, he wants to take a care of them, train them, and make the most out of it for sweet love, but also for that person. And me, especially, I'm just mom wherever I go, which is not a professional way to really look at it, but it just is what it is. I was, I was born a mom, I was as a kid taking care of everybody and like, can I feed you? can I do for you? Um, so, so that's it. And I feel like you've got some mad potential actually, and it's really exciting because I've been watching sweet love grow. You know, I've, I've heard, um, some that Cynthia's had some struggles and to know that there might be, but also that she's great, that she's nice, you know, that she's a good person. So if there's somebody that can help her grow and, and be better and be able to be even more valuable, then that's amazing. And that makes you even a greater asset. So I would love to talk to you about just leaders. ship and optimization. different ways that like you've noticed, there are some things that have to be done. Like, so one of the things that I know sometimes calls just don't get followed up with consistently enough and the ball gets dropped there. And you know, if the cases age out too long, sometimes we've missed things. We're not we're not getting those. For the life of me, I can't tell you how many times I forget that word. And I know it. Yeah, no, when we don't when we don't get the backs. It's the benefits, but it's that's not the word. Yes, thank you. I swear there are some words in my brain that just are never want to come. Oh my gosh, and the most random ones and inappropriate ones. Sometimes we'll come and have the right ones. Anyway, policy lemons. Okay. Well, let me turn it back. Yeah, so not following up with things consistently and also like, again, on the intake side, not asking some of the right questions and then we find out that they've already talked to another firm or that they haven't gotten to a doctor and the case is too old, know, like there's all these different things that impact the likelihood of being able to do well and get our money because at the end of day, it's also a business like we're here to help people, but we got to help the team first by making sure we can stay in business and do good. So all of that. But I think that you and I talking together. Now, it's not a, wow, amazing. I can't believe this thing happened. You know, we don't have conversations like that. What happens is it's like working out like if you lift and you follow a regimen for years, sometimes some of them like you can, you can beef up fast. but some of them are like you just look six months later and you're like dang like I'm a little more cut and or I can I'm not tired anymore or these joints don't hurt anymore or like this this you're so young you probably don't know these things but yeah I'm injury free thing going you don't you don't know I'm 40 so I'm about to be 48 so like I know about these things I'm sorry um weightlifting is life for me I don't go a lot but it literally but I go consistently all the time and it's it's life like I'll never quit I'll be a hundred in a gym I don't care I'm like I'm not gonna have all that old dick crub and stuff happening anyway so um but I think that if we focused just on because I think that you're already you may not do you feel like you were interested in leadership like consciously
00:38:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I feel like naturally I'm just like better off as like the grunt like just have me do work and I'll crank it out. So not naturally like seeking out leadership roles, but I feel like here everybody has their own little team and it's cool that way because I get to manage it and it's not like I know a lot of firms. It's like case managers just bounce around like whoever needs to grab want to do this, but for me or here it's like your team is your team like they don't just go work for somebody else for a week and come back. So it's cool because I can obviously I need the help right so I'm going to do what I need to do to make sure that everyone here is like working good and they're happy and so it's cool in that regard to know like when we have like a really big mantra. whatever that, you know, the team did it. at the end of the day, if I'm managing them well, then those numbers mean that, you know, as a leader, you did the right thing. Which is cool because if I go out and go do something by myself, that's great. But if I was able to do it while managing four different people, obviously that takes a lot more work. So the reward is like, wow, he did this and was able to manage all these people. And it's like more responsibility. But it's cooler when, because I know like if I'm just by myself, I know what I can do, but I've never had to really manage people. So that's like the new test for me. Which is cool like when it works out. But you like it? Yeah. Now, if I have like five people then, I don't know. But before we got into the group and we're doing good. So I'm gonna have the smallest team because I don't know. The biggest case load, but like months where we beat the other teams is like cool, you know, because it's like the three of us or when it was just me and Cynthia's like the two of us were able to beat the team of five, you know, yeah, but things like that keep me competitive. Like, you know, the mitigation guy, but he only has like Nick, really love. Yeah, really a lot of cases and he was beating me for the attorney's fees this month, like Mark sent it like a couple days ago and like that pissed me off. I was like, what's Obviously, if you get like a big case, big numbers, but And that's the ones that go to litigation anyway, so Yeah, they're kind of predestined to be higher numbers anyway. Yeah, but still.
00:40:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll just tell you one thing, though, is Don't compete with people playing a game you don't want to play. You don't want to play a little game. You don't want to play litigation, so like, don't compete with people playing a game. You don't want to play. don't want to do that. It just, it gets in your head. You know what I mean? Gun from the people playing the same game as you. Because you just get tripped up. You take your eye off the ball and that becomes a problem. It creates this internal dissatisfaction that can't be corrected because you're not playing the same game. Do you know what I'm saying?
00:41:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:41:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I get that, but you're not playing the same game at all. You know that, right?
00:41:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, well, if Mark sees it that way, then I'm cool with it. But as far as I know, could ask him, you can ask him.
00:41:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know he's the numbers and it was last and that's all he was saying. litigation and everybody else is 100% completely different. And I know because I've been talking to him for three years. And we look at the numbers and we don't even talk about Nick and the litigation team. It pretty much is isolated and honestly That's my bad. We probably should talk about it more, but that's it's not because what what really? Mark see sweet lot as a pre-vit firm period and the story litigation is only there to serve a necessary You know thing. It's a need we have to have an outlet for it. There's money on the table We're gonna take it, but Nick is playing a different game that Mark's not even really interested in playing It's just part of it. You know, you know I'm saying. So I You know you could talk to him ask him out right because Mark I think is pretty open about stuff too And if he tries to evade the answer cuz he does do that sometimes pin him down and be like wait look I like for real tell me Um, you said we're not planning to say gay That way like put it on me. I don't care. I'll be scapegoated all day long. I'm built for it. So Yeah, so the question really was like, do you see yourself as a leader and what I see is that you're still evolving and defining how you see yourself. You really just getting started in the professional world. And, but I would tell you, Pat, 100% you've got innate natural leadership qualities. And you may not be seeking them out. That's, that doesn't mean that that's not what you are. A lot of leaders don't. There's different types and, and it has a lot to do with the extroverted introverted type of thing, right. But some of the best leaders in the world were there because everybody else said, look, we need that guy because first of all his ego is not going to trip us all up and get us in trouble. It's not going to send us to war like Mr. somebody with their orange hair, but you know diplomacy whatsoever. You know what I'm saying, like, so. So, there's different types of leadership, here's where it's just natural for you. see a problem, and you say, like, you see yourself as, I just the grunt, and I just want to knock it out, but that's leadership stuff. I see that there's work that has to be done. I'm going to do it. That's a leader. You know, even if you're only one person, you're a leader of one, I know you've seen enough people in life to know that there are people who won't even steward themselves and manage themselves, right?
00:44:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, percent.
00:44:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. and there's a lot of those, right? Yeah. So, you not only will take care of yourself, but you see that, okay, I've got this thing that I'm a steward over now, this little pod, this little group, and I was trying to give everybody space to let them do their own thing, because I like to do my own thing, but then I realized they're not doing it well, so I'm going to help them. I'm not going to browbeat them, and I'm not going to hurt their feelings. I'm just going to show them how they can be better so that we can be better. Dude, that's leaders all day long. That's like good leadership all day long. So I would like you to just kind of ponder on that. It doesn't mean you need to go seek out leadership opportunities. It doesn't mean that you need to see yourself any kind of different. But knowing that first of all, it helps the people that you do have stewardship over it. Like I said, there's an energy to it where, and I would bet you anything Cynthia already feels this and else you do. It's Elsie, not Elise, right? Yeah, Elsie. They just are like, Pat is doing his job. Pat is watching out for us. Pat is going to help. Because you have that calm energy, but it's also strong and it's also smart. And people, especially women. in work and probably in lots of places are going to feel safe there, but when you're also giving them the skills and empowering them, you're going to find out I'm telling you this because it'll be important. There's going to be a lot of ways that you can compete and you can win because you'll be able to activate people that other people won't be activated because they'll want to work for you. They'll want to do their best for you because they don't feel afraid and they know that they're supported.
00:46:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Does that make sense?
00:46:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And I could tell you I might be wrong, but I'm almost never wrong about this stuff and I only say almost just to be humble, but I'm never wrong about this stuff. So watch, but people will want to work with you throughout your life. know you don't know where you're going to be, how long you're going to be there, I really want you to hear this and take this with you because you'll see it showing up in your life that you can get a lot out of people because they feel safe with you and because they know you'll do the work. That's another thing like a lot of people are told what to do by people who have no food because they're not doing it. They've had terrible leaders, terrible bosses. When they get somebody who's in the trenches with them doing the work, who knows what they have to do and appreciate it, they'll show up at a whole new level. So talking about leadership, there are two books. you like reading and all or listening to audiobooks?
00:47:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I don't want to have you do things. I'm never really trying to read at least when I can.
00:47:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you like podcasts?
00:47:52 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
That's more tolerable, yeah. I think I've read maybe one full book in my life. Like as a kid, would be reading and I would just like read the same line over and over my mind would just be somewhere else.
00:48:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you didn't lost.
00:48:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I would like to go reading.
00:48:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you ADD?
00:48:17 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
No, I just don't sitting there flipping through pages.
00:48:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you don't listen to them either though. So it, um, do you, like, do you watch a lot of movies? Or you just like hit the gym a lot like, uh, I watch movies.
00:48:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, it was the same movie like over at all. I for sure don't have ADD. I just don't like, I just don't like to read.
00:48:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, now this is me asking because like I said, I'm trying to profile and understand because if I try to get you to do stuff that you don't like and don't want to do, then that's just not going to be good. So what I can do is just kind of distill some of those things that I think would be useful for you. Some people like to and they get a lot out of it. So my approach with you would be, let me go refresh my memory on some of the books and talk to you about a couple of things. But the principles of, so there were two books I would have recommended. One is called multipliers and one is called essentialism. And the thing about multipliers is just kind of basically something I think that you do innately and that is look for people's strengths and abilities and just help them tap into it, support what they have to do, and then give them the freedom to do it and what you described was doing that with Cynthia. So it would basically be the purpose of reading it would be to see maybe the other applications and also so that you had a greater awareness of the power of what you're doing, but it's not, it's not necessary to read it. And then essentialism is just, there's a lot that gets done, and this would be towards the processes and figuring out, you know, where is there anything that's happening that's being done that doesn't really need to be done, are things being prioritized so that the most important thing is getting done day-to-day to push a case to where it needs to go, right? Every day, there's lots of phone calls that have to be made, right? There's lots of contacts, there's lots of information that has to be gathered, whatnot. So making sure that the most important things get done first, that drive the needle forward, sometimes that's not what people do, sometimes they just take the low-hanging fruit, like this is the call that's in front of me right now, this is the case that's in front of me right now. instead of maybe triaging according to their value, their likelihood of getting close, how good at communicating the client is and you know there's all kinds of different ways to kind of evaluate what's the thing that should be done first at the beginning of the day and throughout the day and so on. So but if we have some conversations about that at minimum for the next three months because that's what's being taken care of and if we talk about you know what your goals are what I'll do is go and solidify to and make sure that I've got some numbers for you to take a look at and compare it to what you're looking at already and see if I've got any more information than you see how I can help you be like okay this is your trajectory this is what you're doing um across the board in terms of so there's attorney fees which is our really the staple number that we're looking at. But there's also how many cases, there's also how many cases get closed, like the pace that they're getting closed. And obviously, you guys can't control when it's resolved and you get paid out, but we can't how long it takes to get closed. So just looking at those numbers and giving you kind of one-on-one insight into that and a little bit of a different perspective, then let's say Mark would have, I think that it could be something that would be valuable for you.
00:52:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Are you interested in that at all? Yeah, because I mean, the numbers and stuff is like just puts it right there and you can see everything. So I like the numbers because it's just easier and I understand like what's lagging or what's doing good. Yeah. And it's like a motivator, like when I see the numbers, like, I like the numbers.
00:53:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have to, the only reason I'm not going to do it right now is because I have to ask Mark, you know, I'm able to share and look at, um, just got a new, uh, report also, which is the best one that we've had so far. So let me look at it. When did you start again?
00:53:30 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
November 1st, 2022.
00:53:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Holy cow, it's been not long already. Geez.
00:53:37 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. Well, the first year was just like a blur.
00:53:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so we'll, I don't want to do last year. do equals this year. That was free by team. Yeah. For the year, I still don't know what I'm allowed to say. So I absolutely. Okay, that cannot be right. That one has to be wrong. That's the other thing. As our report is, it's in progress. And so we got to validate it, make sure that it's pulling the correct data. Because like it's saying, Nick's team for the year is averaging 1.8,000. And we know that that's not right. For an average of chummy fee. So I will, it's definitely wrong. But you're up there for sure. are in the game. And for being so new, I think that's something. Let me look at cases closed. For the year. That's interesting. Yeah, I just want to make sure these thumbs right. So I'm going to see what I'm allowed. to share and I'll check with Mark because I think that what drives you I think seeing these numbers would be huge for you and I think watching the numbers change would be huge for you and then some of the other things I'd like to do is talk about L.C. and talk about Cynthia you know how they're doing any patterns you might be noticing good or bad like I definitely want to know about good and in terms of the bad like we're not here looking for how to fire people how to get rid of anybody anything like that we're 100 percent here for how do we make everybody better and feel safer enjoy what they're doing more sort of the clients better and just just improve everything so I think it's really important to because sometimes people come in whatever and their agenda is how do we weed things out that's not what we're here for at all. Yeah, so that's what I'd like to do is just have some conversations. And the other thing though, Patrick, is like I was saying is that what happens is I'll ask questions and they kind of reveal other questions and lead to the next questions. So what I would be interested to know is if you, I would love for you to just take a little time and think about the conversation we've had today and see if any thoughts just kind of pop up that maybe hadn't before or they had that maybe you hadn't done anything with them. And if you're willing to, like, I would imagine you're not really a journaler.
00:56:41 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Well, you want me to like think of a set of questions?
00:56:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, just kind of like, if you have a thought that you notice that was a result of this conversation, um, read it down and it doesn't have to be super in debt. That can be a bullet point, but it has to be written enough so that when we talk again, you'll remember and be like, wait, what was that about? Because I'm terrible. I'll write something down and be like, I can't even remember what I was thinking when I wrote down. So I just needed to be thorough enough that you could come back and go, yeah, I was thinking about this. Or like, if you're working and you're watching things going, you know what, I noticed this and I hadn't really noticed this before, because that's kind of all part of the evolution. But what that will also help me to do is know how your brain works, how what you're what you're kind of patterned are, because again, this is to be customized around you, like imagine, I don't know if you're like a Marvel dude at all. Which one? Marvel? Nope.
00:57:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
There's like a million characters.
00:57:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know. Well, if I say Marvel, most people might say, are you a Marvel person? They're like, yeah, yeah, but like, just anyway, imagine you're Tony Stark, and we're building an Ironman suit, but it's just for you. Like his suit was built. for his strengths and for his weaknesses and for his mission, like what he was trying to accomplish. He kept trying. He kept iterating his suits, right? He had new versions because he's like, well, this one didn't do this. So I needed to do that. So my process is basically trying to build your perfect Iron Man suit. Like you're already great. Tony Stark was already brilliant and amazing, right? He was pretty powerful just as it was. But with the suit, you know, that was like multiplied many times over. So the goal here is to be like, what's amazing about Pat? How do we amplify that? And so it comes through probing, learning experiences. So everything that you think about and everything that you just kind of notice and observe, bring that back to the drawing board with me and go, okay, I can work with that. Let's do this. Let's try this. type of thing. How's that sound?
00:58:57 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Good. I'm really open. I won't shy away from any questions. You have so pretty, like if you're asking something, I'll just tell you what it is.
00:59:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, my goal is to help you hit your goals. Yeah, it does, it does, it does. But the energy with it, like I want you to come with your competitive side. want you to come thinking, all right, we are gonna figure out how I smoke these balls. I'm like, we're gonna figure out how I beat this list is like we get, we get all the cases and we get the best attorney fees and everything else. Like, that's the goal. But while also being a good guy that doesn't hurt people, that's not like plowing through people just to get to where he's gonna go, that you're doing that, that your team's winning, that they're getting higher bonuses, know what I mean? That incentive program is good, you know, and there's a way to help everybody. Like you could be the guy that helps everybody get paid more. And I think that'd be awesome. So. So I want you to think about that like, okay, I've got kind of this silent partner over here is going to help me win even more, but it's not just you winning. It's your whole team winning and it's all a sweet while winning. So, you know, think about it like that. then read anything down that you have. And we'll figure out, we got to figure out a time next week. You already told me what can work for you. I'll see. I have not heard back from Miranda. So let me check with Mark. See if we can get something on the books for next week for two of us. And then, you know, it's really fluid in the beginning. It's kind of awkward in the beginning, but it gets some legs on it and we'll get we'll get a flow. All right.
01:00:47 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. So next week is not scheduled yet.
01:00:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, because I, it's supposed to be you, me and Lorenz. I haven't heard from him yet. So. Will yeah, I'll follow up with you on that.
01:01:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
That's okay. Yeah, I mean, any time works for me like Monday mornings. It's just like Class of a waiting all weekend to call and select a little bit push, but Afternoons are probably best Okay, we can do that.
01:01:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you told me like any day after like at three or later one or or three any day at three I think you said Yeah, I prefer not to be that late I like to be done with calls by like two o'clock, but Monday's different because I started 10 and then I've got back-to-back calls until 130 so like two or three on a Monday would be perfect three o'clock on a Monday is perfect Because I keep a lot of the other days up and just for the actual work and not the beatings But I do need to get with Lorenz, but for you and I we can make it Mondays at three When so the one one once a month that it's just you and me so far we can do that so like a month from now same time we can get that on the calendar and then if you have any questions if you have any thoughts and be like you just want to shoot it out before you're thinking about it I would love it in real time rather than waiting until we talk again because then my brain gets to start working on it because I keep a small roster and I'm thinking about everybody all the time it's just the way that I work like this is my little team and I'm thinking about like wonder how Pat's doing like checking his numbers like how's things going and so if any thoughts come up I would just love it if you just shoot an email and be like hey I was thinking this okay I can do any questions um no I'm actually excited for this people about my thoughts and stuff so this is
01:03:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
different, you know, but I'm open to it, you know, Mark mentioned to me that obviously there's a value there, so I'm always open to trying because I trust him and um what he thinks is worth it.
01:03:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's good to know. I'm really glad you shared that with me because like you're little stoic over there and just trying to read you and not give enough a lot with that poker face.
01:03:25 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
This isn't me though, like so maybe I'll, I don't know if I'll open up, we'll see. It's kind of natural, it just happens. Yeah, it does. But good thing is I listen to everything you say, so don't think like this guy's bored out of his mind, it's just like, I'd rather just like when it's time to listen, I'll listen when it's time to talk, I'll talk to the thing. So don't be put off by it, a lot of people are like, well it's better than showing the emotions, like I listen to everything he's saying, you know, so.
01:03:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will, I will learn that too in, in the way that you should. and the conversation. thank you. That was really helpful to me. So now I'm really, I was already looking forward to it. I think you're going to do amazing, but I want to serve you well. Like I, you know, that's what makes me happy. So I'm looking forward to it. I've got somebody knocking at my door. I know my daughter needs me. So I'm going to go and I will follow up with the pool. I know. Thank you, Pat.
01:04:24 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I hope you have an amazing day. You

Good to see you Hello.
00:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think I was. How are you?
00:00:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, how are you?
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am. I'm good. So much going on. I'm going to need to see if we can move this call, though, because we're getting into school time, and this is when the kids get in school right now. She's in theater camp, but it's the same thing.
00:00:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
She's getting around the same time. Yeah.
00:00:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there a time on Tuesdays that would work for you?
00:00:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Tuesdays. Yeah, we can do either Tuesday. Uh, or we can do it around like four here.
00:01:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, that it's the four PM ish, like the late afternoon. uh, can really move this thing around. I can probably do it too. Two. Um, well, this was the first one that you said one one. Yeah, I can make that work.
00:01:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:01:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, let me see. Let me just email Patrick real quick. This is you. I just don't want to forget to do this. So I need to take up our time with it, but, um, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, You Okay, let me get that off there. All right, so How's things been going since we spoke last week?
00:02:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Pretty good. I What started out, you know, was a pretty bad month Finished off as a pretty decent month You tree above $100,000 settlements. That was good. was, it felt good. The team was definitely a little bit down by, you know, two weeks ago. Everyone was a little bit exhausted trying to chase down some more settlements. Everyone was kind of stressed out and then the hard work paid off. So everyone felt pretty good about them.
00:03:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Job. How did they feel about the new incentive program?
00:03:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You mean the bonus structure? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think they like it. It's just, you know, we have to get the money in to make it money.
00:03:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
To qualify? Let me go open. And then if I see the report I want, I guess we'll do, oh yeah, Patrick said yes, all right, thank you guys, you guys are awesome. Well, that's going to be, I'm definitely going to need my brain on that one though, because I have to move multiple, and that's really easy for me to mess up, and I don't want you guys to get a billion emails up, oops, from one, sorry, oops. Oh, what am I going, oh yeah, let's apply. Me and browser taps, Lorenz. Alright, we're reaching to the choir. Equals, last month, because we are in August, refresh. Is that the one I want, I might want a different report. If you were going to go check your numbers, what would you do in Linify?
00:05:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I have no idea. I keep track of my own numbers on that spreadsheet. I don't particularly like Lidify. I find it pretty clunky. I can use it for what I needed to do. Anything that I want extra I just do for my own with Excel.
00:05:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, my god is a favorite. It's a case of science. That's not what I want. Probably do you want my dashboard?
00:05:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It means reports.
00:05:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out which one I want. So edit this one real quick. It's not going to be what I Let's see if this one grows last month. Because the reports, I don't want to have to go to multiple reports, so I want to go to one of my dashboards. So, cases, attorney fees, actually, so, your, that's my state, don't want to buy a state, don't want buy team. Cases close my team, I want to add, okay, gross fee by team, that can't be right.
00:06:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I also don't know how often I guess those reports get updated.
00:06:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One other good update as soon as I run it, if I hit refresh, which I did. You didn't just get 92,000 and then attorney fees last month, right?
00:07:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, yeah, it was the attorney fees was pretty bad.
00:07:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I think that can't be right either. So drop out subouts. What's other? I have dropped outside the data is two and then other is 30. Oh, 30 of 32 for two minutes. Hmm. Now we choose to. Let me go back to Mark's notes. So $1 million in and settlements $3 million, okay. So I just look at team brands, well I'm just going to click on you that should do it. Let me show my screen so I'll be looking at the same thing. Sure. Okay, okay. I'm to zoom out of my way here. I'll probably shrink this up a little bit so I can see. Oh, what am I looking at? Time period. It's probably for a month filter last month. I want to look at. Last time through. No. I'm not going to. I'm Save and run. Where's there an error? Filter, the friends. Get rid of that. I already have that. Save and run. That won't give it to me, that's not going to do it. I'll do it for this year. It equals this year. Refresh. It doesn't matter if it's my It's gross to turn me face by team. Okay, now we have just you. Which is not, oh, I think I messed up the report. That's okay, I think I fix it. Ummm. It must just be this, nope, I already clicked on a map to get one of them. I'm just going to discard that and go to a different report, see if this will work. I want to see your stats month over month this year. That's what I'm looking for. Let me do that. me go to, let's see, I don't know what matters. I don't want to turn a fees. Turn a fees this month. a fee by attorney. Oh, it's a mark reports. probably can't see it. Oh, that's everybody. I just overlook you completely. I'll see you. Tyler, Samantha, Patrick, Hank. What's this? That's a time of program. All right. What do you, how do you track your numbers?
00:12:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Uh, with an Excel spreadsheet. Can I see what you've got? Sure. So this is how I track my settlements, my money in, I use, basically use Michelle's reports that are in Google Sheets, this is my settlements, I keep track of how many I get, keep track of the other settlements and I have not every month since last August, so I don't the name.
00:14:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't understand why they're, like, do each of those attorneys, attorneys, have they worked on that case?
00:14:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, no, The name is just for me. I don't keep track of the name of cases that the other attorneys settle. I just keep track of their numbers so that, you know, I can see where I stand.
00:14:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what are, what are the line items then for everyone?
00:14:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So this is right here. This is my own box.
00:14:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:14:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's like the cases I settled last month. This is right here.
00:14:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so then these are these are these numbers represent cases and settlement amounts. Also for them, just not named.
00:14:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I don't, I don't keep track of names for them.
00:14:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, that makes sense. was just. Okay. No labels, okay. So then the totals. And this is settlements, not attorney fees.
00:15:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
This is July settlements and attorney fees. I have the records.
00:15:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So before we get into that, can we just go ahead slowly go through June, go through each month real quick.
00:15:26 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Let me just take a peek at what you've got. So this was June. A lot of cases settled, but not a lot of big ones.
00:15:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And your target for settlements is three million a month, right?
00:15:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
For settlements. Three million, that's the firm goal.
00:15:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Brown goal. Okay. What is your, what is the pod goal?
00:15:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, I've been setting it up 600,000.
00:16:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
not have one for you guys like on a pod level?
00:16:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No. Well, he's never expressed a specific pod goal. When I first started, he said my your break even number is you need to make $110,000 in fees every month. But since then we've hired new people. So I'm sure it's higher than that.
00:16:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and if it's not, it's going to be. Okay, so July, can you share on me July one more time, please? Okay, and May. And April. Can I see Megan? Oh, wow. Okay, April and March. Okay, December. Do you know how to tabulate across worksheets?
00:17:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I've tried playing around with it and I can figure it out.
00:17:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Would you mind sharing this with me? We can work on it and do a tabulation real quick? I know I do that. So share it, Tina at ProfitDrivers Inc.com.
00:17:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
See you now.
00:17:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
At ProfitDrivers Inc. Okay. Send that and then I will open it in ScreenShare and then I'll create a completely new tab so it doesn't mess with anything. We just get that. Wait for it to come. wait where are you asking me to log in a Microsoft?
00:18:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Is that a Microsoft thing?
00:18:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay see if then should be able to do that because that is my Microsoft account. All right cool. It's in there, I'm going to you Windows on my way zoom. Okay, so we're going to create a new one here and we need this to So do we want tools? No, we don't want tools. want that. We just want average name So then we'll just do the same. We'll take these. I'm just actually going to do this for a minute Okay, so we're that big enough to see. Okay, and we're going to uh we actually don't need any of this oh my gosh can i pick the right thing please all right delete these rows and okay i don't want to delete them yet so i actually want this to be really rent and i want it to here i want it to be average and it's going to be of you that um i think you have to do comma oh let's see you Yeah, that should work, right? And then this comma, that comma, that. So you would just change this formula by adding the next sheet every month. And then that should work. So that's your average. And then we're going to drag these, drag this over seriously. So that's your average. Now we can. Oh, sorry. Hopefully I can delete that without messing with the formula. Let me check the numbers though first.
00:22:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
How does Hank's average $900,000?
00:22:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. now that's when you go double check everything. Did Hank even exist back here?
00:22:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No.
00:22:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was marks that used to be marked. That's fine. Yeah. So we got it. That's the other things. We got to make sure it followed the same formula. So A, B, C, D, E, F would have to be the same across the board. Otherwise we just go and do them regularly. And so this is not correct because you will actually, it might be because I might have done it right. Hold on. So this is A, is B, B, B, B, B. Okay, so, so we can't drag this across. We just have to go do it manually. So you should be, yeah, we can't because of Mark, Nick, and Hank. They moved, and Robert even.
00:23:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, Robert.
00:23:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so you could do this, or if you want to spend time real quick, we could go do this manually. took like a whole minute, I think, for each row, then we'll have that data.
00:23:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Are you okay with that? Yeah, that's fine.
00:23:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'd like to see how I stack up. Yep. Okay, so we got to average, and then you go to the cell that you want. And so this is Tyler's. You want to make sure that we're getting that correct, and then we put a comma.
00:23:47 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, they make you the same format every time.
00:23:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So that would be the way to simplify this. If you wanted to create a new one next year or whatever, but this really doesn't take that long. to go through it. You just want to make sure that you're in the correct cell for the correct person to get the right thing. And then after you've chosen the cell, you enter a comma. Oops, there's a space. Don't mess up that syntax. And then put that word belongs and then go to the next one. And we're in Tyler. So Tyler and Samantha are that way.
00:24:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And then now they switch.
00:24:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Yeah. So now we're October and I need Tyler. And then November. Tyler is D. Comma December. Tyler is still D.V. Comma January. He's probably that way all the way through it. We're going to make sure Tyler. make sure I missed February here somehow.
00:24:52 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I don't have anywhere. You missed February.
00:24:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What am I doing? Okay. So April, Tyler, there, comma, May, Tyler, June, and July, May, June, July, and turn, and that should be Tyler. So, now we'll go to Samantha, and okay, so maybe it took two minutes, but still it's good.
00:25:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And that's because we're noticing some issues at the same time.
00:25:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
August is Samantha, I just want to make sure, because this looks a little bit, I guess it's just because it's so full on her line, oops, comma, Samantha, to go over to Samantha's Bee, November, I'm to go Samantha's Bee. Let's see, should I get my comp, okay, December, Sam, September, January, my ADD, and I really have to focus the comma, March, Sam. And there's no February, wait, yet January, March, Thank you, bye. I'm on a call. April, Samantha, we have April, so we're now going to May, comma, June, July. You ready for this? That's our average. Yep. And Patrick's and maybe do you want to get these guys yet?
00:27:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No.
00:27:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're concerned about Sam and Yeah. So now, now let's do a little bit of a difference. So let's get rid of this. And we're going to. Difference between. And. And. And then we'll do Tyler. Tyler. So it's going to be. I'm going to do this. I got to make it the same thing. So it's going to be. Equals. This minus this. And then equals this minus this. So that should be a negative number. This is how much more you are above Tyler on average and Tyler's been around longer than you hasn't he? Yeah. Yeah, Tyler's.
00:28:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, he's been around forever.
00:28:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He was minding her mouth for a minute. I don't do that very often, but I remembered I should. So, I mean, so I want to look at that as a percentage. What percentage of that? So, going to do this equals this. That can't be right. No, so it's it would be this divided by that. And I would just formulate it as a formula, no, not formula, uh, format, format, cool away, whoa, percentage. Yeah, we'll do that. Okay, and this equals that divided by that, and I'm gonna copy and paste special formula normally. So you're 132.6% out of the entire average over since August, so that's that's not quite as bad. She is, she is, she, she doesn't. Now kids, um, she's a workhorse and she is. Yeah. Yeah. Um, it's not a derogatory thing, but, but she's built differently. And that has to be taken to account.
00:30:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Uh, I mean, no, I, and, you know, I'm, I I'm, I'm supposed to be the nice guy, the, you know, the dad with kids, but I'm pretty competitive too. And I, I have been chasing her for the better part of the last year.
00:30:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to, let's, let's, sorry. I did not mean to cut you off. This is my brain.
00:30:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Please continue. Sometimes I get close, but, you know, it seems like she gets, uh, you know, well, you know, sometimes it feels like, you know, she settled, you know, one month, she settled like 30 cases. I'm like, you know, I was pretty happy with settling 23 cases that month. It's, it's just no matter what I do, it seems she's always like a step ahead, you know.
00:31:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, there's other things that we have to look at, but she, she just, I mean, she just, she's exceptional and, uh, but there are other values that get, oh, that's one time I'm on second. Hi. Amazon, her way to get to you. And she's, she's in cosplay, so, um, fun with that. And I'm going to call. That's why she can't to you. Oh, sorry. I just, I can't get it. No, you're, you know what the pollage is for coming up. just want to make sure that you know. I'll see you when you get home. Bye. She picked up from theater council. She'd be fine that she's like and she didn't know she was gonna go dress go pick her up What's our mental name? Miriam who I like that. That's a good good biblical name November Moses's sister Good Am I in December? I'm in December Patrick. See getting my brain back on track. It's a little bit of work Okay, January Patrick That's what I'm doing right December January. That's the right thing seriously March Patrick is coming That's quite a number isn't it? But I know he gets Mark's cases so Yeah Yeah, this is definitely not apples to apples June but it's still in the number so and pretty soon it's going to be more apples to apples June july okay so we do that wait minute what went wrong august september comma comma what did i do wrong here it looks correct oh it is correct okay we're not going to worry about nick is litigation right yeah i don't i don't compare that because that's just out of interest it's not how long this hink even had cases like it's a month and a half all right let's just go I didn't get him in there, so there's the formula. We're just going to not do these guys and they don't even need to be in there because of that. Hank, we're going to drive. Oh, here's my little. Hey, I dragged you. Oh, you're just slow. Okay. Average. And let's see. Hank was June and then comma and July. Okay, so we'll just go ahead and put him in here too. And that way we'll just watch that trajectory because you know you don't want them getting in front of you, right?
00:34:53 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, yeah. I've been watching him. I've been keeping track of him. I've been keeping track of the cases that. He's getting to, why is he getting the broken arm one?
00:35:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I mean, that's intake, really, isn't it?
00:35:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I think some of it is intake. I think some of it is also like, it's like a slam dunk. It doesn't make much business sense for Mark to like give it to me, and then I don't miss on it where I can give it to Hank, or who doesn't bonus, and then the fee can go straight to the firm instead of part of it going to my balance.
00:35:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But does Mark, I mean, he doesn't have that much to do with intake, does he? Unless they specifically ask him?
00:35:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, I think he does. I've talked to, a of it event, but who gets the cases as far as thought.
00:36:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was that before, so I want to ask and understand it again. I'm here to say, I'm here to say something. Yes, but that is something I've already been trying to dig into. So it's not necessarily motivated by the call. It's just this call. It's just like reiterated. I really want to understand that. Okay. So then. I love though that you've been tracking your number. July, July, July was above your average.
00:36:36 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, but not money in. So yeah, it was a good month.
00:36:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm going to get a good August as far as fees. Yeah. So let's do that now. What's, let's, I'll stop sharing and you could share your attorney fees with me.
00:36:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, attorney fees, I don't, so I keep track of it through Michelle's reports. So that'll be.
00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But are those not just monthly or something?
00:37:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, it's my. Commission reports. Share this with you. Are you. Share. You see that? Yeah. So this is, it's all dated down here. I don't know. All the fees for this year.
00:37:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, oh, that's going to be a lot of numbers to look at, balanced, cover based balance, do balance, do a sweet lot. Can you break this down for me a little bit?
00:38:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, so really what you're looking at is firm fees right here. That's the money I bring in. This is my commission's right here. And then, so really this is the number that matters as far as like what I think we're talking about.
00:38:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's just for a two week period?
00:38:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, this is, yeah, two week period at the time.
00:38:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. do you have, do So, attorney fees target is what, and is it by Sweet Law or POD?
00:39:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's by Sweet Law.
00:39:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and what is that across the board monthly?
00:39:13 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
1 million, I believe.
00:39:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, that's the 1 million, and then the settlements are 3 million, right, across the firm?
00:39:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:39:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, do you only see your report?
00:39:26 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I can only see my report. I mean, Mark posts them on the week before the end of the month, but he hasn't done it on the last day of the month in a long time, so we don't really know who wins.
00:39:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I don't know if this is correct. So, let me go look at something really quick, dashboards. That's average, I want to total gross attorney fee by team. Let see manners, manners by owner and status active manners by, I don't miss that we want active principal attorneys to kind of figure out which report. Or look at me attorney fees. Let see if that will turn the fees this month. I should be able to customize that by... So, Mark does show you everybody's stuff is just not at the end of the month, right? Yeah, so it's not up to date. Okay, so then I'm going to take that as the sign that it's okay to look at everybody's fees.
00:41:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:41:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you see it, you just don't see. It's just the timing thing. Yeah. So it's not a privacy thing. Okay, so, oops, I almost ended the meeting. Share. I'm going to take over sharing.
00:41:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I'll stop sharing.
00:42:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's okay. I'll share... Get these out of my way again. Oh my gosh. Grab the window. That's not the right thing. Okay. So this is for... This says... yeah, I don't want to change this for... It should be last month. This hot-time custom. Last month. Oh, run. Yeah, save it. That's good. Okay, so the runs... that's not right. Wait, so that's not right. That's right. That's what I'm looking for, that's empty. So that's not right. All right.
00:43:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
that's what I don't like about that if I never does what you think it you want it to do. Yeah.
00:43:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so that's what I need a note to solve. Okay. Let me go back to my notes here. All right, so we talked about scheduling recurring one-on-one meetings for your people.
00:44:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, they're coming up again.
00:44:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And they're monthly, right? So did you just tell them, hey, this is going to be monthly.
00:44:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
This is going to happen every single month now? Yeah, so then it's going to happen every single month. If we need to reschedule, we're it right away kind of thing. It's not like push it out to the next month. And I think we, yeah, that's what we had discussed regarding those. And then also set goals with them. And then set goals with them, follow up with each goal. I take notes of their goals and try to follow up with these goals.
00:44:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So did you create like a call agenda for those things so that you have something just to go through line item by one?
00:45:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I have this. I don't know if that's but it's the same format for everybody. It's not like kind of taking notes as they you know ramble on this. It's a bunch about the same format but I I need to digitize it maybe set it to them in advance too so that they can prepare for the meeting so they're not just like uh uh uh.
00:45:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah I think that that would be best because it helps mentally for that exact reason right? It helps kind of anchor them to what the purpose of the meeting is and you'll probably have a more effective meeting if everybody has the agenda even the agenda is the same thing every time, know, out of sight, out of mind kind of thing. Once you get there, now it's on your mind. But you really want them to be thinking about it ahead of time. So they're not searching for the answers. They've been thinking about it, formulating it, putting into the most articulate way so that you can really comprehend what they're trying to express. And maybe just even so they are able to find the words because sometimes you can have a thought and it's kind of ambiguous in your head. know, not really clear, a little fuzzy. So in just a reminder, and maybe it could be something that you automatically schedule. So let's say it's a calendar invite on Outlook and you have a specific invite that goes out to Viri and inside of the invite, here's the notes, here's the agenda because it's the same every time. And just a reminder in the calendar invite. I think in Outlook you can probably as well, how the reminders go out like in Google, can say day before, hour before, whatever, and have multiple ones. So the reminder would show up and it would show the agenda and just reminder, please review the agenda, be thinking about these questions in advance, and then when you get to the call, ask them, did you review the agenda, did you think about these questions in advance? Yeah, because you want them to be doing their part to make sure that the call is and their meeting is as effective as possible. And that is not a second thought, but it is the priority or an afterthought, that's the word I meant. Okay. So, can you read me your agenda?
00:48:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. I write down everything and so I end up with like no books.
00:48:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which is another reason to digitize it with a really clear title so you can find it. Yeah. Because I'm the same way and I've learned that the more those grow, the less helpful they are.
00:48:41 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yep. Yep. And I don't throw them away either. So, I just, yeah. So, first we start with, you know, basically, how are you doing? Well being kind of questions like how you do feel overwhelmed. Do you have any major issues, any stress points right now that we can address? And then we go through the basically stress points from the client's end and then stress points from the firm end to see if there's anything there that we can help relieve. So, for example, Jessica had from the client end, she said, like, forty percent of her time is being spent resolving PD issues for her Spanish speaking clients. And so we talked about maybe at the intake level, we can take a few extra minutes to kind of reset expectations with clients, explain to them where personal injury attorneys were, of course, going to You know, point in the right directions when it comes to PD stuff, but really our principal concern is their injuries and kind of reset expectations so that on Jessica's end she's not constantly resolving PD issues and On the firm and She says it's PD property damage property damage.
00:50:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry. Yeah, okay.
00:50:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Just make it sir Now the firm end Yeah, she had you know, we talked a little bit about how she's she gets really triggered and upset whenever Mark or Mary are stressed out about the numbers and stuff like that Does it feel sometimes like they're disappointed in us a lot, so She's Just gotta try to reassure her that you know mark is kind of like me We we kind of focus on what needs to be improved and Sometimes we forget to say good job, you know, we forget to Be encouraging that doesn't mean you think any less of first. Okay, I kind of reassured her there and then we moved on to the next The next section which is goals what go I asked her to give me goals for the next 30 days that she wants to accomplish and And, you know, Jessica's very like she's like, I want to do better at this and I want to do better at that Okay, but how are we gonna quantify that? How are you gonna measure that? She's like, well You know, I think overall just and I'm like, no, no, no, you need some numbers that can help you keep track of That and another question that you can ask is what does better look like? Yeah, yeah, and I did And I haven't done right here.
00:51:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What does better look like?
00:51:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So we said some goals about you know, collecting net, you know, cases that are stuck in collecting meds. And then we want to improve policy limit cases. So one of the big issues we have on our team is that Spanish speaking clients, they just want to get done right away. They don't, they don't care about case value, they don't care about treatment, they just want to be done right away. so we're having a hard time getting policy limits on them. And so we set a goal to get, you know, try to push for 10 policy limit cases in the next 30 days. And then one of the things we wanted was more face to face meetings with Mike or her co team member, feels like sometimes they can't redo the same work. So she wants to have, she wants to touch base with them.
00:52:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then at the end,
00:53:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Did you create a plan for that to happen or yeah, I spoke with Mike And then I spoke to the both of them setting that expectation My the issues I did not follow up like a week a week later to make sure it was happening.
00:53:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's my family so But we Did you set a timeline for? Okay, so they scheduled it to make sure it's happening. So you'll follow up on the next call and and that will be your follow up So at the very least it's gonna happen within a month. I think it's reasonable because you gave two adults a You're not micromanaging, right? You gave them an assignment They're accountable for it. So, you know, I think that that's I Don't think you dropped any kind of ball by not checking to me that would be micromanaging Did you grown people do what you said you were going to do? I'm following up, yes, following up a week later, whatever, no, you've already built this. That's the whole point of being very consistent about having these monthly meetings is, you know, unless it's urgent, if there's something urgent and it needs to be addressed because it's a major morale issue or a major financial issue, integrity, that type of thing, then you need to really step in because it's not getting handled and the cost is huge, right? The liability of not addressing it is a big deal. But if it's just overall day-to-day operations, the system following up with it monthly and then two things, one, empowering your team and two, setting very clear accountability. So, okay, you guys said you were going to get this started by next week at the late. It is. That needs to be what happens. And, you know, I'll be following up when we meet next to make sure that it happens. But when you do follow up, you know, you can, there's a couple ways to handle it. If it didn't get done. Um, neither one of them have an excuse. So Jessica asked for it. If Mike doesn't show up, but she doesn't say anything. That's on her. If Mike, um, up and it's not working well, whatever, then then that's just a talk about it, but if they showed up, then then it's good. So, and if Jessica didn't show up and Mike did, then he could say something, know what I mean? So there's no, there's really no reason to be more involved in it other than to say, okay, I hear you. Here's the plan. We're going to make it happen. Let me start the conversation between the two of you so that. that you know, as your reader, that I'm not asking you, I'm telling you, this needs to happen, make it happen, that kind of thing, but from here, your job is to make it happen, not, not mind. I'm not going to call you, did you talk to her, did you do this, did you have your meeting, this is the job, you said that you need this to do your job well, make it happen. If you have issues, report the issues. Otherwise, I assume it's getting done.
00:56:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:56:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, what else did she say?
00:56:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So then we moved to the third section, which I call coaching, any things that I have noticed that you can use a little bit of coaching on. And last month, one of the things I noticed is that well, number one, there's a lot of time spent on non bodily injury issues, like property damage, or just like, you know, listening to your client complain. about her life and things like that so she's you know maybe spending a little bit too too much time on empathy and there's a balance right because you don't want to get subbed out every month because you're too uh too short but at the same time you know I noticed that she was missing a lot of calls because the call that she had taken 45 minutes ago was still happening uh and so kind of thing yeah same thing as John you know uh you know we talking about last time so we talked a little bit about some uh being able to set down Teresa's client even if she has to say hey I'm so sorry I have to go into a meeting right now uh you know I can check in with you in a week to see if we can um if we can get this this thing resolved and then uh the other thing is case value we discussed case value and how we can better communicate with providers to make sure that even if the client doesn't want to do pain management, well maybe we can do a consultation and get an estimate, at least I guess it's more valuable on the case than just the chiropractor and MRI. If we have an estimate for a pain management dog, then there's future that needs to be considered. Even though state farm will likely not consider them, at least they have to, at least that gives us more of an argument. And then we set a date for the next meeting and that's it. That was my first monthly meeting, my first structured monthly meeting with them, so I kept it pretty simple, but if you have any suggestion of things that we can add to that.
00:58:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think it starts small, be consistent, measure the results of the start, and then you make improvements based off of what you've observed. It's entirely too, you can't think of the word, but so that is not the right word, but it's to want to go big and try to over plan and strategize and make the perfect thing, but the simplest solution is often the best solution. So trying to over plan and strategize how that should go, it is not good. Generally, it's going to stay very simple, very small, and the fine tuning comes from the content on the call with the person. What issues get revealed, what things tend to show up fairly consistently for a single person or across the board, and now what they because now we've got a pattern established, good or bad, so whatever the strengths are, you want to turn that up, right? And whatever the issues are, you want to turn that down. So it's more about creating a system for revelation of what do I not know, but what do my assets, my team know, and that's it. having our conversations, reviewing you go for calls with them and just kind of riffing off of what you learned, combine your experience with my experience, know, none of us are perfect at any of this, but, you know, two has better than one kind of thing, as long as it's a good head. mean, some people are just kind of, yeah, think Mark does a good job hiring people. for next. And it's interesting, too, because there's a variety of personalities and skills and ability, and that's one of my favorite things about it, though, is seeing the shifting across teams and how people show up differently on different teams.
01:01:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You know. I think that's why I learned a lot from you last year, is to kind of play to each team members' strength and not try to force them to a square pet into just a round hole.
01:01:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and not playing to their weaknesses per se, but figuring out what you can do sometimes to mitigate the weakness or, I mean, sometimes it's training, but sometimes the issue is personality and brain function, like some people's brains just don't work analytically or in the same kind of systematic way, and some cannot. deal with chaos like Cynthia, like it has to be structured or she's overwhelmed. And that's not a fault. She literally cannot choose to be a different way. So trying to compel her to be a different way, not only is it can't it's not going to be successful, but eventually that would just that could break a person. That's real depression. That's real anxiety.
01:02:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's real health. That's I couldn't see that. When she was on my team, I kind of could see that a little bit. She was just, you know, really getting frustrated with our style and our kind of, you know, like get it done as quickly as possible whenever you can and fit it in between function, like.
01:03:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the way people procedurally do things, those things are innate and they can't be trained. You can corral a little bit, but a small percentage, whereas if you can determine what their strengths are and amplify their strengths, it's pretty easy to amplify strengths when you realize what they are with somebody and give them the resources to do that and that also will increase autonomy. Then you now have an expert who can train some things to other people. There's a whole another way about being able to take advantage of that and not everybody can. There's also a threshold for emotional pain and stress that people can handle. Like Samantha, there's no comparison, I would imagine that Cynthia and Samantha probably could not get along well at all. That could break Samantha or Cynthia. I don't know, I'm guessing, but based off of what I know about certain personality types and performances, that looks like a disaster. Samantha is not wrong for being Samantha and the way that she runs. She's not bad for it. It's just how she, then there are people who can work really, really well in that environment. But Cynthia is not wrong for how she is. She's just Cynthia. So, but we've got people who are willing to show up every day, who are willing to tell the truth and be honest, be an integrity, who care about their jobs. Those things you can't train either. They are either there or they're not. And as large as this world is, there is a shortage of those type of people who will just rather than feel entitled to a paycheck simply because they were given a job. that is a really small percentage of people and that's decreasing. So when we've got people who are willing to work, who are teachable, at least willing to be taught, there's always the mental capacity of how much somebody can be taught. Interestingly, the only person, I've only ever fired two people in my life out of hundreds for being completely unteachable on a mental, intellectual level. One of them's name was Cynthia. She was so sweet and I hated firing her, but I had to fire her because there was nothing I could do to get through to her within the capacity that I was allowed to within the corporation. But that is almost always not ever the thing. What I usually end up having to terminate somebody for is bad attitude, unwillingness to follow procedures, unwind. willingness, not inability, but unwillingness to follow procedures, the way that they treat the customers, not showing up on time, not being reliable. It was almost never a training issue, because if I could figure out what their strengths were, I could figure out how to use them well. And some everybody's got strengths. But if they don't have the foundations of showing up being an integrity, being truthful, being dependable, playing as nicely as they can with others, at least being respectful. Samantha, I think, is super aggressive, but I don't think she's disrespectful. So some people just can't handle aggressive. I'm aggressive. I've learned to tone it down, because I don't want to narrow my pool of people that I can work with. And I've been offensive unintentionally, many, many, many times, sometimes intentionally. Yes, it's the Portuguese in me, but, um, but there's also African and Filipino and all kinds of other angry people. So, wait, I'm not saying that I agree with you. Uh, yeah. Anyway, so, okay, so having these consistent meetings, having a consistent, um, what you call it? Agenda and feedback. Let me go back to your notes. I like, um, hopefully you like that we went through and got the averages so now that you can. Yeah, I think averages is much better because it allows you to compete with yourself. Um, on a more realistic level. So there's two things that you can do. First of all, month to month, did you beat your average and also are you increasing your average because that's really what you want to see. Month to month is difficult because there's just a lot of play in the cases that you get. Yeah. And I like that you're keeping an eye on everybody else. And when you look at the averages, That's the great thing about averages is they it doesn't matter how long somebody has been there. It does because they're not given full case loads. And so you're still not doing apples and until they get full loads, right? But you're able to watch their trajectory and see how they're doing. And if you see somebody new pulling out ahead of you, maybe go like, all right, what are you doing that I'm not doing? What can I learn from you? And tapping into that knowledge base. But also you should be looking for what are you doing good? What's good about you? What are you improving on? Like really, you have to run your own race. Lorenz, because you're too, we are all too unique. We want to be inspired by our teammates, but it shouldn't be about self-deprecating.
01:08:55 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, you know, and I struggle with that because, you know, of my thoughts and school graduated, you know, with Honors in college and, you know, got, you know, always was like at the very top. And I've been sitting in second place to Sam for a year right now. You that's bugging me.
01:09:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, you can look at some things and we can try to break it down what you think it is, but a lot of it is probably going to be how she talks and how she communicates. And so you have to ask yourself what you value most. Do you value most being the top performer in the firm financially? Or do you value being an excellent performer in the firm and being a nice guy that makes people feel good? I'm not saying she doesn't because I don't know that makes your team feel safe. all of these values matter. So you need to decide what your most important values are and you need to rank them. When you evaluate yourself, you need to ask yourself, how did I show up on this value? How did I show up on this one? How did I show up on this one? And then month over month, did I improve on this value? Or did I at least hold steady? And then do that with all the things that matter most to you as a financial success in the company, but also in the way that you show up to your team as a leader, the way that you show up to clients. You need to measure all of the things because you're at the end of the day. First of all, we all have, we slow down, we get older, we slow down a little bit, cognitive function. There's a whole lot of things that go into play there. Having kids is a lot. It's a very difficult job. It is the best job in the world, but you can't always check that stuff at the door. Sometimes you can lose sleep over it. Sometimes what your kids are going through is popping up in your head. You're also married so whatever is going on with your wife You know and the older we get the more health issues come up and even though they're minor But all of these things like there's an accumulation That happens the older we get we care about more people We are involved with more people they take up mental space All of these things have to get taken into account and almost nobody does they're not Does not know that No, nobody does really I I'm just wondering because it seems sometimes like You know, I I want to have those values those non quantifiable values these talk about sometimes it feels like The only values that really matter at the end are the quantifiable the The You need to go have a great conversation then Lorenz and you need to say, I want to know these things. I want to know what matters. First of all, do I need to worry about losing my job and at what point would I need to worry about losing my job? And then you need to ask them what do you value and can you rank what those values are for me so that I understand it and how do you feel I show up in those values and ask them. I would like to know about the financial one. I know what those values are but I want to know are you happy with me? Are you happy with my pace? Like I know you think I can do better because I hear that all the time but what I want to know is what do you value about me and do you feel that my value is enough that if I keep going the way that I am and I'm trying to do the best I can do I need to worry about my job. If that's a concern that you have which seems that you do. Enough comes up. that I come from there's some like professional trauma that comes into it to where I know I've worked in places that you know if you have kids you're always kind of on the shopping block at then you're you're on the and no one says it but I can promise you that that's not what you have with Mark okay I promise you that I would not make a statement I wasn't confident in and it's the opposite he is very tender hearted towards families and kids and has a huge responsibility in taking care of his people as much as possible sweet lot is about the people to him I understand yeah I think that's why I'm very cautious in you know doubting him because honestly he
01:14:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
has given me no reason to to doubt him if I'm very if I'm being objective. And all of myself down actually come from my past experiences at other firms.
01:14:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good to know. But you know what it markers the kind of person I think you can have that conversation with and you can blame it on me. I'm just like I'm just talking to Tina and these things are coming out and I'm realizing I've got these fears and I think they're holding me back and like like you can tell them you want to do the best that you can you can tell them what you think your weaknesses are and what you're working on you can tell them that you think your teammates some call control training which I just googled and I think that we could probably find some training even if it's through video courses. My first life was in the corporate world and a call center and tech support and when you get old people who don't know how to use a computer now this was 28 years ago so computers back then nobody plenty of friends. Everybody would be like, they thought that CD holder was a coffee cup holder. I'm not kidding you. They would say their computer doesn't work. It's not even plugged in. I'm not kidding you. That was a regular thing. So, and they were lonely and they're like, there's somebody I can talk to. No, you can't because I've got, I've got metrics I have to meet or we don't get paid. So, but if I treat you badly, then I get docked and then we lose our business because they're also measuring that. So, I had to figure out where the safe place was where I could get them out the door, they're happy about it even though they didn't get the socializing they wanted and they didn't like being told what to do, especially by a little girl, especially the men. Didn't all like that at all. It was just, you know, almost 30 years ago. So, a lot has changed since then, but that was a whole different world. Anyway, your team call control for sure could learn that. I think everybody at Sweet Law intake, especially, needs call control skills. I've been talking about this with Mark. I really just need to go find the solution for him and get people on there and training, because I think that I haven't even listened to the calls. But from what I've heard, it's got to be there's way too much allowed to happen. And there is a way to finesse a conversation so that it's handled efficiently without hurting feelings. And it still feels like care. that is a skill, and it is trainable. Everybody won't learn it as well. Anyway, so, Pondre, think about it. But if you're not sure who you're working for, I would recommend that you figure that out.
01:16:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I think I'm getting an idea. Honestly, I share those, I share this with you kind of in confidence, but also because that's You know, that's some of the feedback I'm getting from the CMs that have been here a little longer kind of, you know, they kind of get the same feeling like that, you know, they like Mark and they feel like, you know, the firms are whole values then but they It's so inscrutable sometimes, it's hard to say, it's hard to see if he thinks he's doing good job or not. And you know, I think, you know, I will have that conversation with them probably later this month.
01:17:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll give you one more perspective. He pays me $1,000 an hour to have these conversations with you and I have no oversight whatsoever.
01:17:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, wow. Do you know anybody else that would be up for you? What's that? We should probably end this call soon we're over.
01:17:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I, it's not hourly. It's monthly. This is, this is my time. So it's me.
01:17:59 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Honestly, that that did. a lot of my confidence when we set up these calls because I know how much he values you and so if I was I know that if I was on the shopping block he wouldn't bother.
01:18:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No 100% would not because there are other people that not really on the shopping block but he would not invest in. So that's also between us. Um but do you know anybody else have you ever worked with anybody else that would give you that kind of training and that kind of time?
01:18:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No.
01:18:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I understand that it's what you hear is get this stuff done. But um I don't know if you were listening.
01:18:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
By the way sorry for interrupting but I don't kind of the same one of the issues that I'm kind of the same as Mark is I also think about what's next. I never take the time to smell the roses.
01:19:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you really care about your people, don't you? Yeah. And you're not looking for ways to fire than you're looking for, how do I help them, right?
01:19:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Exactly, yeah.
01:19:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. I think that you two are, you have some similarities. There's a scripture though that says, shall know them by their fruits. How many people do you see getting fired at Sweet Law?
01:19:25 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I think I've seen in two years, I've seen one. And I've seen people leave, but getting straight up fired in one thing, because she never showed up, essentially.
01:19:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's probably pretty unique, isn't it? Yeah. How many people do you see getting suspended, terminated, like, fully berated in front of everybody? I've never seen her. And how many times have you heard somebody like complain is just about getting. two down getting threatened with our job and just high levels of stress over it. Let me just give you one more example. Cynthia is still there. I know Mark has a hard time with her too, but he still keeps her and she's easier to replace than than an attorney. So I don't tell you a lot right now. When I say you shall know them by their fruits, you can say all that you want to do and you can look like a prickly pear, but if you're soft on the inside, you know, that's what kind of fruit that we have is that at the end of the day, the people are really what matter most. The business has to be profitable for the sake of the people. What good is it to you? Sweet Law isn't profitable. You don't have a job anymore. So he has to push that. But but also tell you one more thing and then I do need to wrap up is that when we start reported this. It was supposed to be every other week. And it was mostly about marketing business building. And it was with, it was my client that Mark also works with. They were working together and he says, I need Tina in here because she does something I don't want to do, I don't do, but I need you to have her helping you. And so we got on a call and then the second week, Mark said, how do I get this weekly and how do I focus on leadership? I've never had anybody before that say, I need to work on my leadership. Now we did that, but nobody just asked and they didn't ask right out of the gate because I had asked him some questions and he and his self reflection was like, I need to be a better leader. And so he's been working on it. So I will tell you, you have a very unique person that you're working with. And if you do better because you just want to do better and make them happy but not because they're scared. That energy is different. How we operate from fear is very different than how we operate from confidence, even if we have the same exact goal. So ponder that a little bit and maybe get to know what we work for.
01:22:13 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's funny because I just said that's my 11 year old last night. It was just that conversation.
01:22:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And this is why we all need people that we can talk to you because we know the things but sometimes we feel to recognize where we're not employing.
01:22:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's me.
01:22:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's me. It's all of us, really. It's all of us. We have to have those people. So but when you're at the top in your area and there's really not a lot of oversight from Mark. So really you're top dog and there's not a lot of people to counsel with but also you know don't necessarily want to tell your boss everything that you're worried about, especially with previous trauma. In the standard corporate world, that's just not that's just not good for business. It's not a safe thing to do. But what I'm expressing to you is that you do have a very different situation. situation here, and I would suggest that you explore it, and then ask for advice, use mark, but I think if we keep having these conversations, just inspecting how you're doing things and making these little changes, the amazing compounding effect over time you look back and you go, wow, we're all different. And it's just because we're inspecting it honestly and bull normally every week and then making some decisions based off of that and it's pretty powerful.
01:23:35 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I appreciate you showing up and, you know, not being like, oh, Lorenz, you know, you're just too nice of a guy or he's not getting it or, you know, I appreciate you. I know I take some repetition, you know, I know I can be a little stubborn in my ways because I'm probably a lot better than you think you are.
01:23:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I promise you, it does mean no good to tell people things like that and to lie. I get nothing. out of it except for more work. If I were to compliment you falsely, I'd just mean my job harder. You're better than you think you are. Whatever that past trauma is, whether it's in the workplace or anywhere else, I know. But generally the best people are the ones that are the hardest on themselves and it's usually the jerks that think that they're the most amazing people in the world. It's so weird, but that's the truth. So the reason you can see your flaws so much is because you're looking for them and because you're trying to improve them, whereas an egomaniac and an narcissist is not looking for their flaws, they're looking for how awesome they are and they're working on nothing. So take that into account too. There's a balance for everything, but what I want you to make sure that you're doing every day is, what did I do good today? What was good? What did I move forward or what did I do even though it was hard? What did I do to Help somebody else be better. What did I hold myself back from when I just really want to You know take into account all the things that you did good if it was it was You know spouse related if it was parenting related if it was health related because we can't do all things all the time So you have to take all the things into account Because what you might do is go. Yeah, I dropped a ball at work hard for today But if you had a super dad day, I don't really care what you did at work that day I really don't because it all comes out in the wash But Lorenz is the one at the center of it. You're the nucleus of that world and so you have to count all the winds and You can't just go. I did all these things wrong. I'm not saying don't take stock of the things that should have been better I'm just saying count all the good things every day You'll start to feel better about yourself and not in an egotistical way You'll just recognize your power and you'll be able to let your weakness says have less power over you recognize that they're just human and tomorrow will be a little bit less weak and a little bit more strong.
01:26:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, I think that's good advice. think that's what I've been working on this year is trying to be lose my confidence less easily when something bad happens when trying to.
01:26:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so this is, I know you're saying it's the last thing, but this is where your tracking is going to help you. Okay, so looking at all of your stats and having them in a spreadsheet where you can look at your monthly's, but then your average is, and you're just looking for incremental improvements. So when you go have a bad month, you go back and look at your average and go, but it only knocks my average down a little bit. So maybe the disparity between the two months are super huge. The average is going to come out and so you're going to go, you know what, bad month, shake it off, month we're on fire because we're due for it.
01:26:55 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's how it's going to work. I see. Now that's good. I'm glad you. but the formula's in there. going keep them going for the, you know, every month now.
01:27:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so and that we want to track attorney fees too. So I'm going to see if there's an easy way to do that through the reporting and if not, we're going to create a spreadsheet and take Michelle's stuff and just start tracking that and whatever reports Mark gives you and we'll make our own spreadsheet and tracker because that is actually going to help you too because you'll keep it in a track of that anyways and that's good. All right, well you have a great amazing week and I will talk to you

Hi, Tina.
00:00:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi. How are you?
00:00:03 - Laura L
Oh, good yourself.
00:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. Good. Let me, I was just opening Trello. Well, I've not done nothing, but I'm so glad that we're doing these calls because right now, this feels like really the only traction. But the fact that it's here every week is really good for me for getting started with traction. And we'll definitely get more as we get into school time when my girls are back in school and summertime, playtime and just soaking up the sunshine time is over.
00:00:39 - Laura L
Yeah, no problem.
00:00:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I did, I did work out something with a friend of mine that I'm going to hire who's going to, because my issue I told you before is just sitting down and focusing and getting things done. And so she's just going to come in and sit with me and hold me accountable. Well, I do it and I'm hiring her for that. So. Hopefully that will be helpful. Yeah, so let's just I will screen share and we'll go through Trello together and just have little conversation and then also if you have any questions about the stuff that you're working on and want to make any progress on that we can save some time for you because our stuff isn't going to take that long.
00:01:26 - Laura L
Yeah, right now I don't have much progress yet because I'm actually sorry just to see elementers to explore elementers but I haven't really I mean didn't have the chance to look at the cubic yet because I don't have the login. Oh, like it went to the wrong side.
00:01:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Alright, okay, so this is actually what it should be so let me edit. it. That is so weird.
00:02:00 - Laura L
Look at that. Yeah, I tried to type in that link, but it would ask me to enter the code.
00:02:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's so weird. Okay, let's see what we can do now.
00:02:15 - Laura L
Okay, let's go ahead and try to log in. I'm going to turn the brush. Mm-hmm. So it's still the same URL. Maybe it takes a while to update it.
00:02:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, um, well, I mean, I wonder what would happen if I just drop a link for you in the chats. Chit-chur, Chit-chur.
00:03:17 - Laura L
Chit-chur. Yeah, it asks for the verification code.
00:03:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is so weird because it doesn't do that for me. don't remember it ever.
00:03:44 - Laura L
What the heck?
00:03:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okie dokie. Well, let's just go check. I'll show you. I don't have to factor authentication even enabled. So... So, your code is 617 808, again, okay, works, 617 then, yep, 808, yeah, I'm in. Sweet, okay, then I will get in and then around. So, do you have your browser settings to, like, clear cache regularly or anything like that?
00:04:32 - Laura L
No, I have to manually do it. Yeah, I am going to.
00:04:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, that's not going to be an issue. So, this is all a few years still, but I can't add the one too. Everything's fine. Okay, let's see. So, let's see settings should be under there. Oh, code it now. I'm trying to think where I saw 2FA, maybe it's a count, it should be count management. Well, I'm just going to have an upgrade. I'm going to stop sharing for sec. Okay, we'll do this. what, what, what, what's one of my doing? Basic, I don't want basic actually. I mean, I guess we could start with... Hold on second. Think of it. Like, uh, planes, press N on it. I'm the planning a little for you, do, do, do, do, one of courses, administrator. I'm pretty sure that was the one that I needed, which is $100 a month, because I'm not paying it annually. I did, I don't need that, so that's just more like expand and not different features, okay. So, let me go back here real quick, um, upgrade now, subscription plans, that's what I want to click on, because that will give me options, okay, there we go, wait a minute, oh yeah, okay. That's cool. I'll start. I'm afraid. See that works. Okay, we'll go back to screen share, let's see the right window, share, okay, let's go to account management. If you have an issue with it, you can ping me on Slack or Upwork and I'll just get a code for you if you need to get in with it. Okay, and just forward it to you, so don't let that stop you. I do want to change the domain.
00:08:31 - Laura L
Maybe I could go to like in the setting and add in like a code generator, so.
00:08:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, like a Chrome extension? Yeah, that would be good, we could try to figure that out. What was I doing? thought I was setting some other settings, part of of it is just going to be learning to navigate like where everything's at. your site name appears in the title, except just how do I change that? Okay, Add custom URL, sorry, must be, okay, and we will also, wait, so is a full domain or just, oh yeah, you could it in it. There we go, that's what I wanted. Okay, you know it's okay, we didn't use it. All right, cool. So then when you log in, we'll just change this edit item. Okay, so you're going to look into Elementor, but I got, what did I call it, okay, no, that's not, and I shared a login with you, you should have that, yep, okay, so I don't know, like I wonder if to use it. I don't know how great it is as landing page builder, but that is, let's see. So this is why I got it, a funnel builder optimized checkout pages. So the sales pages really need to be fast and they need to be eye-catching and I mean, we might be able to do that here, don't know, funnels, automation, oh, Elementor, what it is. Okay, perfect, okay, so we, okay, can connect this, okay, so this is going to be your job. So we gave you the example of James Wedmore on his homepage and we're not really like trying to model after him, but looking at some of the core elements. So it's clean, so I don't have any as featured on kind of thing, we don't have this, but sections like this where I can put types of content intentionally and about section, I do have testimonials, I do have podcast episodes. Okay, so part of it is that there are, it's parallax, well I don't know that this is really parallax, but it's the big chunks of content and it's obviously responsive, very responsive, so that's good, so I don't want anything that's not fully responsive on any device because that will lose people. And then it was the movement, the animation. like just a reminder that popped out, this slid over. That popped, you know, that slid. Pop slide, pop slide, pop slide basically. So if we can get those features on a simple page on Elementor, that's it. Otherwise it's very clean. rest of it is the power of the images. These are really great images. Yeah, anyway. So we could spend time if you wanted looking into that together, but really that's the assignment is picking our stack. So for checking out, it'll be PayPal or Stripe. And then we're building on Thinkific. And there is already, you know, I don't remember communities, like community, trying remember what the draft was like. So I would want to have two communities, and one is free, okay, and one is paid, that's it just too, because any more than that, and it's problematic. And I will probably hire a community manager to help out with that. So two communities, one free, one paid. They should really look pretty much identical other than the background or whatever, so similar branding, but just showing there's this one paid, this one's higher level, whatever. And then for the products, Let's go back to the settings and try to remember, because they had that AI that's like, hey, tell us about product, community's digital download courses, that's what it was, right? accelerate your course creation with AI. don't remember that one being there before, was it there?
00:15:31 - Laura L
I think it's not with the 3-1.
00:15:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, well now I want to see this, because now I'm curious. Let's try it out. Let's see if it does the same thing. How many? Three to five sentences. Well, I'm just curious to see what it does. Because we already had chat GBT. Oops. right. right. Oh, you need it. Okay. Wait a minute. Oh, I sent you the wrong account. That's fine. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just curious if this does anything different. I don't know what we had before, because I used AI before, okay, no content, no content. Hey there, in this video, I'm going to- Okey-dokey, I don't remember that in the other one, so it would go to courses. this. Yeah. Um, preview. Hey, there. Okay. It did. must have just not clicked on that before. Okay. Anyway, before we begin, test your morning question. Oh, my goodness. This isn't the right thing to pick. Okay. So anyway, I've got a framework so I can plug things into that and I can work on that. And formatting, whatever. I don't really care about trying to do anything with that. So we want to have. Let's go in the Trello. That's not Trello. What does Trello's icon look like? There it is. Okay. So choose domain. We're going to go ahead and go with. I think that's for the go high level before, yeah, so open card, that's it by the dot IO. So and then that's, what's the check off, like do it, is that it? Complete, okay, so let's set up new guy, we're not doing this and Laura set up new domain, so we're going to change this at, we're going to just, just edit it, open card, okay, so set up, oh my gosh, I owe to the, Let's see. Yeah, I want members that profit drivers. Or alone. we'll do this profit drivers. owe to the homepage to sell the course. So. Let's just have rough draft version next week. And that's already sent to you. We're creating opt-in for the environment. Oh, that was supposed to be a page. this for like a couple weeks down and we'll create sales page for a little ticket offer with order bomb so that's kind of well so that's setting it up under sales page yeah um that's they're kind of the same i don't know can i make this like i need that what do you call it um a dependency like one's the domain one is the the the page and basically it could just be the whole thing integrate stripe and paypal we'll probably need to do that together yeah because it's in the time yeah and um and this is going to be with perfect slash funnel tips And that's me, and we'll just change that. So some goals are great goals. start off with what you like to create. Oh, that's for you for your.
00:22:12 - Laura L
Yeah.
00:22:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so this is. Done. Just archive. Wait, I don't want to archive. Yeah, that selected card. Okay. response.
00:22:28 - Laura L
You can get into that now, right? Yeah. It's now okay.
00:22:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. So that's it. It's not a lot, but it's really just getting familiar with Elementor to be able to pick a page or a template. So it's mostly kind of research, I guess. That will allow us to have the similar features of what I'm looking at. animations. Parallax. Just nice clean, but also easy. asked and then anything just poking around in Thinkethics so you know how to create a product just go ahead and create a sample product you should make that a thing create sample okay so actually few things create sample can I just maybe play around and do some tests if that's okay yes it's just believe it yes but I'm gonna I'm gonna have some specific tests that I want done and this is one of them so sample product $97 and we'll give that to you and then make one community three and one is $297 a month and so you can go ahead and like just get that set up in terms of once free and one one one to pay gate.
00:24:05 - Laura L
Yep.
00:24:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then just test opt-in, place on we'll call it profit drivers dot i o slash free. We'll do that one. Let's see. I'm a gift. I'll be gift. Yep. Whatever. So we just want to make sure that you've used all of the things and you see how they're work and you know how to navigate through it because even though I know that you're going to be able to figure it out, I don't want to have to wait for it when the time comes and we're ready to build. I'd rather you learn the platforms now and learn the navigation now. So when I go, hey, can you go do this? You're like, yeah, I know exactly where it's at. I know how long it's going to take me roughly, you know, it's going to take 10 minutes, 15 minutes and now, whatever. So and I'm happy to pay for that time where you're learning it and getting familiar with it because the way that I generally am is that there's a lot of laying the groundwork, laying the groundwork, laying the groundwork and then it's like, okay, let's go, let's go, let's go. Now, no, I need to be scared about that because my pace is my pace and who I'm working with, you know, we'll find what's compatible, but I will be like having all of this stuff. if you weren't able to do things, I'd probably be like, okay, where's that all we're doing? So yeah, I'm I get excited and I I definitely have seasoned and where like there's surges, we're having like super busy doing lots and then I'm not doing a lot for a while and so we can create just kind of a something where it's more even for you if that works best for you and where that kind of pace is still available to me. So we will figure all of that out. So don't want you to be scared about that. I was just saying week. That's how I am.
00:26:35 - Laura L
And by the way, Tina, I tried to check in last bus to make sure I actually don't have yet the access to funnel kit.
00:26:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's probably that you shared last time and yeah. Oh, marketing kit, what saving a lot of money. That's not it, okay, so let me log out, log out, log in, that did not have one, and let me check my e-mail and see where it went, what a long tune of my systems. Alright, well I guess we're going to figure this out, lots of password. And hopefully that's what it was. go. Please save that password because I forgot to copy it. Yay. Okay. Let's check on that. Okay. And then share with Miss Laura. All right. You want to check it?
00:28:35 - Laura L
Make sure you can get in. Okay. Yeah. I'll make sure to do that now. Okay. Yup, I'm in.
00:29:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Perfect. So, and can you get into the element or account?
00:29:21 - Laura L
Elementor. Thank you. Thank you. What's that? Sorry. Is it in final builder? like the account?
00:30:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you mean is it in funnel builder?
00:30:07 - Laura L
I'm sorry, actually on the account tab and I could see from here like your downloads.
00:30:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I see. Well, let's say, well, I don't know because I haven't used it.
00:30:28 - Laura L
Okay, yeah, not it, products. Yeah, I can, yeah, access it.
00:30:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay, cool. Let me elements are making me confirm from other it is. Email. Okay, so then I think I shared that. with you. Or maybe I shared the wrong one because I've got two in here. Oh yeah, they're both shared, so I don't know which one is right.
00:31:27 - Laura L
Okay, I would pick you right up.
00:31:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, but let's make sure that you can get in there before we get off.
00:31:45 - Laura L
Nice screen. Thank you. Yeah, just take me to the login options, like in Google and Facebook. Yeah, it's a sign-in to Elementor, it didn't take me to where the user name was. And password being built on both of them, for the others, it takes me directly to the correct one, but for the other one, it directed me to the sign-in option.
00:32:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I guess my question is, do either one of them work for you at all?
00:33:00 - Laura L
Yeah, let me share my screen so you could see what I need.
00:33:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so sure. Okay.
00:33:07 - Laura L
Share screen. Okay, sharing now. Let me close that one first and go back to here. So this one, the profit drivers. Okay, there's two. So if I launch, click launch. Yeah, it takes me to this.
00:33:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So scroll down where it says sign in with your email.
00:33:44 - Laura L
Okay.
00:33:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And now it's asking for the six digit code. Let me get that for you. Okay. There it goes. 415 483.
00:34:24 - Laura L
Okay, now I'm in.
00:34:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, great.
00:34:30 - Laura L
Is it the same with this one here?
00:34:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know. You'd have to look at the password side by side.
00:34:37 - Laura L
Okay, let me check this one.
00:34:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, wait, you can't see the password side by side, Yeah, I can't.
00:34:49 - Laura L
Yeah, it's the same thing. It's the same elementary account.
00:34:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, yeah, so I will just delete this one. And now there should only be one, but you should still have it.
00:35:06 - Laura L
Yeah.
00:35:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So you've got for CDM where I toasted, the only thing that you don't have is name cheap. So if you need to change any C name records or anything like that, then I can do that.
00:35:28 - Laura L
Okay.
00:35:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so you've got CDM, you've got Thinkific, Elementor and funnel kit and get response. That should cover everything.
00:35:46 - Laura L
Yep. Okay. for sorry, just one last thing for the Canva account.
00:35:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I haven't received the notification or invite to the team yet. Oh yeah, I think the thing was I needed to work on that and I forgot about it. See, where's my four people sending these people. Oh, she doesn't need to be there. Oops, I made a quick learn more. I don't need to learn more. Okay, and then. Oh, that's weird. What was the number?
00:36:55 - Laura L
I'm sorry, LRL two, five, eight. And she nailed that calm.
00:37:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And now let's check the teams of the five people for no extra cost, okay, and by people it's for the team, there we go. Okay, so that, just let me know if you're able to, what you call it, maybe in the email, okay, there we go. Yeah, and then projects, what we have, so I would invite, let's see, who has access to So that way, my logo is in there and my colors are in there and fonts, so that should, you'd be able to use that.
00:38:14 - Laura L
Okay.
00:38:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. Good question. else?
00:38:20 - Laura L
I think this all covers with all what I need for now.
00:38:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can send me a question on anything and then we'll just meet up next week and I would love it if those, if you can have those, like the sample products created by next week and just, if we could know what element or themes that there are like or templates have sent to review, if you want to try something, play around with it and see what it looks like. like so because the way that I I'm a visual person and until I like actually see it and there I'm like oh yeah okay that's it that's not it we can do that and I'm happy to pay for that time to make sure that we've really got it locked down okay this is this is what's gonna work for us this is gonna give us the features that we want and this is how it's gonna work together so yeah okay yeah I'll try to plot the I mean sales I mean the page and then yeah you could we could so we could also see the visual thing and Jeff put all the content there when ready okay awesome thank you thank you Tina I'm so excited okay have a great day I had to think about what time it is there yeah it's about yeah it's almost that was it 30 p.m. here so it's it's wind down time. Okay well then I will talk to you next week unless you have any questions.

Two Mark sweets.
00:00:01 - mark sweet
Yeah, I wasn't sure which one was right. So that's all right.
00:00:10 - mark sweet (3)
I just don't know one. They're just down just to one me.
00:00:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just you. That's OK. I just got up with Fuji this back to back meeting. I'm not used to it. And I'm like, I got to go.
00:00:25 - mark sweet (3)
No, he was asking me a question about multiple company names or a different company name for each day. what we have, if that wasn't really helpful. But his situation is a little different than mine because the tracking by a doctor name, not the only reason we have different companies for different states is more because of our trust account and because each day has different laws where it's a little different for him. So I mean, I'm the whole, it's better. But I don't think it's going to make a big difference.
00:00:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like. like um oh so I got to flip something for him. love when people think one thing about their business and then I'm like oh we go do some math and then you find out it's not that at all so July is actually way profitable way more profitable for him than Q and P.
00:01:18 - mark sweet (3)
Good.
00:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's pretty cool.
00:01:21 - mark sweet (3)
One quick thing from the legal side though just in a facamot, the CUNY practice that's legitimacy to his personal injury stuff.
00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh I'm not telling him he shouldn't do it. Okay. That was a nice like exciting thing for him to know that July was actually like that.
00:01:38 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah yeah good tea faces.
00:01:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh you guys always join on video and Fuji he said that it's more intimidating but like accountability so he's like I like when you're there because like I feel like I've got a I don't know pay attention so I think facial expressions which makes a difference rather than just seeing if on the earth. It's not okay.
00:02:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Great.
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My face is as crazy as my voice. Hi, Dan. What's up?
00:02:10 - mark sweet (3)
Okay.
00:02:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dan Jeep, my new voice.
00:02:15 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
My first, my second call.
00:02:18 - mark sweet (3)
voice hasn't warmed up yet.
00:02:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's my second call and mine has because I already got excited about nerdy numbers. There you go.
00:02:28 - mark sweet (3)
So this convention was interesting, the lawyer one. Everyone is just super, super, super excited about AI.
00:02:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, God, what don't they know that that ship was already sailed for about two years late? The K guys ship already sailed and sank.
00:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:02:49 - mark sweet (3)
What's in heaven and has it?
00:02:51 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
here's what saying, not like it has.
00:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It sounds like how you're talking about it. It's what?
00:02:57 - mark sweet (3)
It's not where it needs to be yet to be. effective. So it's never going to be.
00:03:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's it's it's always going to be about the promise. And say it from the beginning, he who engineers the promise wins. But the adoption rate by, you know, the general public is already on the decline. It only ever really hit 5%. And it's on the decline. So they're like, or this 's not, no one's going to use it. Most people don't even know what it is. They don't even know who the vice president is. And now she's running for president.
00:03:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They still don't know who she is.
00:03:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
She doesn't know. That's fine. And it's like, but, you know, there's the whole strawberry thing that just went around, right? couldn't count the R's and strawberry. It got it. If you ask Chachi B, Chachi Bt4, how many R's are in strawberry? it will tell you to right now. They haven't even fixed it. It's like, you should probably go fix that one. No, it can't do simple things. But that being said, I was talking to this buddy of mine.
00:04:15 - mark sweet (3)
The stuff that we've done that's really interesting is. I like fixed it. Now says the worst draw right contains three R letters.
00:04:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
There you go. It literally didn't work yesterday.
00:04:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, is it for me?
00:04:26 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Really?
00:04:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
00:04:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
See, it's not trustworthy. But if the stuff that we've done that's interesting is giving it the data set. So I think it's called RAG. I think the three letter thing is called RAG. And it's like, you're basically giving it a data set and then using it for its large language modeling against the data set that you trust, that you've said, hey, this is the thing. So it's good at that. And then if you, and if you then have it, you're updating that data set and or you're creating an application with it so that it remembers things and all that good stuff, then you're on another level. Then it can work. But what most people are doing is just like API and into chat, GPT. And it's like, yeah, not great.
00:05:25 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, the training the models were people are missing the huge problem. I agree with you, but it's time consuming and boring.
00:05:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, but most people second communicating and the way to make chat GPT work really well is to give excellent parameters. It's not just the prompting. It's the parameters of the prompting. Here are the boundaries. Also, here is the level of effort that you need to apply. So like if you ask at a basic thing, it puts forth basic effort. If you say, I want you to apply it as though you're this person using this logic, there's parameters, right? Completely different type of output. So like it said, there are two R's and I said try again and instead I apologize, there are three R's. So the other thing is you need to build in a check and balance system. So like I just told Fuji, I said go do your reports. I said, but then, because he's like, I'll use chat GPT do this. I said, okay, but then you need to go validate the data and make sure that what it told you is correct. And you can offer it for formulas and things like that. But the other part is most people aren't building in a check and balance system. I mean, have it in our government and not that it works, but whatever. there are also need to be something and that the problem is, and it's the same problem in every kind of business as people don't delegate. They, the hell is the word? You just give it off to people and you forget about it. My brain, I know this word is driving me nuts. Abdicate, people abdicate. So as soon as there is somebody that they think, can or will or something handle a problem for them. It isn't delegation. They just stop thinking about it. That's how embezzlement happens. That's how a lot of things happen. It's because people advocate, oh, this is my person for this. This is my system for this. It works. But we all know nobody and no thing works the same all the time. Life happens, human error, system error, economical error, whatever. So whatever system they build, there needs to be a quality assurance kind of check and balance system that gets built into it and whatever. It's not just about chat TBT and why I'm going off about all of this, but this is the thing that destroys a lot of businesses and a lot of more people when they get to the point where I can pay to delegate. Case in point, Mark, you haven't done anything bad, but I'm just saying this is the thing. You need to be a aware of in yourself don't how to keep the delegation right like we've had issues with our complaints and missing a statute because yeah so dealing with it yeah yeah delegating is one thing advocating is a thing you can't ever do and it has to be the most critical parts like why we why you resist the non-attorney model because attorneys have liability right and it's not just you owning all the liability you have somebody else in there that's got skin in the game and that's important because that that keeps a layer of protection against you strategically and i agree with that so the one interesting thing that keeps coming up and dandy you probably know more about this than i do is they're having these bots listening in on the calls for tonal shifts and for I guess voice for lack of very term is the person sound happy to add positive for us
00:09:00 - mark sweet (3)
some of these things. And obviously they're trying to pressure their problem like flags the call for a manager or supervisor to listen to it, whether it's a training issue or potentially an upset client or what happened.
00:09:11 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
There's no way it's listening to the tone.
00:09:14 - mark sweet (3)
No way.
00:09:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No disagree with you.
00:09:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure they're saying it. It would have to be a third party. They're not doing it.
00:09:25 - mark sweet (3)
They're using something that's already done it. If anything. Yeah.
00:09:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's probably more based on stop words than tone, right? Because just think the individual aspect of people's voices in general, right? how people speak differently. whether it's like people can't even pick out sarcasm text. People can't pick out sarcasm voice. Top words. Words of frustration. Words of anxiety. Words of that all day long. can see that being more effective than. and then looking for a tone or trying to identify tone. It could be a combination of the two, maybe, but I bet it leans more towards the word itself first.
00:10:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do think it's the word. So right now Chat TBT can tell you the tone of words, text. it does that. don't think it's, and also how much you can pick up sarcasm, especially thick sarcasm. I don't know how good it's at that. But the thing is, if people keep it in perspective, and this is what I think most people won't do, which is actually a benefit to all the other people who are going to be smart, is that you take it as a potential data point to go, like basically a flicker to go say, what's happening over here and go listen to it yourself and go, is this right? than I'm going to go and this is a problem person because Chat TBT keeps saying all their people are angry. angry and maybe it just can't even recognize it right or whatever.
00:11:03 - mark sweet (3)
You be able to figure out something like yelling or screaming.
00:11:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, it's it's going to be in this middleware. They're putting a middleware in place. I don't think that's yeah, I don't think that that's necessarily native to Chad GPT. So, I don't know if it's something else. It is. That's all anyone's using.
00:11:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, we'll see it open AI. That's what Chad GPT is, but it's open AI. it's all it's going to be so interesting, but keeping here's what we're talking We're talking and you're interrupting you.
00:11:45 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That don't track anything.
00:11:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You don't track anything. It's important to keep everything in containers, but that's what to your point of tracking is it's easier to do when they're in containers. Right. Daniel.
00:12:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean, it's just, it's all sizzle, right? It's typical lawyer , right? Those guys are the most easily sold people on Earth.
00:12:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's It's unreal.
00:12:16 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, I'm not very excited by Shawnee Ball. And I have no idea how to implement it, what it actually does in the background.
00:12:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and then they're not going to track it. So it's like, you don't even, if you did it, are attracted to what it is? Oh, yeah.
00:12:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, I'm pretty sure you got to have a lot of that to be an attorney, period, or just collectively coming from somebody that was one of my career choices.
00:12:45 - mark sweet (3)
There are multiple more to do this. Coquitos, one, apparently.
00:12:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
What, Pekker? What?
00:12:52 - mark sweet (3)
a weird name that is.
00:12:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
See you. Yeah, I just thought about it.
00:12:56 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:12:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are you looking at?
00:13:00 - mark sweet (3)
So, could you use a real-time AI system to analyze the live phone calls that take customer sentiment provide agents with live cushion and feedback, uses voice analysis, introvert motion, infuse like stress or enthusiasm. There's the observed.ai, does kind of the same thing.
00:13:16 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I mean, I don't think you need a real time, right? you could just find something that allowed you to download recordicals and mass-analyze those to like help nail a script first, right? Like, you know, they don't need like any or support yet, right? If you got a script that worked and you're like, okay, this script is solid. Now, the only way this script goes sideways is through the execution thereof. Therefore, now layer on something where you know it's not gonna try, it's just gonna sort of try to make them be more successful with the script, but maybe.
00:13:55 - mark sweet (3)
Maybe, I mean, the issue, and I'm sure we're coming up is these larger teams, right? Because if you've got, take, for example, and it's alerting you that Marie is not doing a good job for whatever reason, right? You would want someone to listen to it take it over because you could potentially have a large case, right, your hands. Doctors office was calling in super frustrated. You want to know right away rather than after the fact, after the problem.
00:14:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right, so like, I like the large case, right? But that would be like a word that could be like a stopboard based thing too, right? It's like, hey, if they say UPS truck, 18 wheeler, you know, you're like, oh, those are like, not stop words, but those are like flag words. Uh oh, this could be a commercial, you know, that kind of thing. But that would be the extracted via the script, right? So there's where the script would come into play to then sort of like was Tina was saying, sort of like what I was saying, you're not writing a prompt, you're just making making data available to the prompt, that's the prompt will say, hey, I can use that. Hey, that's something that I'm supposed to be looking for, and then it does its thing.
00:15:11 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, no, I mean, that was one big one. The other big one is, you know, even up does AI demand writing, which I don't know.
00:15:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, that I can see for sure.
00:15:20 - mark sweet (3)
Makes sense.
00:15:21 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
But you would do it, you could do that right now, but it's just a matter of you having a self, I mean, it seems like the, and this is what I literally was doing yesterday because, you know, I'm a loser. But I'm like, okay, I can just have the data in the Google sheet in like a row. And I just say, hey, this row. And I keep telling chat GPT, like, I don't need to build the database at this rate, but I need to someplace to store the data and say you're using this. Then it's a matter of like, you give it a demand. Let's say you get, let's. it's a demand for a dog bite or whatever, whatever it is, it's a car accident.
00:16:06 - mark sweet (3)
That's what we do.
00:16:07 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, do a car accident. But like, give me an example of one where you'd be like, it's a tip, like the setup where like, this is the demand is based on these four or five things. Like, is there a scenario like that?
00:16:24 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. So you're generally going to have liability. Number one, like, how did it happen? Who's that fault?
00:16:31 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay. So you're saying, yeah, injuries and injuries is the part you spend the most amount of time on.
00:16:37 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. Three state specific, which state did it happen in? And four is the rest of the board of plate template, quite frankly, you know, the terms and conditions and kind of the opening and just the boiler plate template.
00:16:51 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. So you have the first one probably has a fault, not a fault, right?
00:16:56 - mark sweet (3)
it just binary or is there a third? No, there's a third. Okay.
00:17:02 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So you, it's one of the three. And then the next one, so the injury would be the most complicated one, right? You'd have to then go through your database that you have, and litify like, Hey, here are all the possible injuries.
00:17:15 - mark sweet (3)
And then you'd have to build like a sort of matrix, which I can totally see with. Hold on. So when I say injuries, it's pulling from the medical workers of that specific client with what they had.
00:17:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Right. So, but you'd say, like, Hey, had an MRI. They had this. had that. So what is the number more based on the treatments than the actual injury? Like, Oh, it was their neck MRI. you build like a matrix and say they had MRI, this, this, this, this. And then maybe, and then the prices or whatever are included. So it's like, if you could dynamically say, Hey, like imagine, filling in a form and you're like, it's, it's not at fault, it's MRI, that, that, that, right, select checkboxes. And then it's whatever, whatever the next one is. So they submit the form, that goes in that then temporarily updates the set of fields. then the prompt go, then it hits the prompt and the prompt set, the prompt is written to say, Hey, you're going to look after it's half fault and you're going look at this and you're going to look at these injuries, then go look at this data set that has the injury pricing or whatever, or you're including that price. You're saying it's MRI 5000, it's this, blah, blah, whatever it is. And then the prompt is just waiting for you to give it those parameters. And then it goes and looks at your ideal demand, let's call it, which there's probably an ideal one, right? then boom, you'll write it and then the quick ideally you would write all this and you'd have a demand that's done well to compare it to. You say, okay, if I feed it this data, does the demand that spit out come out like this? Yes or no?
00:19:09 - mark sweet (3)
you see how to train it, like the ones already being written first, hey, mean, this information, no, here's a better example.
00:19:15 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
There's no way you could train that. Then you just start massaging that prompt in the middle.
00:19:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's like what we were having Fuji work on with his reports is feeding the data and the analytical process as much as possible. But then the other thing is the system for sure that should be built in is human approval.
00:19:42 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, yeah, no, doesn't just get sent out on and so.
00:19:46 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, well, and you could human score it at the end to go, now that's of three or the lawyer scores. Somebody, somebody that you trust their scoring.
00:19:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That right there. Mark's score basically for a while, and then train somebody that scores according to your approval. That's the thing for, okay, so going back to the application conversation and just the pace of the technology and the evolution, the innovation that is available right now is leveraged, all of this is AI stuff is leveraged if it's used right, but all of it has to be something that you learn firsthand, everything has to be. For example, okay, so Dan, the foundation of basis really is numbers tell the whole story, so we need to be able to have the numbers. When it comes to online businesses, most of those numbers come through the website, so the analytics. So he's diving into GA4, which is Google Analytics 4, right? It's a whole new beast. We've been using Google Analytics. I've been using it since 2002, probably. I think it was out. Maybe it wasn't that old. Maybe a few years after that. Let's see, 2008, I was getting into split testing. So anyway, we'll say maybe like 2005, people were already starting to use Google Analytics. And now it's an entirely different kind of thing. It's this whole host of a suite, basically, of things that you used to have to get somewhere else. But Google owns all of it. And because it's so new, even the experts are still just kind of figuring out how to use it. So he has a massive leverage opportunity to be an innovator right now, which is a business owner who understands how to tap into Google Analytics. And so he's doing it. He's been studying it for weeks. From an expert who I know personally and I've met and he that's all he's been doing is this this whole time So he's been going growing with it But Dan can't delegate this to anybody right and If he could it would cost it wouldn't it wouldn't be worth it The only one he could delegate to would be another expert. So for you with the marketing with the with the AI but also The business the culture all of these things coalesce into Something very unique for you specifically and subsequently sweet law, which does have its own Unique identity and culture, but I'm just saying The things that interest you If it's innovative and leverage the more you spend time on that and getting real data Talking with Dan. I'm kind of helpful with these things Sometimes he spends more time in it. But anyway, um, there, there's a lot of opportunity to at least figure out how we can shave a little time here and there. So we've been talking about the path to growth is optimization and leverage. This is it. If you can improve the script through analysis data, right, with AI, if you can improve, and not just the intake script, but the attorney's want to script two for certain types of scenarios so that they can be handling things more consistently. So like Lorenz for Mike or the case managers, actually, basically everybody, certain scripts for certain scenarios, they feel like they could be trained better to handle specific types of people and scenarios. Because they know their job that people handling is not what their best at knowing the law and case handling is what their best at people handling is a necessary part of managing the case well so like we've been talking about call control scripts or just I brought up the phrase a few times but when I brought it up to runs sorry hold on and when he brought it up to his team they all want training I need to tell you this by the way it was the last last week conversation but so using AI to kind of help us find scripts if you are listening somehow to all the calls in sweet law and can identify who handles inside the team already the best types of people like if we were able to and that we're not here yet I don't think with the AI but something to keep in mind about like best case scenario best use cases would be okay who handles um specific death cases who handles any type of thing or any type of person and they could label it by the language that's used um and then say okay this person does a really great job of handling this type of person like Mike with distributions. So what Mike does that Lauren said that stand out is Mike doesn't take it personal and he kind of scapegoats the the law firm he's like my hands are tired I can't this is just the rule like I'm I'm not the one deciding that this is what we're gonna get paid this is policy but for whatever reason the way that he says it diffuses the situation and then he can get the full attorney fees more often than other people without people being odd and so that's a skill right but is there a teachable not not necessarily scripts but maybe a logic so is there a verbal cue of some but he says this, respond this way, and the result is this. This kind of analysis, which you'd have to listen to so many calls to be able to do that, but if we could get to the point where I think we can, probably in the next year or two, AI could do that really well, and you could identify, you read the book switch, right? Do you remember the phrasing, bright spots? Okay, so they are the anomalies where everything is bad and then all of sudden you've got something that's just amazing, and a lot of times it was something that already existed, so it was a resource that you already own. I'll give you the example and I'll throw this in for you Dan. So there was this guy, he had to go to some Asian culture, I don't remember where it was, where the children were malnourished, and he had about six weeks in a very minimal budget and had to overhaul it and improve their nutrition. And he was a college, something that was funded through college and so you know he had to succeed with all these limits but what they did is they calmed all the data and they found out that there was one location where the children were actually doing really really well and so they went down there and they observed their daily life and they noticed that the mothers when they were working in the rice fields that they would take the shrimp that they found in the water and added into the kid's rice and so they were getting protein and so the kids were healthier and that actually was available to everybody else in the culture but it wasn't a practice across that that area I don't even remember where it was I wish I did I read it like 10 years ago anyway so that resource was available to everybody but only one person was using it so they didn't need a new budget they just needed to tell people use what's in front of you put it in the rice give it to your kids they'll be better you may boom right so it already existed so my point is that if we can get better data, even more deeper data stuff that we've never even thought about really looking into, because it was a pain in the and Mark doesn't like pain in the is data. I just had this conversation with the other person like I don't want to do that. Anyway, um, friends go figure. Anyway, um, then we can figure out where are the bright spots in sweet loss. Like, is there something that Samantha does on calls that makes her even better? Um, I think that there's going to be more that we can figure out. And if we can figure out how to safely, ethically reliable, reliably get AI into, listen to these calls and give us some kind of info. That would be, we could really improve and up level all of your existing people. with feedback from what's already happening inside this route. I wore myself out talking too much. But anyway, hopefully that was useful. Dan, you're quiet. Are you in a rabbit hole?
00:29:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, I'm like sitting here going, I think I could build a demand rider right now with high level. I think because you don't need, you don't. So right now we, for the AI bot that closes people into appointments, we've trained it. So it has this massive prompt that it's always referencing, but the prompt is in a document. So that's the data storage example that I was getting earlier. Here, it's just, I don't know if it's a text file. can't remember. But, and then we let it round. And then we massaged it based on the outcome, we said, oh, don't do that, do this, don't do that. So now I'm like, okay, we just sort of mapped out the parameters. Obviously, it's not exactly right, but it's in the neighborhood. There's not that many. So it's like, okay, you had a form and then you, the form had these elements in it. And then you said, you just have someone fill out that form. Again, it's just all going to be about the prompt. So if I fill out that form and I send it to the prompt, what do I get at the output, right? And that's a very, like, we don't need a production ready, passable, blah, blah. What's the point in doing all that if it doesn't work, right? are around the sizzle. Hey, we're going to go build a business around this sizzle. But... If the stake is no good, I don't care how easily it is. And that's, what are the odds, right? That, I mean, I can tell you right now, I'd be willing to bet a lot that none of these companies have a pre-lit lawyer at the helm saying that's a good demand, right? And let's face facts. What do you need at the end? You need a good demand. What's a good demand? The one that gets you more money than the demand, right? They don't even have a comparative, but they don't know good from bad. It's like, well, I met with the absurdly guys and they were telling me, which we need to talk about them later, they had what might be another Arizona firm backed by P.E. Money that they sold a thousand leads to. But let's say their leads are $250 a piece, which they may or may not be. can't remember their present. So they dropped 250. Yeah, they drop this, this firm, whoever they are, drop $250,000. And then they were like to add sardly. How do we know this is working? Come again. You guys don't know what to do. So then the ads are like, well, you know, you're going to want to look at how many you convert to a retainer, like, what is that blah blah blah. is over the course of like two or three months, and then they pulled the plug and they said, okay, we're going to stop and we're going to evaluate and see what the outcome is. Pardon, your outcome is not coming for about six more months.
00:32:41 - mark sweet (3)
FYI.
00:32:42 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
If you're lucky, if you have lawyers. So clearly, nobody in that project was an actual personal injury lawyer, ever worked in a law firm, any idea how these things go. So they just see, oh, sizzle, can have non lawyer. partners. Let's go. Woohoo. Then they would say I stuff, right? So all you really need to do is just, it's all about the prompt. The prompt will be is the ultimate piece of IP. It's not chat TPT.
00:33:15 - mark sweet (3)
Anyone can access that.
00:33:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's the piece in the middle. And having a good demand as an example choose to say these guys even know what a good demand is. And then your point, that demand might need to be financed by state, right? You can't just have a demand demand demand demand demand, right? They're not all the same yet. That's how they position it. And then they just slap this huge price tag on it.
00:33:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
None of the sites have pricing on it, which is always a digital way. If you build anything, that's AI related, Dan, and it is prompt related. What I want you to do is build a dummy test scenario that you run through regularly because my experience is that the output is changing. For example, I have a game that I like to play, and I like to get some photographs, and I have a group, whatever. It's my little, it's my little unwind thing. But I noticed that the output of the group was kind of low, so you help people, so you don't have to buy boosters and upgrades to get through things, and I like to do that, whatever. So I started giving stats, and we went from 200 helps a week to 2,000 to 200 helps a week in a matter of like a few weeks, because they gave people stats. But anyway, I use AI to screenshot all of the players and their rankings and their helps, and it did it really well in the beginning, and now I'm having an issue with the same exact prompt and the same exact data, getting it to give me the same kind of report. So what that alerted me to is that I need to have a test prompt and a test result, right? So if I ask you to do this, I expect a specific type of output. If I give you the same exact prompt every single time, I should get something within 99% of the same kind of output. Because if you're building, let's say, a demand writer, and you give it the parameters, and all of a sudden the algorithm in the background changes. And now, or, and this is what I actually think happened, more, what's the word, the law changes, and they just can find what it can do? If the parameters change in the algorithm, if anything changes in the algorithm, then it would change your output. So, but they're not going to tell you that this happened. Even if they tell you there's changes, whatever. or people are going to pay attention to it. So what I think that you should have, if you have anything that's AI based, is a test that says, you know, if I give you this, you output this, it's the same every time. So make sure that you're still getting the same kind of function.
00:36:14 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Does that make sense? Yeah.
00:36:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Even on private servers that's still having the same issue. Yeah, because you're hooking it, unless you wrote your own AI, if you're hooking into OpenAI through an API, you're still using their stuff. And if the law has changed, which does happen, legislature changes, know, they can't do, what they can't do, how it can be used ethically, whatever, something can change the way it's able to respond to you, then it may change your output. It may say, well, I ethically can't give you that. And maybe the work around is the way you ask the question. maybe you simply can't get it whatsoever, but either way, if you don't have something to test the quality and go, hey, or maybe you find out that the output hasn't improved with your test, like your dummy test, what you call it? Whatever, prompt. back to checks and balances, if you're using AI, there should be a foundational fundamental, this is my test that you can still do what I've been assuming that you're doing and that you're doing it with the same kind of logic so that you know if the logic has improved or just gotten worse or you know the output has changed. I don't think anybody's thinking about that or building that. I'm sure somebody is, but I haven't heard anybody say it yet, so but we have to take that into account because the outputs do change and there's stuff happening in the programming behind the scenes that they're not going to be like, hey, just you know, you know this.
00:38:00 - mark sweet (3)
One of other hard parts of what we do is the medical side of it. And what I mean by that is we've got to bring all these medical workers together and, um, prelet side, we can redact things that are bad, um, and put it in a way that puts our client in less payroll. Like, I don't know how to train a bot to be able to do that.
00:38:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can. I'm sure there's ways of knowing you know, it's not hard. It's fronting. Okay. I could help you with that.
00:38:28 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Like you can. Turn to do what?
00:38:31 - mark sweet (3)
So we'll have, let's say, hospital records, right? We really just want to only provide the best things. I don't want to be hard to where it says like they're on Matt, um, bad for us. And in pre litigation, we don't have to necessarily share all the records. Okay. pre litigation, we don't. And so a large part of why attorneys are doing the demands in my office, because I won't use records to pull out the bad stuff to hide it.
00:38:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
War games screenshot in my head. play a game. But the reason is though, because chat GPT does have some rules about what it can do ethically, but if you put in the parameter, let's play a game, we're going to role play. This is your role. Your role is to share this information, but to make sure that we never insinuate or allude to drug usage or this or this or this or whatever. You lose the game if you reveal x, y, z, whatever, and that logic can work.
00:39:34 - mark sweet (3)
Okay.
00:39:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, again, it's going to be a matter of like having a stop word sort of library, I can't the word, that, you know, you can start it right off the gate, right, heroin, meth, right, like there's something you're going get, but then you're going to miss one, right? But as long as you can then update that. database or however that record exists, then you'll get to it, right? So it's the path to getting to the right version is just iterative beta testing with yourself, right? So you turn, like how many cases do you settle a month?
00:40:21 - mark sweet (3)
don't even know, I don't pay attention to number.
00:40:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay, so you have 80 examples a month, right? you actually use these demands, you could run 80 demands through this thing, and it's going to learn pretty quick, right? It should learn around, I would say 300, you get about 300 in there, and you should have a statistically significant outcome. Now, it's just a matter of doing, right? You do it and look at it and go, yeah, that's good, that's bad, this part's right, this part's wrong. But it's going to learn through actual real world data, god forbid.
00:41:01 - mark sweet (3)
Like you said a rating and like this one's a two out of ten. This one's an eight out of ten. So that way.
00:41:05 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yep. Yep Yeah, exactly and it's you grade it and then give it feedback what was wrong. This is what was wrong Yeah, this is like I talked to Salco about this months ago once once We got through it. was like, oh wait, this could be done. like it can be done. It just you have to do it Yeah, right. I'm I'm sure if you set up one of these services and then run a demand through what comes out You're gonna be like, this is not great And they'll go oh, we're working on it.
00:41:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're working on it.
00:41:40 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
How are you working on it?
00:41:42 - mark sweet (3)
No, that's literally my concern is this just gonna be what they have which is the same as just a template pulled together, right? my own thing then someone else's right because you need to us Then with their every situation where we can make it like a one butt click from ourselves for us or no
00:42:01 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
probably, but that's like the next level, right? Then you have to go right, sales course app version, but the parts that you would you carry over would be the prompt, right? Then you just have to say, Oh, this, this front end. Let's say the front end is just always a form. Oh, this front end form needs to be a whatever their language is called. I forgot what it's going, but it needs to be a blah, blah, form, but then it's still going to go hit any API for charge, even tea, and then it's going to output it inside of the sales force app. And then probably turn into a PDF or whatever.
00:42:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And just a reminder, an encouragement, although I think you get excited enough about the stuff that you don't need it, but the habit that we have of iterations and also just so So you start building something knowing it's not the end product. It's. going to change, you're going to have to do some rework, but it's not really rework because it's iterative, because it's going to have been improved, because you will have learned something that it's then a compounding effect of what you started with and a little bit of a tweak, but in terms of like building something and then hooking it into Salesforce, when you try to have a conversation with somebody ambiguously, like there's no nothing really specific and they're just trying to imagine what that looks like, you're dealing with the limitations of their brain, whereas if you have something that already exists, now you're talking to a coder who deals with API, plus who's familiar with Salesforce and what the options are and whatever, then it becomes much easier conversation because you have a foundation to start with. So if you're willing to put the elbow prison and spend some time trying to figure out a base level framework and get it. started what happens is the same thing that happens every time we've created any type of framework around data or systems or whatever is that you look at it and you're like oh I didn't think about this I didn't think about this and it is a revelatory revelatory process that makes everything else easier but usually what happens is people just think it think it think it think it think I'd like to think the solution you can't you create the solution then the real solution presents itself so you're in the position now of just I mean whether it be something that you use to massively leverage sweet law and I say massively but let's think about it on an energy level and also just kind of alleviating what's tedious or minutia for you and for your people when you have the ability to conserve conserve that energy then all that energy gets to put into higher leverage activity so in and of itself Oh, that is a great play, but then if you create a system that is now kind of proprietary system that you can go sell and monetize, but also not just, you know, coldly because you can go make money, but you also go to get to help your friends use a system. And then you find all of the, you know, related type of activities that it can be used for different types of markets, the dog food like there's. Just using AI to analyze and figure out things. I mean, there's, there's so many plays to it if you're willing to sit there and think and work out the solutions like as much time as Dan is spent in high level. And as much time as you spent just researching and marketing and having all these conversations with different people you put all of that together and. Pretty awesome.
00:45:50 - mark sweet (3)
think. Yeah, no, Dan's super anonymous me almost thought this is all, but if we can actually build the stake behind this is all then we've got something.
00:46:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And even if you only use it for yourself, I have many tools that I've built just for me. I enjoy them daily.
00:46:10 - mark sweet (3)
But as you like to say, Dan, what are the hardest people to sell?
00:46:14 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, no, would be, you know, the best products are the ones that solve your own problem, right? And it's not just you know, it's not just your problem, right? And then then you also have tied to that, the whole story brand aspect of, oh, yeah, no, you know, it's trite to say, build for Laurie's bio borders. But in this scenario, it's not, it's not trite. mean, it's, I don't know if that gets used a lot actually in this space, to be honest, but you know, we get built from, built from marketers by marketers, but it's, it's true. And it's like, you know, you could, then you can go into this whole story brand aspect of it. And also results before and after, before. before demand rider, after demand rider, right? Whether it's saving time, it's an increase, like Salco's convinced that you can increase your bottom line through ruptured, like really dialing in the demands.
00:47:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can increase my bottom line.
00:47:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
that's true, if that's true, let's say that does happen, you're also going to free up time for lawyers, which may or may not have a result, but it's quantifiable, right? These are the these are the cornifiable outcomes of this thing.
00:47:40 - mark sweet (3)
So, we just kind of need to pick A-Link to start with, I guess, for lack of a better term, because there's just so many options for where to go, but demands make the most sense.
00:47:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Organizers get them processed, analyze, start there. So, first, it would be getting files that could be fed,
00:48:00 - mark sweet (3)
to AI first securely there is one other thing that I think actually AI can do very very well and it's already somewhat in our system which is pulling by insurance companies and by adjusting their settlements and what total damages are produced damages are to see who we do better with and who we don't do as well with and see if there's anything between doctors we use and don't use yeah I don't have enough data for everything everything but at least we could tell by insurance company and get it started and it's just feeding more data as things go yeah like State Farm I think that now they are very bad State Farm to State Farm things and they're on there we're going to let you get lot of stuff because we're spending too much money which they go every like three to five years between this yeah that was the interest that uh that thing that Josh showed us is doctor thing and then how I when I when he pulled that up I was like wait a second
00:49:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Like he, he's like, oh, you can use this to find doctors, which I thought was interesting, but then he was also saying that it did that. It should, it allowed you to then look at your outcome per doctor. So you could be like, you know what, this doctor doesn't get as good as this doctor. But then you could go back to that tool and be like, I need a new pain management dude in this area. And then all of a sudden, here's the 20 guys in that area.
00:49:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know if anybody remembers somebody was asking about tracking doctors and creating his spreadsheet for that, just so we can get that data. Bring any bells at all. Oh, yeah.
00:49:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So his thing, his thing does it. I also thought it was interesting. Did you catch this mark? was like, hey, wait, what? So he basically was like saying that your firm's bigger than theirs, right?
00:49:55 - mark sweet (3)
That was the bye I was getting yet.
00:49:57 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Didn't he also say that they refer out three?
00:50:00 - mark sweet (3)
hundred cases a month.
00:50:01 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I was like, wait, what?
00:50:03 - mark sweet (3)
Yes. Now, how many hours, how many are actually like retained or referred out? think are different numbers.
00:50:11 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay, yeah, me too. This was the conversation I had with the ads, certainly guys. Yeah. So oh, yeah, back to that. They gave me all the data on this. We'll just say it was the new Arizona firm. They converted 14% of those leagues. But that's with their version of I'm sure those guys were just retainers, right? They're gold. metric is retainers. It's like, no, the metric is cases. They are different.
00:50:42 - mark sweet (3)
No, I could believe if your criteria is crap, then mine, right? have a great tier. I can believe 14% fairly is because we're at what percent would have certainly like five?
00:50:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's everyone's five.
00:50:57 - mark sweet (3)
Right? Right?
00:50:59 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's like that number comes up all
00:51:00 - mark sweet (3)
time. I don't know how to refer it out as how many 10 10 percent.
00:51:06 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:51:07 - mark sweet (3)
So yeah.
00:51:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. So we need to get so we need to get that in place which we talked about before like there's referred out and then we need we need to differentiate with out for referral and then as been referred out because right now it seems like things are referred out but if you pointed out on those three or four that I sent you you're like I don't think anyone's going to take those however the system says refer it out so I'm like we need to change that.
00:51:34 - mark sweet (3)
Oh yeah absolutely no it's still referred out because again we're going find anything from even from the jobs 50 percent if one out of you know 10 they get some money on but still one more that I wouldn't have any money in.
00:51:47 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well yeah the quick math we did a couple of weeks ago was it's five grand so it's like okay five grand you know nothing especially if it's just a phone call but if you were to go in right now and say refer it out times 5,000, that would be a false number. It's not really that. So, I actually talked to Isaac about that. He's going through the Salesforce course. He's learning some things.
00:52:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, speaking of Josh, what does he have for us in reports right now? You were saying that he could do the...
00:52:20 - mark sweet (3)
We had a really cool meeting that you're going to like, but he needs a little time to put it together.
00:52:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I heard about it. I'm really upset I didn't get to be there.
00:52:27 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Listen, it was I don't meet with him ever. So super, he was like, can we do it Thursday? I was like, uh, okay. But normally it's all email. It's not face to face. Or zoom or anything. And it's actually normally it's email through Stacy.
00:52:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't even email him. No recording.
00:52:52 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I don't get to hear all the smart stuff. You don't.
00:52:56 - mark sweet (3)
I'm sorry. I like the end result of it.
00:52:59 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So that's a good part.
00:53:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like the conversations because then my brain goes, whoa, this is good.
00:53:05 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay, fine. He knows this for sure.
00:53:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but here's the thing. He's the guy who has access to all the data I have been asking for for years.
00:53:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Some of it.
00:53:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:53:19 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
For sure.
00:53:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Either way, it's just I decided to see.
00:53:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, yeah, you have to his thing builds it. So that data doesn't really exist with his add on. It can. So it's like he, he has two apps that he, I guess, sells. don't know. He didn't actually get it. He did not try to sell us on them at all, which was also funny. He just showed to show them to us and he's like, nerding out on them. I like, yeah, but it's kind of interesting. I suppose we could ask him how much the app is.
00:53:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It might be it. Could you do that and ask him to like. I'm gonna tape a demo and let's just hope that he just gets really geeky in there.
00:54:04 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, he will.
00:54:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, he will.
00:54:06 - mark sweet (3)
thinking about this though.
00:54:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Let's see. Oh, yeah.
00:54:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, will you ask for that?
00:54:14 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm already doing it.
00:54:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. Okay. This is gonna be fun. See that and somebody who is excited to go create it and get it for us. I mean, you guys, that's a golden kiss right there. Golden Goose. Okay. Um, uh, down you said you needed to talk about the answer to the guys, but was that what you just talked about? Also, yay for record month.
00:54:45 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, that's good. I was not outrageous. So what was not outrageous? Or spend like we didn't over spend to try to get to that number.
00:54:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What did you spend?
00:54:58 - mark sweet (3)
I don't have the final number. Because they're still adding stuff into the system. So like the very, very rough number. Was. About 420 case spent.
00:55:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And.
00:55:23 - mark sweet (3)
The other week or so we should have the final final numbers, but it looks like it should be around that. Numbers are going to go down and it'll just go up. So it might be, you know, instead of 4,100, 4,250, which is still a lot better than where we were.
00:55:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, would you divide that by incident or people incident. Okay. Okay.
00:55:49 - mark sweet (3)
If I'm trying to sell or from trying to like position myself, I do it obviously by people because it looks better and how 99% of firms look at things. I just don't look at that way from the market. Because again, it's one call, it's not three different calls, right?
00:56:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:56:08 - mark sweet (3)
Um, and they also include their drops and subouts and then try to pull those out as well. Because if we kept those numbers, if we look by person and by drops of outs, then we're at 126, that brings the number down to, you know, 33, which is a significant difference from 4,100.
00:56:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's, I mean, that's really good. Yes. And your subout rate, what we haven't done, which I want to do when we're starting to track it, is just kind of figure out what that percentage is, 8% roughly, right now. But I'm tracking it over time.
00:57:01 - mark sweet (3)
I mean, in this case, it was just, there was one set out where someone signed with three firms in total. Um, I mean, the drops, I put the reasons why all of them in total sense. Um, you know, one, maybe we could have done a better job of the upfront just to try to keep them with their response. If everything else was, you know, a pretty good reason, um, you know, stopping right after a setup. So we need to figure out, is there something better once they sign an agreement to get them to feel better with us? And both those were HQ intakes. So I need to see what we can do to shore that up. I don't know if the HQ intakes do it in Vegas. The guy who runs it's about four, uh, five foot two.
00:57:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not so bad. Hey, that's a good height.
00:57:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
For a guy. Mm hmm.
00:57:51 - mark sweet (3)
who? ball guy with mustache.
00:57:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or Portuguese girl.
00:57:54 - mark sweet (3)
Okay. Okay. Um, because you're coping. Myers is trying to buy all their leads. California, because they have a lead generation business goes with it. They're doing that nationwide, but they're having issues and having to like fire some clients. They like to work with us because we're relatively easy to work with and we get in the answer to the phone. We actually follow up. So. I'm trying to steer away from them saying everything Jacoby is obviously one more. Their cost is 3,500 per retainer. including their cost.
00:58:26 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's not. It's not late.
00:58:27 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:58:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So their lead to they close it themselves. Correct. Oh. Have you seen what? Well, you've gotten it, but it's not. You've already seen what they signed. Right. So what percentage.
00:58:45 - mark sweet (3)
And I see you respond to them.
00:58:47 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:58:48 - mark sweet (3)
It doesn't seem very. I say 10% we say, what did you sign this?
00:58:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Exactly. So I was going to say probably still about 10% right. So they're not. Cucouville as far as signing the wrong stuff.
00:59:05 - mark sweet (3)
Now, can I get the price point? may make sense, but I don't know.
00:59:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, it's going to. Yeah, let's say, yeah, if it puts it up at 4,500, remember, um, could score work.
00:59:18 - mark sweet (3)
Look, in special outcomes.
00:59:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Analyzing as a vendor.
00:59:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:59:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so just will just will have the per vendor. That's what I was going to ask.
00:59:34 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, we're doing per vendor per state, and then we're checking the ROA all the way through to see what our ROI is on each source.
00:59:41 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:59:43 - mark sweet (3)
But then hopefully we also add on per attorney. So we'll see which attorneys doing what.
00:59:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, understand you guys all like want growth and they don't get excited about anything and really celebrate the win. That's a big celebration.
00:59:58 - mark sweet (3)
And then you should celebrate with your whole team and tell them. They're reading large bonuses this month so i'm already um super thrilled about spending more money.
01:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean that's not the only way to celebrate you can just oh i need to schedule another like follow-up meeting with you too. I want to do that.
01:00:16 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah almost sixty two thousand dollars this past month on bonuses which is a lot.
01:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a lot um yeah but you don't have to just use money to thank people.
01:00:30 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah people like money.
01:00:32 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
They do like money but they also like praise.
01:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They do in LA. They also like praise and knowing especially yours.
01:00:41 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah they also like money.
01:00:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh whatever. Okay um so we spend a lot of time talking about the AI stuff just one other Just want to start getting up over one because it's going to take a lot of time to get it right.
01:00:55 - mark sweet (3)
Like it's not this is not okay. By next week we got a process. That'd be cool but. that's not yeah likely um but in every case that we get the policy limit on meaning we get the most amount um circling those to feed because we always want to give chat sheet see the best data although guess we can say hey oh void writing demands like this as well yes you so you want to a high low yeah yeah for sure and it's worth all the effort to organize that data to feed it correctly and then give it the parameters and really have um measure the output based off of the prompt there's there's a lot of leg work to do but then once you do it it goes really fast so um i mean i think that's really it uh is there anything else that we should discuss rather um then try to start any new conversations right now that was a good conversation and especially because
01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we're leverage and optimization, which is really the overarching, you know, target that we have the most out of the least.
01:02:08 - mark sweet (3)
So we can go with Dan, you know, there's more money to be made for Dan and for me, for the separate side projects that are not just the law for themselves. And I want to make Dan and myself lots of extra money.
01:02:20 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So, you know, there you go.
01:02:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll just watch.
01:02:24 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, look, this is the doctor run, right?
01:02:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
doctor notes like I'm down for it. I got lots of time to work.
01:02:32 - mark sweet (3)
So yeah, I want to hire a teen and make her my money too. She's not.
01:02:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, okay. So is there anything that's pressing anything that we should know or just to bring that for an agenda for next week? On either side.
01:02:54 - mark sweet (3)
And this month, I'll be waved into Colorado and to We don't have anybody in Colorado to do it. We have both Fuji and agape.
01:03:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no, I'm an attorney.
01:03:11 - mark sweet (3)
Like you're the only one that we able to do Colorado. Yeah, the same way we do like Washington right now.
01:03:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just saying cuz like somebody's already in New Mexico, but not you.
01:03:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So I'm asking Colorado is open for the Colorado's mark and mark AI.
01:03:26 - mark sweet (3)
Here we go. Yeah, no Colorado is we're trying to. haven't done anything with it yet. Um, although thing of it, the dude who was selling like coaching, he did like a really crappy job with Andy Stickel on the other dude. I don't remember who that is. Anyway, they connected with the guy in Colorado who just does a bunch of billboards, but doesn't want to actually work, and wants to spend all his time in Italy. So, yeah, maybe they'll be in part of connection there, but I don't know.
01:03:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, anything else?
01:04:00 - mark sweet (3)
Talk to Tom and the CAMG people about potentially doing boards into Mexico because that may not be the worst place to start and start getting like our message a little bit clearer and our feet under us to some level. That's just one thing we really haven't done much of any on is, you know, traditional.
01:04:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I would love to see the valiant breakdown by state.
01:04:31 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, it was actually kind of interesting. No Washington, despite generating a decent number of Washington leads in no California.
01:04:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, how much of New Mexico was him.
01:04:49 - mark sweet (3)
I'll tell you right now because he had asked him the same thing and to do the breakdown form. So that was for Missouri, five New Mexico for Washington. Sorry, no Arizona, that was not Washington, Arizona, that was weird.
01:05:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or Missouri, what?
01:05:10 - mark sweet (3)
Or Missouri, five New Mexico, Washington. But he generated a decent number of Arizona leads, just not an abandoned anything.
01:05:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where do the rest of the New Mexico ones come from?
01:05:26 - mark sweet (3)
Three came from Quantify. One came from Felipe, one came from Monkey, five from Valiant, three from Walker.
01:05:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was just asking because for the longest time in Mexico was averaging like two, and then we jumped up all of a sudden, just a few months ago to six, and now we've got thirteen. I mean, those retainers, that that trajectory is impressive.
01:05:56 - mark sweet (3)
It's quantifying Valiant, those are the two that really made the difference.
01:06:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
before quantifies Ben and quite frankly pretty good find thanks for mustache guy yeah like I said he never know so we're like him sort mustache guy yeah that's a case HQ but who found them case HQ on case HQ no case HQ came from case connect guys yeah and then case HQ referred quantified and who did case connection guys come from me that was the pedigree before it was me yes okay okay it was me for being on Facebook sort of case Nick was an absolute monetary failure for us that's okay they saw
01:07:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you have to look at the pedigree, you have to look at the little chart there, it matters, cause and effects, everything.
01:07:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, I mean, that is good point, right? It's like, some, right, it's not a fail, it wasn't a, it was a lesson, right? wasn't a failure in one respect, but then it's like led to this and led to this.
01:07:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It had a return, even if the return was indirect.
01:07:25 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, and then other people won't do it, right? That's like, that's what the ads are dealing with right now. All these firms they call, they're like, please stop calling me.
01:07:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, yeah, I'll bet. Also, this goes into the practice, which we intentionally and purposely have, which is exploring all the vendors. right. Yeah, exactly. that they're going to be crap and knowing that even if they are crap, sometimes there's a tangent that is valuable to us and, but look at, I mean, record number, When we started your low 30s, mid 30s, and now you're here, and one of the practices is exploring all the vendors, having all the conversations, and it is tedious, and it is risky, and some of them don't pan out. But because of the relationships in those conversations, and the secondary and tertiary conversations that happen as a result of the first one, look at where you're at now, all these different sources, just the change in power and who's bringing what across the state, it's just, I just want to pay attention to the practices and the value of that, because it's important.
01:08:43 - mark sweet (3)
So monkeys back to where it shouldn't be, because they did concerned over last month, obviously, because the numbers didn't make sense.
01:08:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Also, I feel like you leave You you manage the vendors better. I feel like you were a little bit more reactive before you didn't know your numbers, you weren't on top of them and you were hesitant to want to have conversations with them. I think you felt like they had a little bit more power over you than the other way around the dynamic has shifted and all of that has happened mostly. Here's the thing. The other thing about data that people don't really notice is that it creates a level of confidence in you know what you know. And so you do what you do even better, and that adds to more confidence and it's a compounding effect too but when you negotiate with people confidently their outcome is very different. So, anyway, all of that just takes into account. So, just wanted to point it out.
01:09:52 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, I just got to repeat it and beat it. think we're tenors out for next month already so that's good.
01:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good September. I can.
01:10:00 - mark sweet (3)
That's all right. Yeah. Well, I dropped for it. That's fine. So we'll repeat it again, which is good. And then starting soon, have Yuri. He's a lot of Thark joining us. So he's a Ukrainian Lot Thark dude and he's going to be taking the bar in February.
01:10:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And where's he going to fit?
01:10:23 - mark sweet (3)
So when he starts, we just have him do demands because I think it's going to start getting too busy. can do more as a demands. A lot of us quit with his to help Lorenz. He has a very large support system, but we're trying to see if can create another Patrick for lack of a better term where hey, this is kind of good. And you know, short term rental, I guess is the best way to think about it. You get a chance to see the lawyer be it be like in baseball, right? like, oh, it's a mid season pick up, but then like they're down the end of the season. We like to do not like anything. And so if he's a great film another Patrick, he's not great. We'll just say, hey, know, our perfect time done.
01:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Goodbye. I love that.
01:11:02 - mark sweet (3)
I love that as a problem process to build them up. this is a long term commitment, but but it's not with no without anything because he's doing some work.
01:11:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and it's the and also that's easier than going out and just trying to hire anybody because that doesn't go well.
01:11:23 - mark sweet (3)
We're having much more difficult time with it. So it makes more sense to build these people internally or I'll do both quite frankly, where we can find them. We just have to keep an eye on our payroll because that's a lot.
01:11:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is the guy who just like keeps throwing out bonus and left and right.
01:11:40 - mark sweet (3)
That's Mary more than me, but yeah.
01:11:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, okay. Well, Mary.
01:11:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think we need to start having some other conversations.
01:11:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Mary's nickname is money fairy.
01:11:51 - mark sweet (3)
Maybe you didn't know this. Look, we started. That's what I was going to say. You know, if the teams have their goals. to help them do more than push them and do more. So, you know, hey, and those are high numbers. think maybe.
01:12:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
But here's the question. Here's the real question. Are these numbers a result of that or not? Because you're for sure related. But right.
01:12:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
to what degree?
01:12:26 - mark sweet (3)
Right. I think what's going to be more on the money in than on the settlements themselves because the teams while they do have some controller getting, you know, records and whatnot. I'm sure they feel more like the attorneys are responsible for that. On the money in, you know, maybe something like the teams like the case manager is sitting around like, how close are we, how close are we to see what else they can push to try to get that extra money in.
01:12:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's the thing though. It's the amount that will make the biggest impact to you that actually almost makes the least impact to them. So psychologically. If there is a bonus for a thing, it's not necessarily that that bonus has to be a certain number. It just has to be there There's a potential that you're overpaying. So like on the line item for how you can earn the money Taking that back not necessarily you can't take anything back. Anyway, this is a whole big long conversation But my point is is that a lot of times a five dollar Not talking about your attorney your your your attorneys your team But it's somebody just getting an unexpected or an earned extra a small amount Versus a large amount that the happiness level is almost equal. They're obviously our gaps, right? But my point is that To get the lift that you need you probably don't have to give the lifts that you're giving so There is some math to be figured out there, but again you have an existing team Zisting expectations pulling back and then you have have to look at what's available in the market. There's a lot of numbers to crunch.
01:14:04 - mark sweet (3)
And that's probably what it comes to the market, where we can do these interviews, what people want, is more than what we're paying our current people for lower quality.
01:14:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:14:14 - mark sweet (3)
So this is the way to bridge that gap to some level.
01:14:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's entirely possible that it's a very, very good system. And so then the other way to leverage your money is to be able to use things like the AI to have them doing less of the tedious stuff. So they're doing more of the money-making activities. So with the same amount of staff, you're getting more money. You're also paying more bonuses. But that still should be maybe it's not a higher percentage of profit margins, but an overall higher bottom line. Then you're still winning the game.
01:14:51 - mark sweet (3)
So I think that's issue for me. is that I wanted an achievable because I hated, hated, hated working for people where the goal is just not realistic.
01:15:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. You feel like you're being set up to fail?
01:15:09 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. But I think it may actually be a little low because I shouldn't be breaking even every month if they hit their goal.
01:15:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Like that's not right.
01:15:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Exactly. So what kind of How can we visually see this data of what comes in and I have to think about, you know, what I would want to see, but all the different types of bonuses, what all the goals are, who hits them, how they hit them, what it costs you, aside from the bonuses is, you know, the working net revenue up until payroll and bonuses so that we can see that correlation and and look at the performance over time.
01:16:03 - mark sweet (3)
I can't, I'm kind of fried right now, but the most person they got and go through, but you know, again, these are good problems to have right in their goals and in their expectations.
01:16:13 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That's definitely not a bad thing. Oh, I got something. I talked to your boy, Salco. I forget when, but I forget when, but because I didn't answer the phone for a couple days, because I was doing a bunch of with my parents, but uh, so he was saying, and I thought this was interesting because I was like, okay, yeah, I never thought about that. He was saying how he just settled a dog bite through you or whatever, in your, in your firm, I think, for like 75 grand. He's like, yeah, just settled a dog bite for 75 grand. And I was like, okay. And he's like, can any of these vendors generate dog bite leads? And I was like, I don't know, like I never, I've never done it. I've never asked them. I've also never seen it. So I, when I I was talking to Ed, certainly, on my bi-weekly call that I have with them, for whatever reason. I brought it up with them, and the guy was like, really? I go, And he goes, I've never seen anybody do that. go, neither have I. So then he starts researching. He goes, dude, there's nine million dog mike. And he just starts rattling off all the data. And I go, And he's like, why doesn't anybody do this? go, I don't know. I go because lawyers, copy lawyers, copy lawyers. And I go, do you think you could generate them? He goes, yeah. And so when I was talking to South, I go, what's the criteria? And he goes, I mean, you know, that route lost some . And what I heard was, did you get bit a dog? Do you know who the homeowner is? Did you get medical assistance? Medical treatment. That's it. That's it. That's a lead. So I was like, yeah, that would be a lead. Oh, okay. That's a simple form, right? They just fill that out. So then it just becomes a math problem. What's the cost per lead? So if you say, cost per unit is x, convergent is five, right? We always know it's five from internet, basically. Then, and then average case value, you might not have enough data for that. But I go, okay, that's interesting. Like you could do that, but now you're talking about diversifying your case load, right? So everyone's going out to car accidents. You add this into the mix. got it. Now, hold on. You got car accidents and dog bites. Then you're also adding into the mix. Well, now they've had a lawyer with suite law. And when they get, when they get in a car accident, they're going to call a suite. Yep, and the referrals. So now all of sudden you're adding new nodes to your network. I was like, okay, that's interesting. And then it's a different demand, right? So it's like, okay, do you have a good dog bite demand? Sounds like Salko maybe had a good one. have no idea. But I was like, okay, that's interesting. And these guys were like, I can't find one. ad for this. That's it. I can't explain it to you, but I've never done it. Doesn't mean you should.
01:19:07 - mark sweet (3)
One really big difference between a couple between dog biting car accident.
01:19:12 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:19:13 - mark sweet (3)
The drop rate is massively higher on dog bite because a lot of people don't have insurance.
01:19:21 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. Exactly. So the qualifier, so the 5% might be too in actuality, right?
01:19:29 - mark sweet (3)
So if you if you bake it in a 50% drop rate, you get into the case because that's what I'm saying. So your drop rate is 40% plus.
01:19:38 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So if you model it at 50, can you even model it out, right? So if you say, okay, going to get, you're going to get, it's $250 a lead, you're going to convert five, and then, and then half of those are going to drop. They probably going to be cheaper, right? Yeah. So I was like, all right. And so the ads certainly guys are looking at it. They're like, wait. this is a thing. I go, it is a thing. I just don't know if it's a thing that works. And they're like, all right, this is interesting.
01:20:10 - mark sweet (3)
And of course, for them, talk about you get decent money on, especially when you talk about minor children getting bit, like we've gotten.
01:20:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That's the other thing, it's mostly children that get bit just to do sports a lot. No, according to the stats, I don't know if it's truly true.
01:20:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We have a little girl that lives up the street. She got mauled so bad. She doesn't have hair anymore because they she got attacked by two governments and they they chewed up her scout like she shouldn't be alive. She had multiple surgeries.
01:20:43 - mark sweet (3)
It was right. And so if there's insurance on the homeowner, that's, you know, $500 million case.
01:20:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yep.
01:20:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
01:20:52 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
They got nothing. So those get so you're not totally against this idea, then?
01:20:57 - mark sweet (3)
I'm not totally against the idea because be significantly cheaper for a commitment.
01:21:03 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I would imagine.
01:21:04 - mark sweet (3)
So yeah, exactly. But I'm not against the idea because the criteria is, did you get that yes, and then get scarring photos, basically, would like show me the bite because you've got people that it's like, you know, a scratch, like it's what I got. Oh, there you go.
01:21:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:21:18 - mark sweet (3)
But dog bites, especially California, it's there's no one bike for you. think Arizona law is a little different.
01:21:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Did you just say one bite free?
01:21:27 - mark sweet (3)
So Arizona kind of has that role, actually.
01:21:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
You're kidding. You had to have to be a second offense, like second strike.
01:21:35 - mark sweet (3)
Unless, you know, a dog with dangerous propensity. Yeah. wow.
01:21:40 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. And they were like, we could do California. OK, that would actually be the perfect and biggest population, all that good stuff, man.
01:21:49 - mark sweet (3)
Because you got some plastic assertions and stuff like that.
01:21:51 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So California would definitely be.
01:21:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. yeah.
01:21:55 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
01:21:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah. Well, I think the other thing is the system, whatever system. some you create like a could do you have access to or would a private investigator or if you hire them have access to like if you get they say yes I know the homeowner this is where they live this is their information where they could go say we know that they have insurance is it a record that a specific entity would have access to no you can hire a investigation companies it just but they're not the best in that regard I mean you send letters the worst case you file lawsuit and discover you find out pretty quickly and you just learn they have nothing and it's kind of a whatever but so if you wrote it all up it's basically here's the boxes this is what has to happen this is this is how long this would take this is what this process would look like so that and then do a rough forecasted like if we were able to get leads at this cost the percentage that have insurance, don't have insurance, the estimated value like I just did a quick search and it says 4.5 million people have been a Forbes report for last year, per year, 800,000 only must seek medical attention of those. Do they know, you know, how much is that is just little stitches or go away? There's nothing like there's so much data to go get and then plug in those numbers and then how much does it take? But even if it added, you know, $50,000,,000 to your gross revenue, that revenue, whatever, all those numbers, you could spend a day or two doing the research and find out if it's even viable, but if it's viable and you've got...
01:23:45 - mark sweet (3)
It's It's viable. Generally, also need to try to target more affluent areas.
01:23:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You don't want to target like combat. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:23:54 - mark sweet (3)
That's the big difference for the lead generation.
01:23:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They usually just do state wide and if you live or die by it's an area.
01:24:00 - mark sweet (3)
is where you just, you know, damn well, they don't have anything.
01:24:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:24:04 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So you're not targeting Compton. I got you're in Compton.
01:24:07 - mark sweet (3)
You're going to target more like Vermont.
01:24:09 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:24:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, okay. Um, else that needs to be talked about this week or tabled for brought up for next week to talk about?
01:24:23 - mark sweet (3)
You know, I mean, I buy things definitely in Avenue. Um, because it's easy to train. like, did you get bit by dog? Yes. Okay. You theoretically have a case like it's not.
01:24:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's also it's another way that you're using your existing resources. So it's getting more out of what you have. And that is leverage. Yeah. That's what we want more of that. Okay.
01:24:46 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. That's a back then.
01:24:55 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
But yeah. Oh, yeah.
01:24:57 - mark sweet (3)
I know. Yeah. That's coming. Yeah. Just as a quick heads up. that's one word for it.
01:25:05 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Um, but yeah, he died when, like today. Yeah. Yeah. That's what him and I were talking about that. He's like, he was like, I don't understand like what he thinks is going on. Like he's kept saying his dad thinks he's going to be doing this and doing that. I was like, dude, nobody, nobody, like, we're all on the same path. We're all on a path to the end. Of course, we're not sitting there going hope it ends.
01:25:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My mom is.
01:25:39 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, is true. And they and they accelerate that for them.
01:25:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know.
01:25:47 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, not recommended.
01:25:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not recommended. They're miserable. And they spread them as a read.
01:25:54 - mark sweet (3)
But you had something. All right. We're situation.
01:25:59 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, for sure.
01:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right guys, till next week.

I'm doing great.
00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you doing? I'm good. Time like flies. feels like forever. And also yesterday that I talked to you. Like, it's always the weirdest thing to me that time just is like that.
00:00:18 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The summer going fast for the kids.
00:00:21 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh, yeah. Madeline a lake day tomorrow.
00:00:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. We always go to the beach.
00:00:34 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Pontune. Pontune? Yeah.
00:00:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And so we always go to the beach at the end. And we used to rent a boat on the lake several times, but our lake has been volcanic, I think. So there's a volcano nearby. There is lava rock all around, but it's so purec right now and the fish are dead and the lake is hot. So that map to me is as I'm not going there.
00:01:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So. Wow. Yeah. Let's say that's a new, a new one. It's a new thing to deal with volcanic.
00:01:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not for my area. I mean, because we've got Mount Rainier, Mount St. Helens, Shasta, all, you know, is Shasta is visible to me. And then the mountain by this lake is called Mount McLaughlin. So yeah, we're in the Ring of Fire.
00:01:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's right. And Mount Hood too, right?
00:01:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:01:35 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:01:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. My brother has gone snowboarding there many times. Yeah.
00:01:40 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. That was where I skied for the first time. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
00:01:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How long ago was that?
00:01:47 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh, God.
00:01:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was in college.
00:01:50 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:01:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like 99 or something.
00:01:53 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Hanging out in Oregon. Yeah. Had a buddy who moved out there. Wow. his wife and before they had a kid. No. No, they had a baby and I went and stayed with them for a week and Took me skiing, which I didn't know how to do and it was all ice So yeah, I made a I mean one run where I didn't fall Yeah, it's not as easy as it looks Now there is this business where do you own but you're kind of killing it right now Yeah, um I'm really like accepting or accepting is that the worry. Yeah, excepting we'll go with it like Getting comfortable with the idea of like Like what I like I'm good at writing. I Can I can go in to? know a legit business and I can make an impact with What I do with copywriting and I was just thinking like I always had this mentality growing up of like you know, go get a job, go work. And I was like, working is just what I know how to do. And so I, you know, I'm looking at the stuff I'm doing with Tim and the Jim and getting five grand there. And then I've got another potential client in the, that I mentioned in the conservative political space that I think it'd be a lot of fun to work with. And they're interested in meeting with me. I know them really well through Brian. So, you know, I have no idea what that budget is, but whatever if it's not them, I feel like, well, somebody else I could find to do another five grand a month. And I was just thinking like, you know, I kind of like just going in, having a really defined scope of what I'm doing, focusing on that, and getting paid, you know, feels like a really attainable at least for now, like, putting together, like, like being the face of a product, or putting something out there that I'm, that I'm selling, for, at this point, in my life, like, I feel, I feel really just comfortable selling other other people's stuff for them, like, I'll admit, like, I probably have a, a block on selling. My own stuff, especially if I'm the face of it, and I'm open to moving past that, but at the same time it's like this other skill set of just doing copywriting for people can make me get money and I enjoy it. And yeah, the idea that I was thinking, the term was like, I know how to work like a blue collar person, and you know, because that's what I grew up around, and I was like, what if I just start taking more of that mentality, like an elevated blue collar type of approach where I go and I'm a workhorse, I can still set my hours, I work, you know, five or six hours a day, and it's a manageable schedule, I still set my own hours, and So, yeah, I'm just kind of like, that feels like in the strike zone for me, um, no.
00:06:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have a hard stop at 1230 or whatever time it is for you to 30?
00:06:16 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
No, it's, no, it's 142 for me. I've got to take my dogs to the groomers at three. So, I've got, I've got like an hour. Okay.

I just want to make sure that we can go through everything, but I just want to maybe think about the language a little bit because all, all words have connotations to them. Yeah. One with blue collar is kind of grunt worker and low value. Yeah. It depends on who you're talking to, right? Amongst the blue collar people, they're like, you know, I'm innocent to work early. you know, and anybody that pays attention to the economy knows that there's a shortage of laborers, skilled laborers. But you're, so there's a couple of things to it. One is that you just, you get things done. So what I would say, and again, there's so many parallels with us in how you serve and how I serve. What I've been called, I think before I even called myself that, then it was Ryan Maran pointed it out, and it's driving. I'm a driver. get things done. I can be driving myself, driving the project, but it's the energy and the momentum behind that word, but it connotation to it.
00:07:56 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Do you know what I mean?
00:07:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. The other thing that, And I think that this is something we could probably start to help you put some meat on and create a framework, which is something I never really did well because I really kind of custom tailored around people. But now that I've been doing it for so long, I realize that there is a plan, there is a strategy like semi modules. For example, to give you is I've got principles and priorities, know, I have to go even look them up. That's how I know what they are and we go through them, but thinking about them chronologically. So principles and priorities, and then it goes into finances, and then it goes to time tracking, and then we go into project management, and then we go into teams. And then we go into hiring teams, and then it's sharp in your saw and kind of mindset and things like that. And then it's iterative, constantly, right? But the reason we kind of start there is because principles informally, priority, priority informs what gets done. And the reason we go to our finances next is because finances let you know what you need to be gunning for, what you can do, what you can't do. Then we get into time because money had to dictate what our resources are before we even think about how we spend our time. But also priorities had to be dictated before we could even think about our times, you know what I mean? So then we get into project management. Okay, now we know what's important to us, we know what we can afford, we know what we need to set as a target so that we can get to the team that we want to work on. And now we know where we're going to spend our time, let's structure it, let's get it into a project management suite. Okay, now that we've got that, who are we hiring, what's our dream team? And it could just be one person that we're starting anyway, but I do kind of have a systematic approach now. Not everybody is at the same place in that conversation has nuance of. looks a little different but really it's not and the reason that it looks different is because of values and priorities and things like that so budgets you know and things like working in front of the screen working behind the scene kind of thing you know things like what's your conversion right right how many eyeballs you're getting on your offer what is your offer how big is your audience list how many offers have you even made to them how long have they been sitting there not getting an offer um you know did you did you just give them one offer and it was way up here did you try down here did you ascend them like there's a whole lot of things that can happen kind of chronologically and so you go through that going oh you missed this spot let's come back here you missed this you know what i mean or you did this but it was we don't have clear data we have data but it wasn't well or you made this change since the last time you did this this. So systematically approaching all the things that you know how to do. Now, if you built that into a written down framework of these are all the things that I'm going to look at because you just do it automatically.
00:11:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's in your head.
00:11:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do the same things. But I haven't really up until now, which is what I'm working on. sat there and documented these are all the levers I'm always looking for in the business.
00:11:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I've been doing it in my head.
00:11:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many times that I tell you, Chris, get it out of your head. You need the document in it. So taking my own advice. But that's where your power is. So back to kind of blue collar.
00:11:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's not blue collar work.
00:11:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's power. And one of the other types of descriptions I've given is I'm a surgeon. I make surgical because I'm not going in there and like, you know, blowing everything up or I'm not pumping you full of drugs that are systemic, right? I'm going to the pain points. We are only going to fix the pain point. We're going to make the least. of damage to the body possible, right? So, and that's where, what is the word? Freedom and cash fastest path, the tip of the time, okay? Fastest path to cash and fastest path to freedom, where they intersect is where we make the most of money in the least amount of time, that's a precision cut. So, you kind of do the same thing because offers our precision cuts.
00:12:26 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:12:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We are not changing your whole business. We're not overhauling the website that you're on. We're not overhauling your tech stack. We're not overhauling your team. We're not overhauling the products that you've created. We're taking everything that you have as existing assets, if possible, and improving the offers made with the existing assets or looking for how can we repurpose the asset into, switch it, or what's a supplementary or complement. entry offer that you can make. From everything that you've ever done with Brian and everything I've seen you do for yourself and other people, those are the precision cuts that you make. So that offers, what I would love to do is just kind of go through your paragraphs section by section and kind of try to do that for you, right? Precision cuts, what can we do to improve that? I would like to talk mostly about your opportunities to make sure that because one thing I think that you can still have help with is you're an offer king except for when it comes to making your own offer as a consultant. What I would like you to do is pretend you are somebody else, okay? So you're not pitching yourself. No, like write it down and you can give him an avatar or something else if you need to mentally disconnect so that you don't. getting that ego thing. Yeah, like, I know everything about this guy. This is what he does. This is what he brings to the table. This is this business. This is how this guy is gonna just help it. And this is what it's worth. And now you're gonna make that pitch on behalf of him, which is you, right? be like, this, this is a no brainer. So if you don't have a brain and you don't So you go and look at the odds that I'm going to be able to get you a 5% lift. If I do this and you support me doing this, I mean, the odds are very small that that fails. You know, if you want to give a guarantee, you don't or in the guarantee could be, I'll say until I get that lift provided, you show up, you provide whatever you're supposed to provide that how confident I am. so I'm not going to give you a money back guarantee because that's my time. But I'll commit my time until we win because I see your stuff is that good, so I'm I'm believing in you and I'm not just asking you to believe in me, but that's how much I'm believing in your stuff is that I'll commit my time guaranteed until we get X results, right, right.
00:15:17 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
People are going to know that most people won't. Yeah, that that's a interesting mental exercise to create a software for for somebody else because I I was reading about people are doing these they call it they call it product highest services basically like design joy is the one who who really the first place I came across it is just a designer that that sells his design services for flat flat fees got a very like clear process before you buy, how it works, like, you know, I'm going to work on one thing for you at time. So that it's not like stacking up, like this is how we're going to work together type of thing. And it's like, you know, I think he's five grand a month. And then and then there are a got a list of other companies that are doing this similar model of productizing their services. I've got some copywriters who are doing that as well. And I was thinking about that around because the thing that I'm I think the thing that I'm best at is email copy. I do long form. I mean, I've written two sales letters for 10, like in really short, short order, one of them. did really well. other one, the offer wasn't as good. He's gonna end up doing a little over 10 grand on that one. But the first one, you know, he did 75 grand and that was a much stronger offer. And so yeah, I'm following what you're saying and I'm thinking about like a way to sell consulting services because I mean really like what I what I really want is to be at place where I'm investing the money that that comes in into cash flowing investments that that pay me you know eventually we'll be able to replace the income that I want to make. make. that's always been sort of what I've had in my mind of like, this is what I want to do. And the way that I've always tried to go about doing that is by trying to put myself in the role of, you know, a specific way to do business, like launching and releasing products. And which, you know, is not out of the realm of possibility for me, but just like right now in the near term, I'm, you know, Brian talks about, like, you got to follow the anecdotal evidence. And right now, the anecdotal evidence is, you know, doing these consulting gigs is bringing in cash. And so it's just got my mind thinking that maybe I need to rethink that whole The whole idea of consulting, whereas for so long, I've seen it as a time for money treadmill. But if I think in terms of a decade, like 10 years, if I were to do this for 10 years, I'm you know, after 10 years, like that's, how old is Grady? Grady's 13.
00:19:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How? How's he that old?
00:19:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:19:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's an eighth grade. Oh my gosh.
00:19:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
This year.
00:19:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, something just along those lines of what you're thinking about, and obviously everybody's different, but I find that my resistance to being out in front is shifting now that I'm getting
00:20:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
getting near the emptying nesting.
00:20:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I wonder how much of that was self-preservation was also family protection. There's a different amount of pressure, and also there's such a thing as internet famous. mean, going into a marketing conference and being recognized, that was a very long time. That was 11 years ago, 12 years ago. And I was barely online. And now, you know, the world is much smaller, and we get there faster with TikTok and YouTube. if you're going to create new content, it's going to go everywhere. So if you're a face, you're a face. And that brings a whole new level of theme that I think naturally, protectively, we don't want our families to deal with. And it does take focus away because we feel. extra level of responsibility to our fans, our audience, our customers, whatever. And they feel an entitlement to the people that they engage with like, where are you? What's going on? Like, that's a whole nother of emotional estimate that I think maybe we don't consciously think about as much as we subconsciously go. You have no, no, no needed, don't want it. And I think that we have both kind of observed that there tends to be a little bit of an ego thing that goes on with a lot of people that are faces that maybe we're trying to protect ourselves against not wanting to be that person. And that, but that has a correlation to the same thing with money. Like, when you don't have money, you tell yourself that having money is bad. And that you don't want to do it because you'll be bad. but money doesn't change people. just amplifies what they are and they get, you know, they reveal it faster. So, Anyway, the thing about the 10 years thing, Grady will be grown, Madeleine will be grown, and into college, that's a whole exit runway there, giving you guys time to, because of course you could always shorten that if you wanted to, with that plan, you're now getting them set up in new houses, going to college, that stuff's expensive, and they in a different kind of way, like really being physically present when they're little, you know, they can go off and play for a little while, but now they're like, they know if you're paying attention to them, they know if you're really invested and available and all that stuff. So anyway, here's what I love about that plan for you. That's what I love about it, but the other thing is, it comes down to the boundaries, which is the conversation we've been having a lot, right? So you used to have a habit, which I think that you're very much getting out of, which is... If I'm here, I have to take care of everything because if I see a problem, I got to fix the problem and If I see the problem I'm accountable for the problem and it should probably come out of my own pocket And because I'm a partner or you know what I mean?
00:23:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Like you took a lot of things on you that didn't belong on you.
00:23:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, sure Yes, but not just Brian. It happened in it with the lease stuff. Um, I think it happened with I want to say Tim It it one of your first consulting jobs.
00:23:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom.
00:23:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, um, yeah because I I You are prone to feel a sense of obligation to something that isn't yours and I think partly out of fear of Maybe just just because you saw it. Maybe it's just because you saw it. So you feel accountable for it Side to comprehend the value and know that you're there to help. And so I think I'm the one that has to help with everything. Anyway, I think that that's what really bogged you down the most is because you can't do all of that. You were getting paid to do all of that. And now because you've created two things, really powerful things that I don't think really existed for you before, like when we first met with Brian and anything since, until around this year, last, last whole year, not just calendar year, and that is boundaries and leverage. So a very more defined scope of support that you both expressed and kept to that that's the important part kept to you. And then the leverage was in that scope of support that also it was that I'm doing this thing specifically. That's all I'm doing. This is the power of it. this is the value of it, this is what it's supposed to bring to the table for you, for me, that like you and the business and your partners. And so, as long as you not only keep doing that but improve that, if you continue to optimize that, your capacity to consult and have an impact and continue to be paid, the other factor is that lever is only as powerful as the way it can lift and the reward it can bring. So, if the person you're working for right now that you did those sales letters, the gym, I can't think of this, that's Tim. And Tom 10, that's how I get it. impact was able to be made because of his resources, because of his instruction. So you were able to plug into something powerful. So that's the other thing is, If you're going to try to help somebody that has almost nothing as a business, it doesn't matter how powerful your step is, they don't have powerful stuff to plug into, know, a 2% increase to $200, 2% increase to $2 million is, you know what I mean? So if you take all of those things into account when you are making those offers, you know, the leverage power, the reward, and also the risk for the drain and everything, that gets mitigated and the reward gets maximized. Yeah, probably all the things you're already thinking about, but I just want to add the support to it and say yes to it.
00:26:43 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I mean, I think like I'm comfortable now with like the idea of like my minimum is, you know, at least 5 grand a month, so that, and I get there, there are a lot of ways to get But for me, I get there just mentally of like, I'm involved in, you know, a couple other things. so if I'm going to take my time to focus on something else, like it's got to be paying me this amount of money. And, and that'll serve as a, that'll serve as a nice filter for people too. But, yeah, I mean, I think, I think adding another consulting client in the other, the other unknown is with this, this tea thing. I spoke to, to Jim yesterday, and he owes me, I'll say he owes me an update by tomorrow. Apparently, the issue there is like, there's, They've got this Microsoft server that their pages are built on and the pages are not loading because of some server area, server error, so they've got this IT guy that they work with. So he's like, I'm going to get these pages up and loading this week and then I'm going to move everything over to Linux server, he's like I'm done with Microsoft. So I mean, it's a technical issue that I like that's more technical than I know what to do with when you're talking about server performance and issues.
00:28:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you said Microsoft server and I was like, what are pages, you've heard said pages, but now I'm thinking more like Windows NT or something like that. Anyway, totally irrelevant.
00:29:03 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Definitely out of Got it. Yeah. and that's, so I don't fully understand the issue, but I believe Jim, like I don't get the sense that, like he's, I don't get the sense like there's anything nefarious going on here, and it's not like they have any leverage to do anything anyway, but.
00:29:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What, now what does he do?
00:29:42 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
What's his business? So, Jim is John's son and.
00:29:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, oh, this, these are the tea. These are the tea.
00:29:53 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay. Okay.
00:29:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's something else in his business is having issues. Like, how does it, does this affect you or just says something keeping him busy?
00:30:05 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, it affects me in the sense of like these, these pages, these sales pages that John wrote. And I'm more or less copy chief, but John wrote the upsell pages. Because of whatever server issue is happening, like they're not, they're not loading. Um, so they're hosting? It, they keep using the word server. Um, it's, it sounds like, it sounds like a hosting issue.
00:30:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, okay, but, um, originally you had the T domain, you had all of that stack. Oh, well now it's on click bank, right? So can you give me the tech stack real quick? Just kind of like where it was before, where it is now, what changed?
00:30:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Um, the offer will be on click bank. So, clipping handles the payment processing, but the actual pages are your pages that you host on your own.
00:31:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you used to host your own staff, so he took over all of that now?
00:31:21 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, they, so they're not using any of the hosting that I had on the, for the tea before, because the way that we're selling the tea is, is with an existing offer that they have on, on click bank, and it's, it's called a new, new body, it's a, it's like a health and wellness fitness offer for people, loose fat, build muscle like anything, because that's John's back. ground. And so the upsell for the T is going to be shown to those buyers initially to solve the traffic issue of not having to go out and build an ad campaign to start so we can get cash flowing in that then we can reinvest back into coal traffic and that type of thing. So the click bank is handling the payment processing and then I guess the pages, the pages are not loading or they're not floating quickly enough for whatever technical reason is going on with this, they keep using the word Microsoft server. So maybe it's a server inside their hosting. I don't know what they're using.
00:33:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, or the other way around hosting on a server because every site that we have is on a server somewhere.
00:33:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right, right. So. Okay, then the. So those are the main two pieces attack the clipping payment processing in their hosting slash server that are in place and there's an issue with the hosting server. then after after the purchase happens, we're using ship station to handle the fulfillment. to, uh, to the folks up in, in Rochester.
00:34:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, just to adjust an upsell to their stuff. Mm hmm. Okay.
00:34:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. I'm click bank and they, and they have, um, you know, five to 7,000 people come through that funnel every month. So it's a, it's a good. Um, you know, it's not a huge, but it's a decent stream of traffic to put this offer in front of, and, uh, for the purposes of testing and acquiring customers, you know.
00:34:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, it depends on how much you want to be involved in, and what you want to know because your bottlenecked by this. It's not your primary business. Um, I were going to be involved at all, I would want I know, where is it hosted? Why are you using, like, is this a personal server? Is this, I mean, because there are, you know, mom and pop shop servers and hosting services. And, but you didn't specify that in a contract. And any of that type of stuff, and it behooves them to get their stuff figured out, but maybe just asking questions and making sure they're not operating in dinosaur ways, they've got optimized. And having a, you know, not a, I'm demanding things, but let's have a talk and see if you can do some better things, choose a better hosting provider, whatever, I don't know. But yeah, I mean, server issues are real, especially when you're not using a streamlined one that has a huge team that has lots of different servers that you can go to.
00:35:58 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Well, I mean, I spoke to him yesterday, spoke to Jim yesterday and, you know, I mean, I could tell he's in it like he sounded just like just done with the whole thing and ready to to move and get it fixed. he he promised me an update by Thursday, by tomorrow, and I'll I'll text him if I don't want hear from him. You know, I I just have been, I've kind of given a longer leash to them, I guess.
00:36:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
pacing comes in because there's just something you can't predict. and there was a big learning curve and then it's that's where priority comes into because if this isn't your bread and butter yeah but you got this existing asset and your priority was don't lose the asset but don't be buried by it don't have to do the marketing basically you tap into my existing resources and I get paid there's no reason not to let it take a pace that is chill as long as you can tell it's being moved along stuff is getting done maybe it's not the way you would have wanted to but 80-20 is you're barely touching it it should still end up paying you you just have to get set up but the advising you know I don't know how old they are but if you're dealing with a man and his grown son it's been around for a while probably little bit up there um yeah yeah and also I think yeah John's in his 60s and Jim is like early
00:38:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
really for you. So he's, he's around my age and, you know, they, uh, Jim is like his, um, his operations person basically. So he works with his dad on his office. Hey, who's dad?
00:38:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who's son?
00:38:21 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Uh, John, John is the dad.
00:38:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Jim is the son.
00:38:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, it's definitely moving, uh, slower than I expected, but I also, I do, I do feel like it's going to get solved here real soon. Like I talked to him yesterday about, you know, I'd really like to get this off for a live next month. Uh, do you have to knew anything? Is, well, I, I purchased, um, bunch of tea for inventory. So, you know, that's a cost I've already made and invested in, and I brought that up like 10 days ago to them when reached out, like, let's get a timeline, like, I've done so much I've invested, and that really got their attention and a lot of apologies and that kind of thing.
00:39:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are costs split, do they have to pay for half of that also?
00:39:37 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
They don't have any cash, so I took that on and I get, like, all the profit goes to pay me back off the top from the first sales.
00:39:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A couple more things real quick. Can you, so something to maybe think about is use this as an exclusive offer. Hey, we had some tech issues and we just bought inventory, so we got to move this stuff to make sure whatever. Use that because that's real. Tap into that, maybe offer a special discount, but maybe it's not really like it's the price is built into it. So it's framed that way. Maybe ask them to email offer a little bit more aggressively than they would.
00:40:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's a potential thing.
00:40:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or if that tea goes bad and it doesn't get used, it comes out of their cuts when the money does come. Just some things to think about.
00:40:45 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Yeah, mean, we we all went into like in when I agreed to. To make that investment in John was up front from the very beginning from the very first call of like. He doesn't have any money to put into this, and he's had some financial struggles. Well, that's another reason to double check on the server issue, because maybe he's cutting corners, he shouldn't be cutting and being foresighted about it. That's true.
00:41:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because especially with an older school guy, that's possible. So, you know, and that's kind of affect you, something to think about.
00:41:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, for sure.
00:41:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think it figured out there's a huge dynamic difference, though, between that and how you started with other people, especially an older gentleman, that, you know, the dynamic should be your ultimately the boss. And it started with, you know, I want this 33, no.
00:41:54 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I've got 50, they each have 25.
00:41:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's probably not really anything else to talk about that particular thing, right?
00:42:11 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I don't think so. It's just moving slowly and about connected with Jim tomorrow to get an update.
00:42:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll let you go. So with this guy working with the lead company in political conservative space, that, did we talk about that? Was that part of the, you were talking about a consulting job and making an offer? And was that what you were referencing?
00:42:45 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, this is, the company is American Target advertising. Been around for decades. Found a by guy named Richard Bigory who back in the. late 60s like he's an older dude and he is like he invented like a new category of political fundraising and that's back in the late 60s raising money for Nixon and people like that and and it's it's really kind of burst a lot of the way that political fundraising is is done today I know him through through Brian because he was in Brian's the mastermind and his right hand is a lady named Kathleen Patton who I know really well but they they recently hired a like a director of digital marketing or something like that and she her name's Marcy she's in she went through the over-delivered boot camp And that we just finished yesterday. And I just heard her mention on a call that they were gonna be hiring, looking to hire an email, a copywriter. So I just sent her an email. was like, hey, I heard you say this, are you looking for full time, time? She said, part time. So I just said, I just basically told her I'd love to put my hat in the ring, told her I knew all the people she knows. And also just shared like, I do personally feel compelled to, like I do want the Republicans to win in November. And I want to, I would love to make a contribution to that. And that's all genuine and legit. shared that with her. Cause that's stuff I usually don't share with anybody. Yeah. so in Kathleen and I have talked politics a whole lot, and so I center a whole bunch of writing samples of stuff that I've done, and they're going to reach out to schedule a call heard from her yesterday that they were going to be reviewing everything and getting it to me.
00:45:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a few things I want to point out. Think about, ask about whatever. Yeah. Number one, it's while, but we talked about the power of network and how feeding that and nurturing that brings things around when, whether it be political and having those types of allies, there's going to be a day where we're all going to have their band arms one way or another. First, we physically, whatever it's going to happen, who we know, and the the level of relationships we have when that happens for people, whether it's large scale or small community scale, something is inevitable. Some type of civil upheaval is gonna happen. So that's one thing. To just getting to have a contribution in the way things do, we have no right to complain about anything when we won't do what's in front of us, you know. So there's that, you having the agora experience, just having an awareness of how agora emails, how they market, things like that, and how that impacts politics, because there's definitely a lot of involving there, is useful and beneficial. one thing I would do is change the way you ask the question about it and frame it. And now I'll take you back to blue collar worker full time of hard time, irrelevant surgeon. What are the results that you want? What are the results that you're looking for? Now we're talking about value, but when you say full-time part-time, you're automatically putting yourself in an hourly type position, evaluating your value per hour. You don't want that ever. You want to be evaluated based on your results. So we have an existing email list, we bring about $x in sales, we're looking to make this list. This is how often we email. This is our attrition rate on the email list. Like get data, don't ask about full-time part-time, just ask about what is your current email situation.
00:47:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Can I ask you some questions first?
00:47:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'd love to have a conversation with you about this. Email is something that I have a proven truck record of and making a significant lift in sales. Bye. multiples, you know, speaking in language like that, which, you know, people, people can use and use and they do, but that's true for you. And as you dig into it and ask the numbers, you can get that. But start positioning yourself immediately. Start leveraging the words and the conversation that you use immediately. You are not the hourly worker, you are not the employee, you are not the grunt worker, you are always consultants and experts, even if you're doing the labor.
00:48:37 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I take that point. I think my, my counter to that would be that this is not like a, I mean, small company in the sense of like, it doesn't have thousands of employees, but I know it's been around for a long time. It's kind of a corporate mentality. quality. And I will showcase all the things that you're talking about on a call with them. And at the same time, I know that if I feel like if I led with that with them, that it would be skipping, I'm trying to get my foot in the door. So I know they're thinking in terms of full-time or part-time. They say we want a full-time person. would have, I would know that like, well that I can't commit to that because what they're thinking is I want somebody 40 hours a week. so knowing that they're just looking for a part-time freelancer, that's helpful because I know that and what I said is like I'd love to have a conversation with you about what you're looking for and see if I can help. So I'm just trying to get the conversation in that conversation. Once I get it, then, you know, I can shift their understanding of what this is and what the potential is by the questions I asked. I take your point like I see what you're saying.
00:50:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I see what you're saying with the foot and the door. I still think that you may be reframing it in terms of what kind of volume are you looking for? Because that answers your full-time part-time and maybe they don't know it, which in and of itself is a signal because even if it's a good cause, you only have so much energy and time bandwidth. So if it's a poorly managed business or if the arrangement is not leveraged, even if it's a good cause, you might be signing up for or more than you really want to give and can give at this time so that's just something to think about not so and this goes back to you and it's been a while i don't know actually if you and i have ever talked about it but good better best i'm familiar with the concepts so the thing is you have finite yeses if you say yes to good things that's good if you say yes to great things that's great but here's the deal if you fill up with good and great you don't or good better best good and better you don't have room for best so you know do you want the best and and here's the other thing is sometimes we get these things that put something on our radar that never was on our radar before and sometimes that's all we needed so maybe it's all right this isn't really what I've got the bandwidth for right now but now I know I want to put my skills towards helping the Republicans win or or you know what I'm just going to volunteer this or I will do this which isn't everything you want but here's what I'll do here's the price that I'll charge you and here's why I think it's a no-brainer and you could take it or leave it but still put it inside of your terms don't worry about foot in the door because either they're going to vibe with your energy and the mission and the fact that you're not taking advantage of them but that you're also compartmentalizing and going okay but this is this is what I can this is the limit to what I can bring today um but then just and the other the other part of the pitch is but once I get inside and see what you're doing what I'll offer for free is a consultation for optimization and and just what I
00:53:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
see about improvement.
00:53:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you can find where in the conversation to have that or not have that. But remember that even in these things, when you want to get in your foot in the door, remember your level of expertise, that's all. And that there's finite time and energy.
00:53:22 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, for sure. Yeah, I see that.
00:53:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But then go chase the right thing that serves that purpose if you want it because it is an election year. And you do have major skills. So anyway, okay. You still have time.
00:53:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay.
00:53:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would really love to know about the boot camp, how that went.
00:53:47 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know, this is over the boot camp. This the only second time we've done it. I don't love it. Yeah. And it went only at 30. people sign up. so I was emailing with Brian yesterday because he was like, on the next boot camp, I want to add more of his ads to the slides and things like that because they're just basic slides. our response to him was like, yeah, we can do that. But I think the bigger challenge is like figuring out how to sell this. So because we had 60 people sign up on the first one. And, you know, like, if I, if I'm not the target market for the real, real boot camp, like if I had bought that and gone through it, I wouldn't be happy because it's, I mean, it's really kind of about principles. like Brian, Brian's thing is not teaching the, the nitty-gritty pretty stuff. Like he's big picture and he talks in terms of like, you know, like the closest to like a tactical thing he talks about is like when you're developing your first order, always have the second order in mind. And that's a helpful like concept that he can riff on. But that's like an example of like the most tactical that he gets. His wheelhouse is just not in really getting into things that you walk away and you're like, oh man, that's amazing. But at the same time, the reason I say I'm not the target market is because there are people in the boot camp who will say, wow, that was amazing. And they loved it.
00:55:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so, I mean, that's like listening to Socrates or Marcus Aurelius you know there's philosophy and some people's brains don't think like that and they haven't had those teachers so that value is huge because the tactics mean nothing if you don't understand the philosophy behind it and I'm with you I want tactics I'm full of philosophy you know but so segmentation first of all of the list and just kind of being able to figure out who is philosophical and who's tactile tactical and being able to serve them more because whoever's you know soaking up the philosophy more that serves a purpose and you can correlate a monetary benefit to that because it changes how you operate because it You know, like you said, principles, um, so, but, but if there's a person who's looking for tactics, that's going to be so annoying and frustrating because there's nothing super actionable or clearly defined. so, um, something to think about is, is there a way and it could be really short and you could use AI for this. So, have AI just go through all the transcripts and say pull out all the principles. Okay. um, do you have suggestions for tactics, for executing these principles inside of a business? Give an example for this type of business, this type of business, this size of business, this financial, you know, monetary thing type of business, and use it to put maybe a little bit more on it. So, um, And then maybe you can just sell that with what was there plus the outline and maybe some supplemental videos that you do as a not a live thing, but a prerecorded course. See what kind of feedback you get on it, maybe drive traffic just to that and not make it super expensive. But now you've captured all of your existing stuff, your repurposing and not doing good. This is what wasn't. Get some reviews on it. then if you only do a live one once or twice a year, then it gets more energy. You kind of bottleneck it so people have to build up and like look forward to it. And it's kind of a launch style instead, which I think would energize Brian. And you know, that's the whole kind of thing, which also reduces how many times you even have to think about doing it. It just starts like that.
00:59:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, the AI thing is a good idea to be able to see what opportunity might be there to make it a little more tactical because that also helps with selling it and being able to talk about what they're going to get. I was about this today during my workout, it's like for Titans, I'm both the visionary and the integrator and I see, like with Tim, like if I were to propose an idea to Tim, it's like hey, I'm going to do this bootcamp and it's going to, because Tim's got a book coming out, right? So, hey, we're going to do this bootcamp around your book. like, Tim would, would put the thing, an outline of the whole thing together. And, and we would get on a call and we would go through that and we would refine it. And Brian is not going to do that. So if anything is going to happen, it's going to be needed to create it. And so in my mind, I think like, well, break through advertising is one thing, because it's, it's an investment, like it's a brand that's going to outlive Brian. And I've created, so I'm motivated to like, to create around that brand.
01:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's tactical by design.
01:00:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
And it's tactical. Yeah. to liver. You know, that's, that's going to be a, that's not our brand beyond Brian and, and he's, it's, I just always felt like I'm pulling Brian. to, you know, whatever you want to call success after his career in boardroom. And he would tell you that too. So, there's a little bit of a, I feel like I want to protect my time with the over-delivered boot camp of like, in and knock this thing out of the park.
01:01:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you get any conversions yet?
01:01:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, yeah. We've added four people into TXL from the 38. The deadline is Sunday. I think we'll probably end up with 15. So, like, that right there is, that's my motivation is like, okay, if this is a good way to get people into TXL.
01:01:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, let's put a number on that. Yeah. you. Let's say you got. 15 people in.
01:02:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
What does that work to you? Uh, 15 people, you know, tell you. Uh, people.
01:02:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Calculate it right in front of you if you want it.
01:02:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
What's that?
01:02:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
there's a calculator right in front of you if you want it on that computer.
01:02:19 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I'm doing it right now.
01:02:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got my calculator up. My brain would go, uh, I can't do math on the band when somebody's looking at me.
01:02:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So that, if we get 15, that's, uh, 5,400 to me.
01:02:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now roughly how much time do you think it spends on it?
01:02:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Uh, the, the, uh, there were six calls, hour and a half.
01:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Include promotions and anything else.
01:02:56 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, this time I just, I just ran the same email. We did on the first one.
01:03:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:03:02 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I didn't rewrite those. I mean, I want to have calls six of them, so six times. So nine, nine hours for the calls and probably another five hours.
01:03:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Want to know that hourly rate roughly? Three hundred and eighty five dollars an hour.
01:03:31 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
01:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, for everything else that I know that you do, I don't think that you average a lot higher than that. Even with your consulting.
01:03:42 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right.
01:03:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So now the other thing is how much you enjoy the time and how tedious it is and that type of thing. Now that's a big factor. And if you can do things that you enjoy more for roughly the equivalent, you know. amount of time so but that's another reason too and and because you know Ryan has help issues that come up that sometimes things have to get rescheduled he's definitely got a lot of things that that can that come up every year there's something he just had another surgery on his heart oh last month lesson so anyway so taking that and figuring out what you can do to optimize it and then making it an evergreen just pre-recording thing and then if you want to having maybe it's once a year over delivered bootcamp and you pre-sell you know and it's like embedded into everything else like at the bottom of the email p s p s that type of thing offering everything hey we're doing this later and then closer to it do a ramp up advertising thing and now that changes everything the energy should be really hot You can have the tactics, can have all the pretty graphics that make Brian excited about it and really make it a big production, which helps with the brand, which I think matters to Brian. And it's over delivering like it's built to over deliver. He can have other gifts like because you guys can kind of, if you're pre selling it and people are buying it. And you can tell him like if you can't make it live, here's the recordings and you get all of these bonuses. Plus here's the best action bonuses if you sign up between this month and this month because we're going to build up for a whole year, that kind of thing. You can really make it a production that helps him feel like he's keeping his brand live and he's feeding his brand. This isn't Jean's stuff, this is his. And so it's kind of an homage. It mitigizes how much work you put into it. You get to build the engine which you love to do, right? engine is the thing. The demo comes duplicatable. for be a bootcamp if you wanted to do it so you can have be a live versus not but since we know that that really is where most of accelerator members come from and they got to play with that a little bit but anyway you are primed to optimize all of this for multiple reasons brian's health yeah um you're you're just simply doing this everywhere and you've got other options so you don't have to be you know he he doesn't have you over a barrel so to speak you know um there's there's so much that's evolved and on top of that AI can really help take existing content that you've gotten over and over again and go what are the best parts of this and really give you some some tools so that even if you're doing it yourself you're not really you know what i mean i get chatgbt4o changed everything
01:07:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know, actually, I think what I would do, because I'm pretty sure, can't you, you can upload videos into chat GPT. I haven't done it yet.
01:07:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've taken video transcripts, but I wouldn't be surprised if you can now.
01:07:15 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you can't, if not, can get a transcript of it, but I think I would take the recordings from this bootcamp and say, listen to this lesson. And, and they help me come up with, you know, specific tactics that, that would go along with it. That I think would be, because when I think about over-delivered, because I've read the book and it's like, like, it, it just, it's, it requires, for me, just a lot of mental energy, like, to make the connection from the philosophical to, like, how do we make this real?
01:07:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you know what else you could do? Is you could build a couple of avatars Say so chat tpt first of all here's all kinds of my Kent called content. Here's my call recordings Here are things that I've written okay learn me First of all profile me. What do you know about me? Okay? me tell you some other things about how I feel about business what annoys me what I like when I'm looking for help This is what I'm looking for here We're gonna build an avatar around me and people like me so that if I'm serving people like me I know how to talk to them and then we're gonna profile Brian's type of person that likes a philosophy. So profile both of them okay, so then you give them the Him it the the over-delivered PDF okay Tell it what you love about it What was good? But tell them what's tedious for you why it's tedious how it's tedious if you could fix it how you would fix it and give an Example like this is written blah blah blah blah blah blah blah all I wanted to say is
01:09:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
this.
01:09:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want a tactical executable thing. For example, this. Okay, now I want you to go through the whole rest of the book. And I want you to pull out five specific tactics that you think are the most leverageable for any business owner. Okay, first, tell me what they are. Let me approve them. Okay, I approve these. Now, I want you to give me the simplest while also being understandable, comprehensible suggestion for tactical implementation in a business. And I want you to give me three examples and turn them into anecdotes starting with one of those tactics. You could probably improve it, but most of that will be actionable all by itself. You can make the over-deliver, you know, basically what, um, BAM is, you know, for BA, something like that, but it it's for you, but guaranteed other people want that. So the pitch to Brian is like, look, not everybody thinks the same way, but the value is still there. Their brains just operate differently. Let's give them this. And so yeah, take all the videos, take the PDF, and then direct it on a mental process, you know, type of vibe avatar.
01:10:34 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
01:10:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think about even exciting too, and take the tediousness out of it, because it's happening so fast, and you get to watch happen and you get to watch it go, I didn't do that. I just directed it, and you whip it all out there. So that could put some energy back into you around something that I felt like it's been draining.
01:10:58 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I mean, the nice thing about the bootcamp is like, I don't have to teach it, and you know, it's like it's a low-ask of me in terms of delivery. I also think that part of, and I share this with Brian's, do think a contributing factor to the number of signups is that we held it in July, because the last time we held it in April. And so I suggested to him, it's like, I think that we should just plan out a bootcamp cadence for the year. So Q1, we do a BA bootcamp, Q2, we do an over-delivered bootcamp, then Q4, we do another BA bootcamp. And we just have those on the calendar.
01:11:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or end of Q3, like, so end of September, where people have been in school, all the college kids are in school, everybody's in school now, and they've had a little time to, you know, because you've got an end. In the country, a huge amount of people start school in August and then September and then the colleges. by the end of September, 1st week of October, you're not in holiday mode and everybody has settled down and starting to fall into their fall routine and I don't think people take enough advantage of that particular time of the year of availability mentally and energetically financially, we recovered the, you know, working during the summer, spending all the expenses there, kind of thing.
01:12:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So anyway, something to take into account. That's true. All right.
01:12:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
got to take my dogs, take your dogs, Hank and, Hank and Hattie, we've got this like calming medicine.
01:12:50 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
We started giving to Hattie for the groupers.
01:12:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. How's that work? What is it?
01:12:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
We have it. It's a. a lot lazza roll or something like that it's It just mellows around we would do it around if there's gonna be fireworks Cuz she gets real nervous with that, but Yeah, we gave her a pill If you find out what the details are and let me know cuz I have a dog that cries every time he gets in the car drives me Bonkers bonkers.
01:13:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, I will let you go. It's so good to catch up with you You just maybe not be such a stranger for a month maybe yeah, no promises You know I wrote on that sheet a couple times couple I saw once I Know once this month and it was last week All right, take care of yourself and I'll talk to you soon. Love you. Bye. too.

No, she got her license last October. Listen to that. Yeah, so she held off. So actually she had to wait. So she got her license like October 10 or something. So soon after that. But I, you know, walked in a couple of times in between whatever reason.
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
at that, like, moderate climate so that you could walk frequently.
00:02:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh my god, this is covering that with Mario. Like, you don't understand how you are. Wait till you go somewhere else.
00:02:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

00:02:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I'm worried about that or the whopping 70 for it.
00:02:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, oh, that's hot for here.
00:02:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That is hilarious. That is hilarious. Um, how where have you gotten on the Marsha stuff? I'm like halfway through another one. Start the wrong one. So I'm gonna try to wrap it up today and start another one. This one's going sort of quick, so it's not. Yeah, so this is still like planning, understanding like it's like deeper into the planning portion of the framework, which is good. So I was like, I'm just gonna go through it all, just to don't miss anything. But yeah, like halfway through. Probably like six more videos, but these ones are all fairly short.
00:03:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And what are we doing? Good. What have you like, have you had any aha since last week?
00:03:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Is Dashboards like this? yesterday. His dashboards are sick. I'm oh my god, they're so good. So he'll make like, he's big into Ikea. It's information, questions, actions. And then he has this other thing that he calls eyes on the journey. So the journey would be like a sales page, right? So he his argument is that there's a journey on the sales page. It's broken up into three eyes. So eyes on the journey is like a little too far. So it's like interest, no, impression, interest, interaction, something, something. And what he does is he sets different events for each. guy. So impressions, super simple page view, and then interest might be, they scroll 50%, and then the next one, it's not what I thought, but that won't be, they hit, they saw the pricing table, and they were there for 10 seconds or whatever. So he was firing these events for each of those things, and then he has like a visual funnel in Looker Studio of that page, and those steps of the funnel with like a breakdown of, hey, X percent did this I, then this I, then this I, and then that's on the right hand side, and then on left hand side, it's all the metrics broken out, so that you see like, oh, your conversion to interest, you had a hundred visitors in your conversion to interest walls. 12% of whatever it is, so that's all correct because you're supposed to be forecasting that already, right? That's part of your plan. Part of your plan is okay, you're either gathering the data and saying these are my baselines and then you're going to try to beat those. That's basically where I'm going to be at. So you just set all this stuff up and start capturing and then recording and learning. Like, hey, these are, this is my opt-in rate right now. Well, if I increase that, the action would be like, I want to increase my opt-in rates. Okay, great. this is what it is. What are you going to do? the action we're going to take, and then what's the outcome that's affecting. But he does that for multiple journeys. So there's like the sales page journey, the cart journey, the opt-in journey, the membership side journey. See, it's all these different... dashboards set up and they look fantastic I'd love to see those so Andy gives Andy gives to you he's like here's all the graphics here's how you build them but I've got no part I showed them to someday they were like oh my God who is this?
00:07:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
oh yeah I'll show you yeah I can give you access to the course to it that's the thing about being the type of people that we are that kind of necessarily are jacks of all trades like we get into some stuff but you can't do all the things really well all the time but when you're meeting the business you have to do a lot of different things like so for example split testing heat maps using split testing software like improved or what was the other one huh yeah visual Yes, so those are things that I used to do and set up and then ended up with, so I was doing them in coffee shop millionaire, well, what year is it, 13 years ago? Or before, a little bit before that, and then the, so that was Anthony Trister, and then Manish Punjabi, which nobody really knows. known kind of behind the scenes like you. And then so Manish and I were working on split testing stuff and he ended up partnering with Justin Christensen and they created conversion fanatics and I was working with them in the beginning. So that was like stuff I did a ton. On the same time I met Mercer was speaking at a little tiny mastermind event by this guy named Jared Elvitch who's also very like hush-hush but was like a mentor to Ryan Lee. The what do you call it? I don't know almost like incestuous bar. Oh yeah early days. Yeah but this so like when I ask you numbers and data and stuff like that I we only spend an hour together week that's the one thing that I kind of miss in being in the businesses more is having more time to really like look at data, set up the systems that capture the data. You don't really, you don't have an optimizer. And especially now, I think, I almost think that that's a role that everybody everybody should have it. But after, you know, at least one million, but probably more in the two four million kind of optimizing. Obviously, you can get there better. But I'm also thinking about the logistics of how many things there are to manage in a business and how much skill a person has when they're first getting to that, you know, even just breaking that six figure mark. There's a whole level of understanding difference between finally getting to that threshold and finally getting to the seven bigger threshold in terms of comprehension of the not nuances, but the facets of business and online business. And then just getting into the next level of it. So to the point of like, you wanting to increase your market share one percent and having determined how much that is being at the, you know, between three and four million spending time doing this, if this was the main thing you accomplish this whole year, is having a system like a really solid optimization system for all of these aspects, right? So there's the landing page, the checkout page, which sometimes is the same depending on what you built it with. Um, if there's an order bump, but then even the thank you page and the download page, which you've been diving into are people even getting their downloads, that type of thing. There is so much, you can't optimize what you don't know to, right?
00:11:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Literally, I was just going to say and people tried to do it all the time. Yeah. Yeah. Like he calls it, he was calling it like he runs into people all the time. And he's called it the curse of a good offer. So that guy's getting offered a throw. up and they throw it on Facebook and they're spending 500 and they're getting a thousand. And they spend a thousand and they're getting two thousand. It's like, then they're like, oh, we got it. Then they spend 10,000 and they get nothing. And they're like, wait a minute. Something broke. They don't know where to look because they were never looking. So, yeah, that's true. So, I don't have that problem. The problem that I have is that I'm not talking the thing. I don't know where new customers come from, but that's my problem. And that's my also the solution to my other problem is how do I get more market share new customers? How do I get new customers? don't know. If I sell one the second, then I can try to sell the first.
00:12:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So, well. keep digging in.
00:13:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh yeah, I just got I got some stuff I'm gonna wait for Mushy to do some stuff. I'm usually soft change her API so he's writing a bunch of our legacy custom code that we have and then when he's done with that he's gonna help me do this custom stuff that I figured out but I just got to wait for him to give me the high sign which could be like a little bit too but I should be further along. Good thing is going through these courses I haven't been like oh I'm doing it wrong where I'm coming.
00:13:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You haven't been doing it wrong but because you do keep getting muffled in and out and like garbled.
00:13:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Just that I haven't changed I know the thing right it's like I need to figure out where new customers come from.
00:13:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think that's going to change. And they're and I don't know the answer so Now I might be surprised by the answer How much time do you figure you've been able to spend each week on this stuff on the Marshall stuff on just yeah At least six eight I don't even know how to like I've got kind of double questions in my head, which is Do you have any desire to increase or maintain that pace and at that pace? At what point do you think you'll be done at least getting through more stuff and are you building as you're going through it?
00:14:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Are you just absorbing? There's been nothing to build yet. There's been no You hold method. That's next. I think next you go in and you actually set up Google Analytics 4. So I think that's going to be me going in, watching all this stuff just to see that I miss anything, right? For instance, he talks about cross domain tracking. I know I used to have that in GA. I do not know if it's in GA 4. I also do not know if it's that I'm saying or different or I don't know what. So if anything like that's missing and then I'll go implement it or it's there and everything's there and then I'll just have a better understanding of what I've already done. So I just set it up and I'm like it's working. I don't know what I did. I got used to work. But like there might be, oh this is like Keith's run out some words for like elements of GA 4 and I was like, oh I didn't know it called that. Okay. So stuff like that.
00:16:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I don't think I heard the answer to, well, I don't.
00:16:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Do I want to do it more? Yeah, sort of part like that quote book. I should have, I was going to take a picture of the quote so I have it. So I'm going to murder it again. But the quote this week was like, you should only be working on high value tasks. Yeah. One of the high value things, so every day I get up and I read that. I'm like, yep, I gotta stay on this Mercer tracking. So, I mean, I would like to do more of it part of the part of the problem right now. No is this puppy. I get saddled with this puppy all the time. I'm like, guys, you're killing me with this puppy. Like, yeah, she's very cute, but she's, she's a huge distraction. Like, what are you doing? What are you doing? So I just have to break away and get something out of or whatever. My child brought home a baby duck. Oh boy.
00:17:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And she got she tied up for me and she did for a few days and then I went into her room. I was looking for something and I heard this little squeaking. There was a duck. A little fluffy yellow adorable duck that either raccoons or dogs will eat.
00:17:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So what's she thinking?
00:17:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. No, I'm like, you don't get to keep it here. But in the meantime, she's waiting until she goes to her dad's for the weekend and she can keep it there. But but anyway, I was going to ask. Speaking child. Why are you bragging about that right now? Um, I had a question. Oh, okay. So, um, I don't think anybody's ever talked to you about. Staying focused on high level activities before.
00:18:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
you sure?
00:18:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know I've talked to myself about it. New content.
00:18:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Dan. Yeah.
00:18:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, like, is that a leveraged activity here? Like, I don't know. There it is.
00:18:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, that's my argument for me doing it. Like, I mean, I already tried this, right? already made my classic lunder. had Eric go through the GTM thing. He went through it. To what end? But did you learn that thing? You get like, no? So, it was like, I can't, I mean, this is the whole thing, right? When I look in the Mercer, and watch Mercer does, I can then go 2 plus 2 equals 4, right? I can then look at whatever business it is and go, oh, I know how I can get that there, because this is how this one works, and that's how that one works. So, I'm watching this stuff yesterday, and I'm like, oh, I would love to know all this about the Wolf Hurry Sales page. I would love to know this. What is happening? Because that's a leverageable point. Hey, have these numbers. We start to forecast and say, and his forecasting is crazy, too. We forecast, like, impressions to the page, opt-in, right, month. We'll have the forecast, and then it's out for 2 years in this spreadsheet that scrolls sideways forever, and at the end of every month. They fill in every metric, they go, how do we do this in turn? Oh, well, look, our impressions were off. Bump-a-bump. Meanwhile, they can go to the report, the eye on the journey report, or whatever they're forecasting, and drop a hat and go, well, how are we doing today, right? So I could do the today thing all day long and know that we're on track, off track with another 71. But I don't look at impressions. I just look at the outcome. So I'm like, oh, it would be interesting to see, like, our impressions changing over time. Like, I can go look at that, but not in an easy, digestible, snapshot-y, dashboard-y way. So I'm like, yeah, all right, that would be good. And then it's super repeatable, then it just would become, especially for me, because all these businesses were the same in a way. It looks like, oh, yeah. If I just build this once, learn it, then can I then just task it and say, I need you to go build an eye on the journey thing for this. And they know, oh, it's all these events, we've got to set up these events. That's the part that I don't know now, but it's JavaScript GTN, like 90% short, which I have personally never used. But it is a thing. Oh, no, we have used it. We've used it for the video time that we did. That's it. Which we could put in a dashboard. You what? Which we could put in the dashboard that we don't. It could go on a dashboard. It doesn't. So for me to really see what's going on with that, I feel like do these weird reports and an active campaign and like, it's not exactly what you want to see, but it's a wave. for me to use that data to find out the best way.
00:22:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's I'm just kind of contemplating the path to this because. So, and I'm trying to think about because you had wicked reports for a while. Because I asked questions about this stuff many times and the question will be like, I don't know, like if I ask a particular metric about a website or the sales page or whatever, where's this, what's this number and I don't know. We've had conversations about dashboards and what I'm trying to figure out is what I. And this is not necessarily relevant for you because we're here now. But like, and I hate when I have so many questions going through my head at the same time and so many thoughts because it can't come out and then they have to be linear, but they're not linear anyway. But the knowledge that. It's hard to impart from my mind the visualization experience that I have of seeing this type of data and having built archaic systems and spreadsheets to track this stuff for myself for different things in the past and then helping somebody, not you per se, but let's say it's a maybe, well, and it wouldn't matter because you'd be doing this for them anyway with basis. But that every person running any kind of business online needs to have a dashboard with basic metrics. to me, what Mercer is teaching is so far beyond what everybody's doing, but it's also basic. Like, these are basic KPI. How long are people there? How many people come? Where did they come from? from like, this is what white heat maps have been around for so long, but almost nobody uses them. Where are they getting paused on the page? And then, but looking at all of the pages that matter, so landing pages, all of the sections of the page that matter, how like, they're still not really a good provider of that for smaller businesses. I'm trying to think Neil Patel has stuff, but he's not affordable to everybody. Mercer is not, is so complicated that most people aren't going to go through this or understand it even if they do, but they'll be fried before they even get to most of it. If there was such a need for a, don't even know what you would call this, but like, the website optimizer type person, like a person who is just about the data, who either directs or does all the work, I say direct because they don't necessarily need to be the one that installs the tracking codes and installs the heat map codes and any of the code on the pages, but they need to be the one that says I need this code, they need to be the one that can validate that it's working because the reports are coming, they should be the one that would be kind of masters of dashboards and knowing what types of dashboards we need, that there are different types to look at so you're not looking on a ton of data like we've been doing with Letify, like there's the intake dashboard and then the matters dashboard. Anyway, thinking about the, which is anyway, just how there should be a role whole for you. it starts though, it starts like this, it starts with knowing what you don't know from first 10 experience by learning through it and going through it so that you know how number one's even just create the like rudimentary version of what is needed but then so you're informed and know how to hire somebody for this role because you have enough knowledge to be able to engage in a conversation where you can evacuate it and know what they have access to but anyway that was a really long way to get at there's there's a way that we need to leverage this moving forward and apply it to anything that you're working on any project that you're working on and then also for me in the back of my head like pretty much anybody I'm working with needs to be doing something to this degree and I have not done a good job of Being able to relay First of all, what's even possible because this is not new the stuff that Master's talking about is not new He's been talking about the same stuff for at least 13 years.
00:27:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We have this At breakfast one day But it's Right the great part about his stuff like my stuff is He did it for himself So he's like, this is exactly what we do and this is and we learned our way into this. So I'm like, okay You're right. mean, this is like a total bolt-on to basis and You know, I would the reason people Don't or can't offer this as a service really is like good luck Good luck going into some random website and and being able to just easily At all this code and at all that like no Not gonna happen Yeah, and I actually think that's too hard.
00:27:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It hasn't been streamed by yet is because I doubt you would remember me bringing it up in the beginning, but one of the things that we talked about in the beginning when we started talking about data is how unreliable it is, which we did, I know you would remember that part of the conversation, but in that one of the ways we could validate it would be that all the different data sources disagreed with each other. Like visual or website optimizer versus improvedly, different stats, even if we've got both the code on there versus Google analytics versus wicked reports, whatever, nothing ever reported the same thing. So you know that there's discrepancies and then who's right? Is any of them right? And then if they're right, what's getting in the way.
00:28:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's a bigger problem now than ever. That's the that's the thing that this advent of GA4 and the advent of these pixel blockers or whatever is that attribution has become more difficult than ever right so but my argument is that if you are in a world my world where I can drop a first party pixel I am fully integrated with I have the full integration with segment tricks 99% of people can't do either of those so I'm like okay I have all these things I'm the dude that Mercer described as I have been a collector like I'm collecting all the data and I'm collecting the data that has meaning but I've been as you know as I've been complaining about forever like I can't connect the dots like I can't see the things that I want to see and now I'm like oh this is but this is Show me some things that I didn't know before like, okay, I can get some data into Metarick and I can get some data. So I think between like GA4, Metarick and Segmentrix, which might not even be needed, but it's there. I'm like, I'm going to be able to get an attribution picture that no one else can get. And then Mercer, I'm positive, is going to nerd out on that. He'll be like, what are you doing? And then, again, that becomes something that like, oh yeah, no, you can only get this with basis, right? That's it. And it just, it's like things are getting more complicated. And so, and if the data becomes less reliable, then you can't make data-driven decisions. And as we know, if you're not making data-driven decisions, you're really just guessing. And guessing only works some of the time, most of the time does work.
00:30:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:31:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And like the good job is in the click funnels and the go high levels of the world like they're not gonna solve it Yeah, but and then this is not meant for It's not meant to be like a mass product, right? I told it's funny that the development like to the general public Yeah, well, yeah, I mean it's it's not Truly scalable like the more I think about it as I'm going through as far as I'm oh, the price needs to be even higher It should be like it should be prohibited to get on it And like no if you want to get on this you have to understand What you're getting on and it's like you want us almost?
00:31:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
shy away the people That can't that can barely afford it because they're just playing and not get it or whatever Yep, well and because it's a it's a Longer runway to And that means that there's constantly a burden of having to prove the value, which is why they're complaining, right? Because if they knew that they were putting in a dollar and getting out to, nobody would say no. Right. when, and this is, so there's two components to it. Number one, people that are doing, you know, multiple seven through the gears versus not less than that, there's, there's corollary data points, which is not just their revenue, but also their traffic. And in order for to collect enough data to be relevant and, and to be able to analyze it and get something useful from it, there has to be a significant amount of traffic. Or you have to wait a long time, but either way, so, so when they've got more volumes, they're doing more cells. They probably have a lot more traffic, which means we get to the data faster, which means they can see the correlation faster. And then all of that data leads to a split test, right? So here's our baseline. What's the point of doing that if you're measuring it, if you're not going to improve it. So then, you know, and if you're going to improve it, you don't just do something and think, I know for sure it's going to work, it's a split test. And then you run the test, but obviously there for it to be conclusive, you've got again, volume. So that's another reason why only offering it to people who have a certain level of success, traffic, sales, whatever, would be good, especially if you're just like, I don't know, proving out the concept, getting case studies, Glenn never had enough traffic. Jody out, he didn't even have What's that?
00:34:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
think he did. Well, he didn't hit a personal website. Yeah, totally. Well, I've got like, they're like a, they've got the right stuff and they're on it. They'll be a good case study. Joe, like with Joe, it'll just be like, what are the metrics that matter for a podcaster? once you know what they are, right, like you leads and listens, whatever it is, then you build the dashboard around that. Once you know, I mean, you're going to have like this funk of JavaScript that you're going to par you's over and over again, you're going to get chat GPT to be your little, you know, I have Eric building these assistants where it's like, hey, this is a vanilla JavaScript assistant. And then this one's a Gutenberg JavaScript assistant, and then this one's going to be a GTN JavaScript assistant. And you just keep running the same types of code into the thing. You're like, all right, I really wish you those could get smarter, but they really can, but whatever. I mean, yeah, it's like, You can, if it works, right, of course, you know me, I'm like, yeah, we'll see. I mean, it all makes sense, but like, I need to see it, I need to see it, and I need for it to have meaning to me. And I obviously know the power of data, right? So it's like, oh, okay, that's the other thing with other people, like, they don't really get it. Like, I was just helping someone out. And they're like, yeah, we're paying. They said, like, oh, God, we turn off the ads. We're paying $250 a lead. I'm like, how do you even know that? That's what Facebook said. Yeah, but is that true? Oh, I don't know. When I looked at like their CRM. And I didn't tell them this, but I like, I did some quick math and I'm like, I'm at 90. So I'm like, but I'm not sure. Like, I have to really like, you know, do a little scrub or whatever. D do bit. I'm like, yeah, whatever number Getting from Facebook is wrong and they killed their ads and then 48 hours later like we got to turn our ads back on Which never was Yeah, and I'm like, but you're gonna Do you even know which ones converted and they don't mean I know they don't cuz I looked and I was like you guys aren't Bragging anything. Oh PS. know, you've had this was great. I mean you've had five hundred inbound calls And it looks like everyone I looked at no one answered And they're like really I go What's going on? Like where are those going that no one answers 500 calls in 60 days? Like that's a lot of calls per day. Sorry, right? So they're like, oh And that's the word that sometimes that's a good answer and sometimes that's a bad answer in this case.
00:36:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
a bad answer You shouldn't know I Was thinking you know if you get to the point to You Well, whether you have this analytics type dashboard thing or not, either way, if you get to spelling bases, I think the best thing would be a VSL because it really is a visual concept. think about all the exercises that we've done and the reason dashboards are so powerful. Like, we can talk about the numbers, but unless you're a savant really processing those without a chart, know, kind of seeing visually a relationship between this number and this number, it's hard to wrap your head around it the first time you see it, the second time you see it, the third time you see it. So if you're just trying to explain to somebody like having a sales conversation, they'll see, you know, just a portion of it, whereas if You say, like, before we even talk about it, you've got to go watch this video. You can't get on, you're not allowed, you don't get access to this, I know you've heard great things, it doesn't matter, you can give me all the money in the world, you cannot come here unless you watch this video and the video, like, we had the leaky bucket kind of visual that you've made to explain that to people and that was an aha moment for them. Now, if we could show something and I would have, you know, Joe used to make videos like this, there are definitely people who can make these videos that we could outsource it to, basically show them two or three different scenarios where, you know, this is your business, this is your traffic, and these are your steps on the dashboard and this is what business A has, what business B has, what business T has. And this is what they did, and then you watch them, watch the numbers change. And then you can tell the story where a business A had no idea, like these numbers are changing, but business A doesn't have a dashboard, doesn't track it, has no idea what's happening. so makes a decision by guessing, and it's the wrong decision because they didn't know why the numbers were, why they, you know, what they were, whereas let's say business B, same exact person has all the data, or maybe business B has half the data, right, makes a decision, same thing, doesn't go right because they're wrong about where the data, because they only have half the data, it's not accurate. And business C is like, oh, I can see everything, here's the problem, let's go fix it. And we've done X amount of split test because we've been tracking this. And so we know that we'll have
00:40:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
you know better impact changing the headline or the image or the call to action or whatever but basically creating a video showing it could be like one video or multiple videos could be case studies but another could be like i'm talking about going after 10 million 20 million 30 40 50 million dollar businesses and charging a premium price premium um yeah i think that yeah i'm starting to think like so funny because a perfect example of that right there is Dave Asbury right so Jenny is doing all the Dave Asbury stuff now running his stuff and their setup is so clued it's not even funny what is that word oh messed up flute means messed up yeah so yeah so it's it's all Stop it. It just doesn't make sense and it's because it it's like it's the classic like you went It was it's just all inherited And so they just keep adding on right to Christmas tree and on to the Charlie Brown tree they inherited when it's like oh boy So the day she's like we're moving everything to Shopify. They sell like single products like that is not what Shopify is for Shopify is not made for that and then it's like They're they're not they don't have all the right data like even though Jimmy's very day-to-driven They don't have all the right data. I'm like dude. You should be on WooCommerce like WooCommerce and funnel kid because there's no limit That's my argument. That's the argument that I made to Frank the WordPress bill, but he's like give me the back story Tell me what you're trying to build and I told me he's like oh, Yeah, he's like you sound like you know what you're doing like you sound like you really he's like you So I'm like, you know, a lot about business. He's like, I know a lot about teaching stuff. He's like, I suck at business. Maybe you could help me better at business. like, yeah, maybe. But it's like, I think that the path is like, you go through Joe, right? So it becomes a tool for Joe to make Joe's coaching business easier. And then it's like, who's another Joe? Maria. Maria wants to go build all these customer automatic customer things.
00:42:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could build an automatic customer starter site. Automatic clients, Alan.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, automatic client. I could build an automatic client starter site that's just in the can. You launch it and reskin it for your next client. So then she's she'll get all the she wants and then some, right? then it's like, oh, who else is that? could go to like Greg Merley's and be like, hey, you should just be sending your clients to me because we can build because it's your designs are great, supposedly. don't know if they are, but he does good work. This platform is great. Yeah, exactly. I don't know if they really perform that well, but you can find out really quick by putting on a platform that gives you that data. So then it's like you having these other people sell it for you in the beginning. And I think to your point, it will eventually bubble up, right? So you could go like into Allen's group or go to Allen and be like, Hey, I'm doing this. But it's like, it's like, it's like, it's not open to the public really, right? It's like, we're, I don't want to deal with people. Like, I want to give a good service and good product to good people, right? Cool people, cool things, cool people. I'm not, I'm not trying to run around and get 10,000 clients because I just don't want to deal with that. But if I can get like, 10,000 clients, like, yeah, exactly. And then some people are going to, have are going to be a lot, they're going to need the funnels and the bop-a-bop, they're going to need the whole thing. And then it's like, yeah, then maybe you could append coaching or, and at that point, if you're not even coaching, you're just, it is, because you're like, you should be collecting this data, right? But you need to get, you need to expand what you're doing in analytics, because right, what you get is just the basic. But you want dashboards like this. Oh, okay. Well, yeah, that's, it's, it's a one time fee of $4,000. And we set the whole thing up for you. And then it's tracking all that stuff. And here's how you read it. And then that's it.
00:44:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But, I'm set up of like 10,000, like it's just, whatever, yeah, whatever it is. mean, don't even know how to price it, because I don't even know what it is yet. And like, I would not be looking in the, I am world. I'd be looking at doctors and lawyers, like, where are they congregating?
00:45:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But it's not that I am world is on saying no, no, I know, but the other day I was thinking like, I mean, it could be it could be like these coaches in the world are not the lame ones, like the ones that have real businesses, like not the one that I left, I mean, I don't have a room business. I left a hilarious comment on someone's ad today. Some woman's like, I just can't stand these people. She's like, if you want to get my $50 million a year business . If you were making $50 million a year, you would not be running Facebook ads about your coaching business. Ma'am, give me a break.
00:45:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you look like?
00:45:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You look like a bottle blonde that is using 20 year old photos on your website, like a miss. You're not the same person. I can't remember her name. It's, I've never seen her before. And I saw like two of her ads today and then I just left a comment on her. was like, I can't help myself. But, but it was like the click funnels awards, the lame, the stupid, um, sign with the slogan, I'm like, really? I'm like, this is like a textbook. I am scammer. Like, where's the Lambo? What are you doing? Yeah, never, never be gone.
00:46:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
email version of it is it repulses me personally because, because I see behind it, because I know what game they played.
00:46:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Um, anyway, I'm just so never them. It would be never that, right? like, it's not for you. So, and that would be very easy to figure out. You just go look at their website like, yeah, no, this isn't for you or you're not for being one way or the other. Um, but it's like those, those automatic customer funnels, like they can go either way, they can either be scammy or not. Um, yeah, it's like you get to. you get to decide. That's the whole thing. mean, they can't just buy it. It's not a do-it-yourself thing. It's never going to be. But I was thinking like two days ago, was like, man, really, what are you replacing? Like, you're replacing Upwork, you're replacing way more than just WordPress and Kajabi. It's really not on par with those. It's on a whole other level.
00:47:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Therefore, it should be priced on another level. But it's more than that. It's not about what are you replacing it because if you go with that logic, then they're going to try to do that math. And that is not really what the math is. It's like you've been walking around legally blind and somebody finally gave you glasses that are your prescription. And now you can see everything clearly and sharply. didn't have the glasses before. So you're not replacing something.
00:48:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
getting something life changing that literally changes the way you see the world it's going to stop you from tripping on everything and you know like it's just the correlation is different it's more i mean i was thinking more like it's the benefit argument right what are the benefits the benefits are what you're saying you're going get this better knowledge into your metric you're going to get a better faster sigh you're going to have to you'll never have you don't have deal with outside devs ever or deal like that's gone right so you're getting time back you're getting you're getting all this up oh what are all the benefits now you could throw away the comparative idea like oh it's it benefits like this over kajabi rather than replace kajabi you'd say hey you don't have to deal with outside developers and outside designers like all that goes away you're going to save time and energy there whatever bye
00:49:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
stop believing money because they're making stupid decisions because they're uninformed.
00:49:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Then you can start to make start to know your business on like a whole other level when then that I think that's key, right? It was like when I was on the forum with Jamie and Heather the other day and like Jamie's like, okay, gonna make these videos. No, she's talking about Instagram getting Instagram leads. I'm like, well, like Instagram leads have never really been proven to work, right? So if you go do a source report, which, you know, we can sort of do one of those. The data is somewhat there. And I, again, I would argue my data is better than everyone else's because I'm getting them forced when they become a lead. Now, could they have gone to YouTube before that or whatever? Yeah, maybe whatever. But when they entered, I keep calling this like first contact and what last contact people call first touch. Like, yeah, maybe their touch came through YouTube, but we can't, you can't trace touch. I can trace contact, right? can trace that hey, they entered our world One of contacts the right word still, but it's like they became lead and they came from this source It's far but I'm concerned. That's the source Right and then engagement instead of touch or contact Yeah, it's gonna be something else. It's like you can't use it's got to be a new word It's like yeah, like I can't use a word that's already used right so engagement's already used touch is used Contact is going to use Something I haven't read it through we'll read it through chat you can table immediately, but it's really good at that So it will be able to help you come up the word if you define what it looks like so it's not touch Like what does that look like to you and and what makes it not one thing but something else Well, I mean you could say well and I want to use the same word for the beginning and the end Right, so it's like your last so when they purchase it's that's the last version of the first version is a lead The last version is they purchased right so it's like Not interaction like it's some other word, but anyway, so when I was talking to her about it It was like I'm saying I'm gonna get an Instagram do more. I go well. Okay, you get more leads on Instagram. So what? So what you got more leads on Instagram, right? I'm like more leads is not gonna solve the problem. The problem is that you don't right She's making the cloud. go this is the classic blender get more leads like that's not the answer And she's like let me see if I get this street So you're saying if we go get more leads, we're not gonna make more money I'm like, that's exactly what I'm saying and she couldn't put it together And I go but if you I go that's not entirely true if you go get more YouTube leads They will convert therefore you will make more money. the question really is how do you get more YouTube leads? That's the question to me to answer because that's where your money comes from and she doesn't have an answer for that. So I'm like, if you don't have an answer for it, then I mean, it's not all that you can do. But if I can right now go spend $10,000 on Google Ads, I'll get a lot of leads and I won't get $10,000 back.
00:52:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Have you ever done YouTube ads?
00:52:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, we ran some YouTube ads, but like, it's you can't track them, right? You can't track like the Tom Breeze ones, so you run the ad goes to the channel so you don't get attribution back to YouTube or the ad. So you could look to see like, hey, when I was running these ads, and this is like, it's hard, it's very hard to do because you can't necessarily say, hey, when the period of time I was running these ads did leads go up. So you could do that and say yes or no, but then you have to dig deeper and go. Did all the videos have the same average views as the other period or did she put up a banner video or did this video from whatever so you'd have to look at these Intermatrix of like Did the referring video like which? Did the leads coming in go up? Where did they come from which video to go up and then does that make sense right? Does it make sense that this the video that usually drives leads went up? Therefore my running ads sort of juiced that That would probably be the way to do it I'm thinking I actually do that. I just never did it.
00:53:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I'm not going to because they don't have any money run as Well, I'm pretty sure that was like one of the first goals Or things I said when we were talking about you doing level activity, part of when we do your effective hourly rate, years ago, was saying that whether you hired and trained or just hired somebody who could do ads well for you, that especially if it was somebody where you could say, okay, this is what we should be trying, like, so you're the strategist, at least or consult on it, but somebody that is good at doing it, but you know, did add like you and did the containers the way that you did, but how it keeps changing, the hiring pool keeps changing, so the thing about what I just said is like, I'm the only one that can do that, like not me personally, but like me Dan Ryan basis because nobody tracks the leads from their videos with the that I built.
00:55:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
of that, right? It's because I have that data. Now, in the Mercer world, that data would be in a dashboard and you'd be able to look at that at the drop of the hat. Yeah. I hadn't considered.
00:55:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which would change everything that you do in terms of add the lead generation, which is a huge part of your world and your puzzles at the very least, even if it's not necessarily part of basis, which could be. But anyway, yeah.
00:55:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, because that's like another avatar is like the Jamie, right? It's like going after the YouTubers and just saying, Hey, I've got a I've got this thing that's good for YouTubers. You should be on this because you get all this stuff. But I think part of the like Jamie is that they're like, I follow this to Rick Biano. who's got this massive YouTube channel and he's like this super music nerd he does great interviews but that MFR is running like a sale every other week and I'm like dude please stop stop running sales like you're losing money who's ever guiding you is guiding you incorrectly every week it's some stupid sale like you're devaluing yourself this is not a good thing but they're probably at the end of the week going oh look we got $10,000 in sales like oh geez no don't do that but he's like a he's a perfect YouTube and I can tell you right now he has no idea which videos drive business because nobody's ever nobody's ever done it on braces like I had never seen somebody do this yeah but I think will be interesting now a year from now because of AI like
00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Google's integrated AI into search results, Google on YouTube, YouTube definitely has the AI, like what, whether or not it's available at a free level, which I don't imagine they'd want to, but I feel like, we don't know, that better analytics for this stuff is not too far away unless they want you to stay operating blind so that you keep guessing, so that you basically are gambling.
00:57:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And that was the upshot of that video that I mentioned a couple weeks ago where the guy turned off all the black box stuff and got better results. he was like, the less I told them, the better I did. But that's because, you know, they just want us to take your money.
00:57:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but we're
00:58:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
right and that's why this stuff like I mean the thing that I don't know that someone brought up to they were like oh well you know stafari strips strips the utms I think that is true but I'm like I don't have that problem if just switch them all to PGT they are utms and then now I can't I can't tell google analytics that they're utms but I can get that data in google analytics as like an alternative utm right as these events better and then prime build dashboards based on those as if they were utms they are they act just like them they just literally are not them I was like that's something else other people can't do you
00:59:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
last week on. The summer pace is always a little slower and slower. The strolls to work. I got my dog and he made me my mom. can't wait for the kids to finish the Is it what are they doing building it? Well, it's a came, you know, all the parts. So they didn't have to like engineer it and blueprint and design it. But it's it's been, you know, top to bottom, start to finish building it. Oh, and almost done. What was I looking at? on. Sorry. I lost my notes when I lost my. mouse. I mean, that's all the stuff that we're working on really. OK, and hopefully you don't have to run anywhere. Just ask some quick questions about just whatever else has been happening. Rapid fire, rapid fire, rapid fire. Well, touching any of the projects, just just anything that stands out as a problem, an epiphany, an aha, since we talked last.
01:01:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
very near higher Frank. Frank is definitely next level. So I think that's all gonna get done well and good. Norio finished. Perfect wedding timeline. And he released it to Abishik for software testing. So they're going back and forth right now. So Norio's like go find the thing. So he's like, all right, now we're in stage two. Bugs washing. So we'll get him to try and find some stuff. Then we'll let some people on it, let them start using it. And then it'll be like, then we can release it for like public consumption. Which my plan there now is, this is so weird like, so Jamie's tagline is lovely humans. So like over a year ago, that domain was for sale and I bought it. never told anyone.
01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
one.
01:02:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then I started to figure the other day, like, I need them to give me this domain, like the whole point of me telling them to come up with a brand name so that I could be brand.
01:02:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You need them to give you what domain?
01:02:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
To take that. need to do ownership domain, and we'll keep using that name. But the domain needs to be my name now. And I was like, she's never going to do that. And then I thought, Oh, wait, I'm going to trade her domains. I'll give you lovely, lovely humans and you're going to give me perfect wedding time line. And she 1000% will do that. And I paid like 900 bucks for the domain or something. So I like, I got to do that. So then we can roll that out. And then I think, I'm just going to tell Heather and Jamie, but just tell the dude, Hey, just working with another vendor. That's it. Like, you don't owe the guy an explanation. Just say, yeah, we're working with another vendor that we can. That's it.
01:03:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What guy?
01:03:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And the timeline genius, the guy that's getting- Oh. They're doing like a 50-50 rev split, but like he actually makes more money because we have to pay someone to do all the customer service. So he actually makes more money. So, but I think I'm going to, I mean, kind of want to tell them like we have to change the split, maybe, or I haven't really figured it out yet. So anyway, so that's going to, so now Norio's available. And then I hit him up yesterday, I go, okay, great, can you start working on this fan flowy stuff? And he's like, absolutely. So I had a couple of tasks there for Saad, he wasn't responding, and then all of a sudden today, he's like, done done. So we'll see if those are done that we can finish this Spotify integration, but then I'm going to unleash Norio on like the two or three apps. We want there, which he should probably be like, dude, this is simple. I go, well, the other is even simpler. One might not be. I'm going to hold that one for the last. going to get some clarification on how to build this. We need to build some sort of API into GoDaddy that will allow people to make sub-domains on fan flow. I know it's possible. just not sure. It's actually the right move. But anyway, Noreo can start working on that stuff.
01:04:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to hit up Mark and then take that lead. Because you can make sub-domains on high level also, can't you? It doesn't have to be done at the registrar.
01:04:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It does with all this new email . You got to append all those extra records. But yeah, so yes and no. You're going to want it to be custom. They'll get to pick the sub-domains. but we're going to be like it should be your band name teama gang dot fan flowy dot com so that won't probably be last because i think it's the most complicated but i'm going to actually ask i level like hey how would i do this uh and then i'm going to go back to shot and mark and then they've got so many bands on this now so we need to like take a step back and like clean up some stuff but like the core stuff is built it works it people are getting results right now i'm like we just need to clean up some stuff and then go this you know version one was waiting for the Spotify thing stamp it as version one but like okay and then i'm like you guys need to charge everyone that's on there right now a subscription like you should not be selling this as and and um and included it should be hey start your subscription and then we're going to charge you to run your ads above the clock because you're your bypass the whole primary model of it being a recurring subscription based business, right? You're you're including the software for free. That's a mistake. Like, now, if you want to, like, give these guys like, uh, founders price that we never take away, fine. I'm totally okay with that. Let's do that. But they need to, they need to be running subscriptions and then because then they can tell people, oh, I have a subscription, but you might not be able to get the price that I get.
01:06:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then I was like, okay, value of the software and service.
01:06:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. So then I was like, all right, we're going to do that and they'll do it. And then it was like, then I started thinking similar line to your, like, I told Darryl about it and Darryl was like, what? are you building?
01:06:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I told him, I was like, I have to, I'm sorry. Every time I think this, did you ever watch Darryl? Larry Larry Larry Larry Larry Larry my brother Dale Every time you see Daryl every time. I'm all the brother.
01:07:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No Okay, I told Daryl and I was like, oh man, I just got to figure out the math of this So once we have like whatever the price is I was like we should do an affiliate thing with Darryl's Daryl's in the studio with a band every week Every week. I'm like if we made him an affiliate and we paid him a percentage of the script subscription for a fixed period of time Right. Hey, you get x percent for the first Six months or if they stick three months you get x percent and it's equal to Why So for every band you get on you're going to make 200 bucks or whatever it is he'll refer it out all day long. And I'm like, how many other darels are there? Or maybe you do pay them in perpetuity, like high level. If I came in as long as I stay on, then he's even more motivated to do it.
01:08:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yes. But it could be like, there's a higher front end costs or whatever reward. No, because you don't want to tend to bring people. So tear it up. So once you bring us, you know, 20 people, and it has to be how many people are currently subscribers. So let's say if you get up to 50 subscribers, so up to 50 subscribers, it's like 4%. 50 subscribers active and above, it's 5%, whatever. numbers mean nothing. point is that you unlock the levels by how many existing subscribers you get. Yeah. So that they are incentivized to bring people that stay because then he doesn't have to keep replacing them just like, you know, any other business, you're better off having to go chase down new customers. And, and then he unlocks higher levels. And like, why would you not want to pay somebody? there's a marketing budget anyway.
01:09:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's just basically the marketing budget, they go get you customers. And he'll get bulls-eye customers, right? And then it's like, okay, and then if you only have a handful of them and those guys know people, right? So it's like, yeah, if we just open this up to a handful of people, like, it's not come one, come all sign up for our affiliate program. No, no, it's like, taste maker affiliate program. And if you get like 12 or 20 people that are dialed in, they'll do it. Especially, I mean, because it's going to be, it is going to progress. So that stuff's all going, and then it's just like with another 71, it's like steady eddy. We're still climbing towards the 490, which I think I figured it out the other day, sometime in September.
01:10:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:10:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Here's September. Yeah. Yeah. We should hit that, and then I got some other, like the dent repair guys, those are the dudes I was talking about earlier that have all the leads, like they want, they want to build, it is interesting. like, do you think you could build a PDR as the name of the industry, or do you think you could build a PDR version of high level that could, we could sell the PDR industry?
01:10:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
go, yeah. Yeah. What's PDR?
01:10:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
A painless dent repair. Oh. So like their, their business is a show and, but they're making money hand over fist, and I'm like, but you're probably losing money hand over That's sort of that that's sort of that the hidden the hidden thing, right? It's like By not knowing all your numbers. You're you're losing money You just can't you just can't see it. Yeah, yep, sort of like mark like mark on Monday. Like he's coming It's coming around to what the real problem is mark. You pay people too much hate to break it to you He's known so last year No, I know but now it's becoming like Painful. Yeah, yep, and painful is when the change comes and and the reason he did it Was to be a nice guy Right, he didn't he didn't do it because oh it wasn't for retention. It wasn't for whatever It was for Whatever it was to feel a good number room I think that's part of it, but I think part of it was retention because he was if you remember Really concerned about losing people, especially samantha I But I just don't know if his concerns real, and I think that I think that's also happened. No, I don't think it is, but I think it was to him for a long time. Yeah, yeah. definitely.
01:12:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He the theft. Yeah, that like, and how long it takes to replace people and the comfort like people weren't as happy.
01:12:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh my God, the revelation was wait, these people don't need to be lawyers. I was floored when he said that. I'm like, whoa, And he's like, yeah, no, they don't need to be lawyers. So I'm like, oh, well, that totally changes things, right? Because you cannot, he cannot tell me, and especially if you talk to Salko, Salko's like, dude, this isn't that hard. He's like, these guys, they're not lawyers. Like Sam and Tyler, and they're not lawyers. They are not. He's like, they are people with law licenses. There's a huge difference. mean, he would argue that. Mark is not a lawyer. He's like mark has never set foot in the courtroom ever and he never will so it's like ever Yeah, most of them won't most of them never will because I know that's right doesn't want to that's why he likes this I mean, that's the track that they're on right so in a way they're completely overpaid and now even more so I'm like Dude, they're really overpaid and you know, I just keep saying it But it's like I know the time's not right, but I know the time is also rapidly approaching If you start to dial in these processes, which is happening with intake, which is where it should start You start dialing in these processes You're he's gonna discover. Oh, yeah, I don't need lawyers Like you could because it's all It's there's no if you're never going into the courtroom Right if you're never going in and trying to woo a jury and get a higher verdict And you're just dealing with the black and white. It's either there or it's not Right so you can't make an argument to get this huge settlement when the policy doesn't go that high. So there are these built limitations, but the processes don't exist, right? like in Salko's point, that's why the whole AI conversation I had with Salko when I was like, oh, no, no, you could teach it to look for words. And he was like, oh, wait, what, really? Yeah, yeah, totally.
01:14:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But, okay, so, and this is why I take a holistic approach to business is because the CEO is always a bottle that one way or another. all are, because we're But one of Mark's issues. I know I am. Same. Is that he needed Bonparone, but now he's making friends.
01:14:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes, exactly. All kinds of things happening.
01:14:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yes, yes. So his need for that is changing. And in, I, I didn't put the two together before, but you know, yeah, anyway, that's what happens when people and it's like, you're looking at the map on the page and I mean, he knew it.
01:15:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I wasn't even really sure, but it came out of his mouth. He's like, oh, it's way too high. I'm like, yeah, probably is.
01:15:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, what?
01:15:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
When he was talking about payroll, he's like, my overhead is way too high. And then we, and then he drilled it further and said the overhead is payroll.

That's the other interesting thing. I don't think he had thought about it. It didn't seem like it to me, but I'm like, dude, if you're just growing and you're not making more money, what are you doing? And he thought it was to sell the firm and I'm like, but is that, is that what the multiple is based on? And he's like, no, not really, right? It's like, oh, it's the cases. That's the thing. I think he's starting to see that. I mean, he's done it. He's on pace to do almost a hundred this month into the math yesterday. I think it's in 94 Not counting whatever closed yesterday. I sorted I could be slightly off. So he's on pace to do a hundred in July where there's a holiday in the summer Right three things three things that are against that happen with his best lead source Monday getting the bed Totally just doing horrible and it's like get here you are and You know what? not hearing I'm overwhelmed. I can't we need more pods like it's not a trip That is not true. That's the next thing bringing it that up Monday Yeah Bring that up Monday And if anyone's gonna complain about being overwhelmed, it would be in California in the summer Cuz they're like I'm missing out going it's not like something like dude every time I talk to Tyler, he's at the airport, going somewhere, like I believe in me.

Okay, so the last thing that I wanted to say, well, two parts, I don't know, my brain is like shutting down now, but that even our thoughts are iterative, you know, like, because we are changing, having new thoughts constantly, like it gets frustrating because like something will be obvious to you, something will be obvious to me, but that's, we're thinking based on our lenses, based on our experience, but also based on our makeup, being, for example, you're happily married with two kids, and like, home life matters, and our ability to make certain types of decisions is affected and affected and infected by the rest of our circumstances and so changing those things, changing his morning routine, him changing friendships, changing all these different things, makes him able to make decisions he couldn't have made before because Mark as a person, as an emotional creature, which we all are, as EOR, needed to make alterations, but those changes don't happen like that. They don't happen overnight. They don't happen because we had a conversation last week and you immediately apply it and change it and then you get the impact and effect and but it's it's all gradual. It's all a gradient spectrum type of changes, results of changes. Now we have new insight. Now we have new lenses. Now we see things differently. we know more things. things. Now we've altered our environment and the gist. That's why it's so complicated. That's why pacing matters so much. I know, you know, like I'm not preaching to you, but it's just every week, I think about, you know, what we could have done and what we already knew, but you can't take the person out of the equation. But, and that's also why, if you're going to launch basis, your first few people, 100% because that interaction is probably going to be more weighty than maybe down the road when you streamline everything. Those should be the most cherry-picked kind of clients, partners, whatever that you bring on, because that will affect the trajectory, I guess, of how basis evolves. because no matter how much we want to think of it as a system, a process, a product, whatever, you're at the center of it and whoever you're interacting with regularly is at the center of it and that energy makes a huge impact on the decisions that get made so the path that gets plotted out and so on. Yeah, anyway, just pondering, I guess. And my brain is going, I need food and probably nap. Well, I get a massage in two hours. My Russian massage Elena, she's so good. She's like scary also because she's Russian, but also she's like a second mama and loving and it's awesome. It's a 90 minute massage and I'm gonna go nap after that.
