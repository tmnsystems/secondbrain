   - Transcripts are cleaned and structured

2. **Topic Analysis**
   - Content is analyzed using NLP techniques
   - Topics are identified and tagged

3. **Quote Extraction**
   - Relevant quotes are extracted via `enhanced_topic_extraction.py`
   - Metadata is added for context and attribution

4. **Quality Filtering**
   - Quotes are scored for quality and relevance
   - High-quality quotes are selected for the curated files

## Usage Guide

   - For highest quality insights, use the `*_high_quality_quotes.md` files

2. **Searching Across Topics**

   - Look for recurring themes across different pillar topics

3. **Generating New Content**
   - Extract quotes can be used as source material for articles, courses, etc.
   - Maintain attribution when using quotes in generated content

4. **Updating Extract Files**
