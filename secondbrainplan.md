## Implementation Approach

The implementation will follow a progressive, iterative approach:

1. Begin with core functionality development
2. Start with simpler content and progressively add complexity
3. Implement regular evaluation checkpoints
4. Use a combination of automated and human evaluation
5. Continuously refine based on feedback
6. Prioritize components based on impact vs. effort
7. Develop specialized modules for each pillar topic
8. Include regular human feedback in the development cycle
9. Create a system that learns from its mistakes
10. Build in transparency and explainability
