# Chapter Two: Simple Finance Systems - What Comes In > What Goes Out

## The Foundation of Business Freedom (Even Though You Hate Numbers)

Let me tell you something that might surprise you.

Most entrepreneurs I've worked with over the last 22 years *hate* numbers. They didn't start their business because they love spreadsheets, profit margins, or balancing books. They started because they're passionate about what they do and wanted freedom.

Yet here I am, dedicating our second chapter to finance systems.

Why? Because without getting this right, nothing else matters. You can have the most brilliant marketing, the best team, and the most optimized operations in the world – but if what comes in doesn't exceed what goes out, you're just building an expensive hobby.

I've helped several startups grow to million-dollar businesses within a year, and others to multi-million dollar companies in under three years from their inception. In every single case, mastering simple finance systems was the foundation everything else was built on.

The good news? You don't need to become an accountant. You just need a few simple systems that give you clarity and control.

## Math Is Your Friend (Yes, Really)

Let me say something controversial: Math is your friend.

I know – most entrepreneurs would rather do almost anything than crunch numbers. But here's the thing: numbers don't lie. They tell you exactly what's working and what isn't.

The goal isn't to become obsessed with every penny. The goal is to have enough awareness of your numbers that you can make confident decisions and sleep at night knowing exactly where you stand.

Most entrepreneurs get started because they are unsatisfied with the status quo in some way or another and find the only solution is to create their own paths. We venture out on it and learn as we go. And while there are tons of great programs that teach how to SELL or even WHAT to sell... There is very little spoken about how to package an offer and what prices to use to hit your goals.

One of my clients is a doctor who thought one service was his most profitable offering. When we actually dug into the numbers, it turned out a completely different service was making him the most money. He had no clue because he never checked his numbers – it was a pain, there wasn't a good system, and nobody made him do it.

Not knowing your numbers is like trying to drive cross-country with no fuel gauge and no map. You might get there eventually, but it's going to be a stressful journey with a lot of unnecessary detours.

## The Three Financial Foundations

Before we dive into specific systems, let's establish the three foundations of business finance:

1. **Revenue Clarity** - Knowing exactly where your money comes from
2. **Expense Control** - Understanding where your money goes
3. **Profit First** - Ensuring you keep what matters most

Each of these areas needs its own simple system, and when they work together, magic happens.

Let's start with the first foundation.

## Revenue Clarity: Know Your Value (And Charge For It)

The first step toward simple finance systems is having complete clarity about your revenue. This means understanding:

- What you sell
- How much you sell it for
- How many you need to sell to reach your goals
- Where those sales come from

Sounds basic, right? Yet I've worked with six and seven-figure business owners who couldn't clearly answer these questions.

### The Mindset Shift: You Actually Are Expert Enough

Let's address the elephant in the room: most unpaid experts don't yet consider themselves expert enough to charge money.

Here's the truth: If you know more than the average person does, and you can help them do something they could not do as fast or as well as you can help them to do, then you are expert enough to charge money.

Think about it this way: If your neighbor wants you to help with his computer because he's a "technoob" and you're awesome, he might offer to send over some killer BBQ when he grills this weekend instead of paying you.

Easy deal, right? That food is going to cost him money and time, and you're okay with that. Why? Because you gave him value and you both know it.

Well... when you're giving value to a complete stranger through websites, videos, and other marketing materials, trading BBQ for your genius skills isn't going to pan out. Money is simply the currency used to exchange value.

### Being Broke Helps No One

There's another mindset shift we need to address: thinking it's noble or humble to undercharge.

Here's the harsh truth: If you don't charge properly, you will end up broke. And if you're broke, you're not going to be around to help anyone. You'll be depressed, stressed, and struggling to pay your bills.

The economy needs you to contribute! You have a serious obligation to go out there and compete for business and serve YOUR MARKET – the ones who don't want to do business with that person who may be as good or even better at what you do, but isn't worth the investment for them.

Getting paid properly is the way to feel free and happy AND it's the way to ensure you have the resources you need to continue to hone your craft and offer your products and services to the marketplace.

### The 10% Rule of Thumb

Here's a simple rule I've used with clients for years: Take the highest price you're comfortable charging and then ADD 10% to that price.

Once you start getting sales at your price, incrementally increase your price by 5-10% for every new customer you take on until you stop getting conversions.

DON'T BE THE ONE TO TELL YOURSELF NO! Let your customers tell you what they will pay.

## Value Ladders: The Strategic Framework for Sustainable Revenue

One of the most powerful revenue systems I've ever implemented – for myself and for clients – is what I call a Value Ladder.

A Value Ladder is simply a series of offers at different price points that allow customers to "ascend" from low-cost introductory products to higher-value, higher-priced offerings.

This approach has several benefits:
- It removes price as the only barrier to working with you
- It allows customers to experience value before making larger investments
- It creates multiple revenue streams for your business
- It maximizes customer lifetime value

Here's how to structure a basic Value Ladder:

### 1. Lead With Value (Free Content)

I'm a big believer in leading with value. I grow businesses in many different ways. One of them is helping entrepreneurs craft solid offers and clear their head trash so they can actually pitch them and make money.

Find a way to create something of value for your market that you can give away. Create something that complements OR supplements what you already do.

This could be a guide, a video series, a checklist, or any resource that showcases your expertise while solving a real problem for your ideal clients.

### 2. Low-Level Offer (Tripwire)

The next thing you will create to ascend them up your value ladder is a low-level offer, sometimes referred to as a tripwire.

Your low-cost product should be something that can solve ONE specific problem for them. It should be easily digestible within one to two hours and should allow them the ability to implement within a day. The price here is typically between $6-$20.

Remember to make it easily and quickly digestible and actionable! The problem you will want to solve is not so much how to give value, not if you know your stuff. It's going to be more about demonstrating the value in a product they haven't seen yet well enough to get them to part with their money.

### 3. Core Offer

The next offer is going to be your core offer. This is the one that should bring you the majority of your income. All of your marketing and products will be leading up to THIS product or service that allows you to give max benefit to max audience size.

My preference is that this is scaleable, so it's a digital product or training that's modulated and self-paced (online membership course, etc.) with possible weekly trainings, live videos, Q&A, etc. inside of a group. This lets you leverage your time while being able to serve more people at a solid price point.

### 4. Upsells

Upsells are not created to be just one more possible way to squeeze money out of a prospect. Once you've shown them value at each level, they are much more likely to want more from you and be willing to pay higher prices if you continue to offer them what they want.

Upsells are going to solve a problem that not everyone in your market needs solved, but the ones who do need it solved understand the value of it.

Keep this in mind... people that pay the least expect the most. It's harder to sell people on free and $5 than it is to sell the RIGHT person on $200 or more. The person who's focused on VALUE rather than dollars (no, they are not the same) is going to be willing to spend more.

## The Revenue Math: Simple Scenarios to $10K/Month

Let's put these concepts into action with some simple scenarios that can get you to $10,000 per month. These aren't theoretical – they're actual models my clients have used to transform their businesses.

### Scenario One: Starting Point

```
Product       | Price | Monthly Sales | Monthly Revenue
--------------|-------|---------------|----------------
Tripwire      | $5    | 750           | $3,750
Core Offer    | $20   | 150           | $3,000
Upsell 1      | $67   | 50            | $3,350
--------------|-------|---------------|----------------
Total Revenue |       |               | $10,100
```

When you're just starting and afraid to charge much, do you see how many sales you have to make to hit $10,000 a month? You need 950 total transactions!

### Scenario Two: Bump the Core Offer

```
Product       | Price | Monthly Sales | Monthly Revenue
--------------|-------|---------------|----------------
Tripwire      | $10   | 500           | $5,000
Core Offer    | $27   | 100           | $2,700
Upsell 1      | $67   | 35            | $2,345
--------------|-------|---------------|----------------
Total Revenue |       |               | $10,045
```

Here, we doubled the Tripwire cost, but it's still only $10. We bumped the Core Offer price $7 and left the upsell the same. With this offer, you need 315 FEWER "yes's" to get to $10k a month.

When you think about what's harder... getting a yes or a yes at a few bucks higher... usually it's just the "yes" that's scariest.

### Scenario Three: Add a Premium Offer

```
Product       | Price  | Monthly Sales | Monthly Revenue
--------------|--------|---------------|----------------
Tripwire      | $12    | 450           | $5,400
Core Offer    | $37    | 45            | $1,665
Upsell 1      | $97    | 10            | $970
Upsell 2      | $997   | 2             | $1,994
--------------|--------|---------------|----------------
Total Revenue |        |               | $10,029
```

This is a powerful example of what happens when you have higher ticket offers available. With only TWO sales of your premium offer, you just added nearly $2k to your monthly revenue total. Only two sales out of your 450 customers.

Think about what's harder: getting 950 sales at low prices or 507 sales with a few at higher prices?

## Expense Control: Know Where Your Money Goes

Now that we've built a system for bringing money in, let's talk about where it's going. This is often where entrepreneurs start to tune out, but stay with me – this is where the magic happens.

The first step is simple: You need to know your numbers.

### The 30-Minute Financial Clarity Process

Set aside 30 minutes each week (yes, just 30 minutes) to review:

1. **Revenue by Category** - What products/services generated income this week?
2. **Expenses by Category** - Where did money go out?
3. **Cash Flow Projection** - What's coming in and going out in the next 4 weeks?

That's it. Thirty minutes that will transform your relationship with your business finances.

I had a client who was consistently stressed about money despite making multiple six figures in revenue. When we implemented this simple 30-minute weekly review, she discovered she was spending nearly $2,000 each month on software subscriptions she barely used. That one insight paid for our entire year of working together.

### The Three Categories of Expenses

To simplify expense management, I break all business expenses into three categories:

1. **Essential Operating Expenses** - Things your business cannot function without (hosting, basic tools, rent if you have a physical location)

2. **Growth Investments** - Expenses that directly contribute to business growth (advertising, team members who generate revenue, education that improves your skills)

3. **Nice-to-Haves** - Everything else (the fancy software, additional team members who don't directly generate revenue, office upgrades)

When cash flow is tight, you know exactly which category to cut first. When revenue increases, you know which category to grow first.

### Measuring What Matters

I measure all the things that are important. Original goals that people have if I'm starting with them, so I can kind of watch how they improve and track. Some of them will be financial, but some of them will just be, you know, how many hours in the office.

One of my clients wanted to be able to not go into the office for a month or two if that's what he wants. Those are the kinds of things we track - the personal goals and values alongside the financial ones.

There's no software needed for this. It's just a simple spreadsheet that tracks the metrics that matter to YOU. What are your fan base numbers? What's your schedule like? How often are you writing or composing or creating? How often are you putting out new work?

This way, when someone says "this isn't working," we can look at the actual metrics. Not just followers or revenue, but the activities that DRIVE those results.

## Profit First: The System That Changes Everything

The final component of your simple finance system is ensuring you actually keep some of the money you make. This is where most entrepreneurs fail – they focus on revenue but forget about profit.

The system I recommend is a modified version of Mike Michalowicz's Profit First approach, adapted for solo entrepreneurs and small business owners.

Here's how it works:

### Step 1: Set Up Four Core Accounts

1. **Income Account** - All revenue comes here first
2. **Profit Account** - Your business's reward for existing
3. **Tax Account** - Because the tax man always comes
4. **Operating Expense Account** - For running the business

### Step 2: Allocate Percentages

Twice a month, move money from your Income account into the other accounts based on these percentages:
- Profit: 5% (increasing to 10% as you grow)
- Tax: 15% (adjust based on your tax situation)
- Operating Expenses: 80% (decreasing to 60% as you grow)

### Step 3: Use Your Profit

Every quarter, take 50% of what's in your Profit account as a distribution to yourself. This is your reward for building a profitable business. The other 50% stays as cash reserves for your business.

This simple system ensures three things:
1. You're building a profitable business, not just a busy one
2. You're setting aside money for taxes (avoiding the panic many entrepreneurs feel)
3. You're forcing yourself to operate within constraints, which drives innovation and efficiency

## The Long Game: Building Real Business Wealth

The people that are making money with it right now are selling the drill of "you could build an agency." In my view, the people that are going to make money with it for real are the people that build things where they turn it into a service for a certain target market, and then they go occupy that market, and then that recurring revenue multiple is real.

If you want to sell that business someday, they're just buying the cash flow. And the cash flow is real. The cash flow is built on your brand that was built on top of this software, but you went in and customized it for a specific market. Nobody else did that. And then you went and scooped up 10% of that market at a reasonable monthly price, and it's like, okay, yeah, we'll pay you. And then your stick rate is three years or whatever it is, that's what people buy it on. That's 8x in your own.

## Bringing It All Together: Your 30-Day Finance System Implementation

Let's bring this all together with a 30-day plan to implement these systems in your business.

Week 1: Revenue Clarity
- Map your current offerings and their price points
- Draft your Value Ladder (free content, tripwire, core offer, upsells)
- Calculate how many sales you need at each level to hit your income goal

Week 2: Expense Control
- Categorize all expenses from the past 3 months
- Identify expenses that can be eliminated or reduced
- Set up your 30-minute weekly financial review

Week 3: Profit First Setup
- Set up your four bank accounts
- Determine your allocation percentages
- Make your first allocation

Week 4: Optimization
- Review what's working and what's not
- Adjust prices based on market feedback
- Create your financial dashboard to track key metrics

Remember: The goal isn't perfection; it's progress. Each week you implement these systems, you're building a stronger financial foundation for your business.

## The Bottom Line: Math Is Your Friend

Changing the way you think about numbers is a POWERFUL way to change the kinds of numbers you have in your bank account each month.

You don't need to love numbers. You don't need to become an accountant. You just need simple systems that give you clarity and control.

Because when you know your numbers, you make better decisions. When you make better decisions, you make more money. When you make more money AND keep more of what you make, you create true freedom.

In the next chapter, we'll build on this financial foundation and explore Simple Time Mastery – because once you know what to charge and how to keep more of it, you need to ensure you're making the most of the hours you have.

But first, complete the exercises in this chapter. They're not just busywork – they're the practical steps that will transform your business finances.
