# Chapter Two: Simple Finance Systems - What Comes In > What Goes Out

## The Foundation of Business Freedom (Even Though You Hate Numbers)

Let me tell you something that might surprise you.

Most entrepreneurs I've worked with over the last 22 years *hate* numbers. They didn't start their business because they love spreadsheets, profit margins, or balancing books. They started because they're passionate about what they do and wanted freedom.

Yet here I am, dedicating our second chapter to finance systems.

Why? Because without getting this right, nothing else matters. You can have the most brilliant marketing, the best team, and the most optimized operations in the world – but if what comes in doesn't exceed what goes out, you're just building an expensive hobby.

I've helped several startups grow to million-dollar businesses within a year, and others to multi-million dollar companies in under three years from their inception. In every single case, mastering simple finance systems was the foundation everything else was built on.

The good news? You don't need to become an accountant. You don't need to suddenly fall in love with QuickBooks. You just need a few simple systems that give you clarity and control.

And I promise you this – when you implement what I'm about to share, you'll feel a weight lift off your shoulders that you might not even realize was there. There's a special kind of peace that comes from knowing exactly where you stand financially. I want that for you, and I know you can get there.

## Math Is Your Friend (Yes, Really)

Let me say something controversial: Math is your friend.

I know – most entrepreneurs would rather do almost anything than crunch numbers. But here's the thing: numbers don't lie. They tell you exactly what's working and what isn't.

The goal isn't to become obsessed with every penny. The goal is to have enough awareness of your numbers that you can make confident decisions and sleep at night knowing exactly where you stand.

Let me share a story about Maria. She came to me with a successful coaching business – about $15,000 a month in revenue – but constantly felt strapped for cash. She was working all the time, worried about paying her bills, and couldn't figure out where all the money was going.

I asked her a simple question: "What's your profit margin?"

Her response: "My what?"

This is someone who was brilliant at coaching, had transformed hundreds of lives, but had no idea if she was actually making money or just spinning her wheels really fast.

When we implemented the systems I'm about to show you, she discovered she was actually losing money on one of her key programs – the one she was pouring most of her energy into. Just by identifying that and making adjustments, she added $4,000 of pure profit to her business within 30 days.

Most entrepreneurs get started because they are unsatisfied with the status quo in some way or another and find the only solution is to create their own paths. We venture out on it and learn as we go. And while there are tons of great programs that teach how to SELL or even WHAT to sell... There is very little spoken about how to package an offer and what prices to use to hit your goals.

One of my clients is a doctor who thought one service was his most profitable offering. When we actually dug into the numbers, it turned out a completely different service was making him the most money. He had no clue because he never checked his numbers – it was a pain, there wasn't a good system, and nobody made him do it.

But you know what happened when he finally understood his numbers? He was able to focus more on the truly profitable service, delegate or eliminate the less profitable ones, and within six months, he had doubled his income while working 10 fewer hours each week.

Not knowing your numbers is like trying to drive cross-country with no fuel gauge and no map. You might get there eventually, but it's going to be a stressful journey with a lot of unnecessary detours.

I believe in you. I believe you're smart enough to understand the simple math we're going to cover here. And I believe implementing these systems will transform your business and your life.

## The Three Financial Foundations

Before we dive into specific systems, let's establish the three foundations of business finance:

1. **Revenue Clarity** - Knowing exactly where your money comes from
2. **Expense Control** - Understanding where your money goes
3. **Profit First** - Ensuring you keep what matters most

Each of these areas needs its own simple system, and when they work together, magic happens.

Let's start with the first foundation.

## Revenue Clarity: Know Your Value (And Charge For It)

The first step toward simple finance systems is having complete clarity about your revenue. This means understanding:

- What you sell
- How much you sell it for
- How many you need to sell to reach your goals
- Where those sales come from

Sounds basic, right? Yet I've worked with six and seven-figure business owners who couldn't clearly answer these questions.

Let me introduce you to Michael. He was a brilliant web designer who was constantly working yet never seemed to have enough money. When we mapped out his revenue, we discovered he was charging just $500 for websites that took him 30+ hours to complete.

"But that's what everyone charges," he told me.

"Everyone who's broke, you mean?" I replied.

That conversation was uncomfortable. But it was necessary. Within six months, Michael had raised his prices to $3,500 per website, was working with better clients who valued his expertise, and was making three times the income while building fewer websites.

The transformation wasn't just financial – his entire demeanor changed. He walked taller. He spoke with more confidence. He no longer felt the need to apologize for his rates or justify his worth.

I want that transformation for you too. And it starts with getting clear on your value.

### The Mindset Shift: You Actually Are Expert Enough

Let's address the elephant in the room: most unpaid experts don't yet consider themselves expert enough to charge money.

Here's the truth: If you know more than the average person does, and you can help them do something they could not do as fast or as well as you can help them to do, then you are expert enough to charge money. Period.

Think about it this way: If your neighbor wants you to help with his computer because he's a "technoob" and you're awesome, he might offer to send over some killer BBQ when he grills this weekend instead of paying you.

Easy deal, right? That food is going to cost him money and time, and you're okay with that. Why? Because you gave him value and you both know it.

Well... when you're giving value to a complete stranger through websites, videos, and other marketing materials, trading BBQ for your genius skills isn't going to pan out. Money is simply the currency used to exchange value.

I worked with a health coach named Sarah who had incredible knowledge about hormone balance and nutrition. She'd transformed her own health and helped dozens of friends – all for free. When I suggested she charge $1,500 for a three-month program, she nearly fainted.

"But I'm not a doctor! I don't have fancy credentials!" she protested.

"Do you get results for people?" I asked.

"Well, yes..."

"Better or faster results than they'd get on their own?"

"Definitely."

"Then you have value, and value deserves compensation."

She reluctantly agreed to try charging just three people at that rate. The results? All three signed up without hesitation. One even said, "Honestly, I was surprised you weren't charging more. I would have paid twice this."

The point isn't that you should overcharge. The point is that you're probably dramatically UNDERCHARGING right now.

And here's what I want you to really internalize: When you charge appropriately for your value, you actually serve people BETTER. You show up more fully. You hold them more accountable. You create better results. Everyone wins.

### Being Broke Helps No One

There's another mindset shift we need to address: thinking it's noble or humble to undercharge.

Here's the harsh truth: If you don't charge properly, you will end up broke. And if you're broke, you're not going to be around to help anyone. You'll be depressed, stressed, and struggling to pay your bills.

The economy needs you to contribute! You have a serious obligation to go out there and compete for business and serve YOUR MARKET – the ones who don't want to do business with that person who may be as good or even better at what you do, but isn't worth the investment for them.

I worked with a therapist who was charging $65 per session because she wanted to "help people who couldn't afford therapy." Noble intention, right?

The problem? She was seeing 30+ clients a week to make ends meet and was completely burned out. She was snippy with clients. She forgot important details between sessions. She was providing mediocre service to a lot of people rather than transformative service to fewer people.

When we restructured her practice to charge $150 per session (still well below market for her specialty), she was able to reduce to 15 clients per week. She had more energy. She was more present. She created better results. And – here's the beautiful part – she set aside five slots for sliding scale payments for those truly in need.

The result? She made more money, helped her full-paying clients more effectively, AND was able to truly help those in financial need in a sustainable way.

Getting paid properly is the way to feel free and happy AND it's the way to ensure you have the resources you need to continue to hone your craft and offer your products and services to the marketplace.

I believe in you. I believe in your worth. And I believe that charging appropriately isn't just good for you – it's good for everyone you serve.

### The 10% Rule of Thumb

Here's a simple rule I've used with clients for years: Take the highest price you're comfortable charging and then ADD 10% to that price.

Why? Because the highest price you're comfortable with is almost certainly too low.

Once you start getting sales at your price, incrementally increase your price by 5-10% for every new customer you take on until you stop getting conversions.

DON'T BE THE ONE TO TELL YOURSELF NO! Let your customers tell you what they will pay.

I worked with a consultant who was charging $2,000 for a package he thought was already premium priced. I convinced him to try $2,200 (a 10% increase). No pushback at all from clients. We went to $2,500. Still no resistance. $3,000? Same result. 

It wasn't until we hit $4,500 that he started getting some price resistance – and even then, about 50% of prospects still said yes! His income more than doubled just from this one adjustment.

Here's what I want you to really hear: You are almost certainly leaving money on the table right now. Money that could fund your freedom, your family's security, your ability to serve even more effectively.

And if you're thinking, "But Tina, my market can't afford higher prices," I want to challenge that assumption. In most cases, it's not that they can't afford it – it's that you haven't demonstrated enough value to justify it. And often, that's because YOU don't believe in your own value enough yet.

I'm here to tell you: You are worth it. Your expertise is valuable. And there are people out there right now who would gladly pay what you're worth if only you'd give them the chance.

## Value Ladders: The Strategic Framework for Sustainable Revenue

One of the most powerful revenue systems I've ever implemented – for myself and for clients – is what I call a Value Ladder.

A Value Ladder is simply a series of offers at different price points that allow customers to "ascend" from low-cost introductory products to higher-value, higher-priced offerings.

This approach has several benefits:
- It removes price as the only barrier to working with you
- It allows customers to experience value before making larger investments
- It creates multiple revenue streams for your business
- It maximizes customer lifetime value

Let me share a real example from my own business. I've built a Value Ladder that looks like this:

- **Free Content:** My YouTube videos and blog posts about business systems
- **Low-Cost Tripwire:** "Projects in a Box" – pre-mapped project templates for multiple business scenarios to help the "organizationally challenged" get organized fast ($17 per template)
- **Core Offer:** My Freedom Systems – a membership site teaching people time management and business systems ($97)
- **Upsell 1:** Group Coaching ($199/month or $999 for 6 months)
- **Upsell 2:** Business Consultation Call ($299 for 90-120 minutes)
- **Premium Offer:** Retainer client agreement where clients get weekly calls with me to optimize their business ($2,500-$10,000 a month)

Each level solves a specific problem and provides a specific type of value. And each level feeds the next – my free content generates tripwire customers, who then become core offer customers, and so on.

Now, let's build your Value Ladder together.

### 1. Lead With Value (Free Content)

I'm a big believer in leading with value. I grow businesses in many different ways. One of them is helping entrepreneurs craft solid offers and clear their head trash so they can actually pitch them and make money.

Find a way to create something of value for your market that you can give away. Create something that complements OR supplements what you already do.

This could be a guide, a video series, a checklist, or any resource that showcases your expertise while solving a real problem for your ideal clients.

I worked with a real estate agent who created a free "First-Time Home Buyer's Checklist" that covered everything from improving credit scores to understanding closing costs. This simple PDF generated more qualified leads than her $3,000 monthly ad spend! Why? Because it demonstrated her expertise and genuine desire to help.

Your free content should be good enough that people would pay for it. That's the standard. It should be so valuable that people think, "If this is what she gives away, imagine what her paid stuff must be like!"

What expertise do you have that you could package into a genuinely helpful free resource? Don't overthink this – it's often the simplest things that have the biggest impact.

### 2. Low-Level Offer (Tripwire)

The next thing you will create to ascend them up your value ladder is a low-level offer, sometimes referred to as a tripwire.

Your low-cost product should be something that can solve ONE specific problem for them. It should be easily digestible within one to two hours and should allow them the ability to implement within a day. The price here is typically between $6-$20.

I worked with a fitness coach whose free content was a "7-Day Sugar Detox Guide." Her tripwire? A $12 "Sugar-Free Recipe Book" with 30 delicious recipes that complemented the detox guide. It converted at 15% – meaning for every 100 people who downloaded the free guide, 15 purchased the recipe book.

The beauty of a tripwire is that it converts a prospect into a customer – and psychologically, that's a huge shift. Once someone has purchased from you once, they're much more likely to purchase from you again.

Remember to make it easily and quickly digestible and actionable! The problem you will want to solve is not so much how to give value, not if you know your stuff. It's going to be more about demonstrating the value in a product they haven't seen yet well enough to get them to part with their money.

Your tripwire should be a no-brainer purchase. It should solve a specific pain point so well that the prospect thinks, "Of course I'll spend $10 on this – it would take me hours to figure this out on my own."

What small problem could you solve for your audience that they'd happily pay $10-20 to have solved?

### 3. Core Offer

The next offer is going to be your core offer. This is the one that should bring you the majority of your income. All of your marketing and products will be leading up to THIS product or service that allows you to give max benefit to max audience size.

My preference is that this is scaleable, so it's a digital product or training that's modulated and self-paced (online membership course, etc.) with possible weekly trainings, live videos, Q&A, etc. inside of a group. This lets you leverage your time while being able to serve more people at a solid price point.

I worked with a language teacher who had been doing one-on-one lessons for years. She was maxed out at 20 students a week and couldn't grow her income further. We created a core offer – a $97 monthly membership that included weekly group lessons, a curriculum library, and a community forum.

Within six months, she had 103 members, generating over $10,000 monthly with LESS time investment than her one-on-one teaching had required.

Your core offer should be comprehensive enough to create significant transformation but structured in a way that doesn't require all of your personal time to deliver. This is where you start to create real leverage in your business.

What solution could you package into a core offer that would serve many people simultaneously?

### 4. Upsells

Upsells are not created to be just one more possible way to squeeze money out of a prospect. Once you've shown them value at each level, they are much more likely to want more from you and be willing to pay higher prices if you continue to offer them what they want.

Upsells are going to solve a problem that not everyone in your market needs solved, but the ones who do need it solved understand the value of it.

I had a client who sold a $197 course on organic gardening (his core offer). His upsell? A $47/month "Seasons Club" where members received monthly seed packages and personalized growing calendars based on their specific climate zone. Only about 20% of his course customers joined the club – but those who did stayed members for an average of 14 months.

Another clever approach I've seen work well is offering payment plans that actually increase the total price. A few years back, Digital Marketer did a study that found that they could charge THREE times the price if they divided that price into three payments, and it converted almost as well, only a 2% difference in conversion rate. Instead of charging $97 one-time, they charged three payments of $97 and only lost 2% of sales.

Keep this in mind... people that pay the least expect the most. It's harder to sell people on free and $5 than it is to sell the RIGHT person on $200 or more. The person who's focused on VALUE rather than dollars (no, they are not the same) is going to be willing to spend more.

What additional value could you offer to those clients who want even more from you? What problem might only 10-20% of your audience have that you could solve at a premium price?

## The Three Tiers Approach for Service Businesses

If you're primarily a service provider (coach, consultant, designer, etc.), here's another framework that has worked incredibly well for my clients. I call it the Three Tiers Approach.

Here's how it works:

### Tier 1: High-End (10% of Clients)
This is your premium, high-touch offering. It's the highest price point, and it should be the highest value. You won't serve many clients here, but they'll pay significantly more.

The high level tier is higher money, higher effective hourly rate, but also higher level energy coming back from your clients. When you work with high level people, they teach you as much as you teach them. You learn from them. It's also higher energy and just higher value.

The high-level group is needed because you need to have that high energy, you need to have that high earning power. You also want to have high-level connections in case you ever need it in the world, but also be a high-level connection yourself.

### Tier 2: Mid-Range (60-70% of Clients)
This is your "sweet spot" offering – the one that most of your clients will choose. It's moderately priced and delivers excellent value while still being scalable.

This is the impact-making group. This is where you make a difference in the world, the greatest difference in the world. These are the most influential, influence-able group of people that you're going to be working with that need you the most. They're most primed because they have the money, because they have the understanding, because they have the ability and the willingness to act upon what you're doing.

They also give a significant enough amount of money that we're earning from them and they help fuel our lives and what we're doing in our business, but they're also the bigger pool where we get feedback because it's hybrid coaching. We're getting some feedback in real time on what we're doing and so it's the biggest feedback loop that we're going to get about how our stuff is working in the marketplace, how what we're teaching is helping people or not helping, what we need to do to improve what we're doing.

### Tier 3: Entry-Level (20-30% of Clients)
This is your most accessible offering – the one that allows people to experience your value at a lower price point. It should require minimal personal time from you but still deliver real value.

This is kind of our give back, but it's also the most scalable, it's the most hands-off. So it doesn't cost a lot, and anybody that wants it can probably afford it by skipping McDonald's once or twice a week. If they need a leg up, this is where they're going to get it from, but it doesn't take a lot out of us, because once we build it, it's done. It doesn't require a lot from us, but it does give a lot because they're getting essentially almost all the knowledge, at least all the knowledge that they're going to be able to use anyway because of what we've already predefined that they're able to do.

Everything that you do to serve your high level clients should come down. So you create the things that you need to really support your high level clients. And that becomes something productized for each of the lower tiers. And so there's not multiple efforts, but there's three levels of entry points, three levels of earning power, three levels of energy.

I've implemented this Three Tiers Approach with lawyers, coaches, consultants, designers, and even healthcare providers. It works across industries because it's based on human psychology and basic business principles.

What would your three tiers look like? What would you offer at each level? How would you ensure each delivers appropriate value for the price point?

## The Revenue Math: Simple Scenarios to $10K/Month

Let's put these concepts into action with some simple scenarios that can get you to $10,000 per month. These aren't theoretical – they're actual models my clients have used to transform their businesses.

### Scenario One: Starting Point

```
Product       | Price | Monthly Sales | Monthly Revenue
--------------|-------|---------------|----------------
Tripwire      | $5    | 750           | $3,750
Core Offer    | $20   | 150           | $3,000
Upsell 1      | $67   | 50            | $3,350
--------------|-------|---------------|----------------
Total Revenue |       |               | $10,100
```

When you're just starting and afraid to charge much, do you see how many sales you have to make to hit $10,000 a month? You need 950 total transactions!

Ask yourself: is it harder to charge more and get fewer people to say yes, or to charge less and get more people to say yes?

I had a client selling a $7 eBook who needed to sell over 1,400 copies each month to hit his income goals. He was spending all his time on marketing and fulfillment, constantly hustling for the next sale. When we repositioned his knowledge into a $47 course and a $197 implementation program, he was able to hit the same income goal with just 85 total sales per month.

Let's look at how small price increases can dramatically change the math.

### Scenario Two: Bump the Core Offer

```
Product       | Price | Monthly Sales | Monthly Revenue
--------------|-------|---------------|----------------
Tripwire      | $10   | 500           | $5,000
Core Offer    | $27   | 100           | $2,700
Upsell 1      | $67   | 35            | $2,345
--------------|-------|---------------|----------------
Total Revenue |       |               | $10,045
```

Here, we doubled the Tripwire cost, but it's still only $10. We bumped the Core Offer price $7 and left the upsell the same. With this offer, you need 315 FEWER "yes's" to get to $10k a month.

When you think about what's harder... getting a yes or a yes at a few bucks higher... usually it's just the "yes" that's scariest.

I told you earlier – math is your friend!

### Scenario Three: Bump in Price + Conversion

```
Product       | Price | Monthly Sales | Monthly Revenue
--------------|-------|---------------|----------------
Tripwire      | $12   | 475           | $5,700
Core Offer    | $37   | 75            | $2,775
Upsell 1      | $67   | 25            | $1,675
--------------|-------|---------------|----------------
Total Revenue |       |               | $10,150
```

Again... just a few tweaks to the price and now we need even fewer sales to hit that number. Something to think about is the percentage of conversions that take the offer. The higher you can increase your conversion rate from TripWire to Core Offer to Upsell, the more sales you get, the higher value each of your new customer becomes.

### Scenario Four: Add a Premium Offer

```
Product       | Price  | Monthly Sales | Monthly Revenue
--------------|--------|---------------|----------------
Tripwire      | $12    | 450           | $5,400
Core Offer    | $37    | 45            | $1,665
Upsell 1      | $97    | 10            | $970
Upsell 2      | $997   | 2             | $1,994
--------------|--------|---------------|----------------
Total Revenue |        |               | $10,029
```

This is a powerful example of what happens when you have higher ticket offers available. With only TWO sales of your premium offer, you just added nearly $2k to your monthly revenue total. See how fast that can add up? Only two sales out of your 450 customers.

EXCITING, ISN'T IT? Bet you want to call up your old math teacher and thank them!

### Scenario Five: Double the Upsell Price

```
Product       | Price  | Monthly Sales | Monthly Revenue
--------------|--------|---------------|----------------
Tripwire      | $12    | 300           | $3,600
Core Offer    | $57    | 40            | $2,280
Upsell 1      | $197   | 15            | $2,955
Upsell 2      | $997   | 1             | $997
--------------|--------|---------------|----------------
Total Revenue |        |               | $9,832
```

Here we upped the Core offer by $20 and doubled the upsell price. Remember, these are mock scenarios just to give you an visual idea of what happens when just a few numbers change.

I had a client who was afraid to raise his upsell price from $97 to $197 because "no one would pay that much." When he finally tried it, not only did his conversion rate stay almost identical, but he was able to add more bonuses and content to the offer, which actually INCREASED the conversion rate. His monthly revenue jumped by $3,000 with that one change.

### Scenario Six: Tripped Up

```
Product       | Price  | Monthly Sales | Monthly Revenue
--------------|--------|---------------|----------------
Tripwire      | $20    | 275           | $5,500
Core Offer    | $67    | 40            | $2,680
Upsell 1      | $197   | 5             | $985
Upsell 2      | $997   | 1             | $997
--------------|--------|---------------|----------------
Total Revenue |        |               | $10,162
```

Upped that Tripwire and BOOM. More revenue with fewer sales. The beauty of increasing your tripwire price is that it often doesn't affect conversion rates significantly if the value is clearly demonstrated.

### Scenario Seven: More Please

```
Product       | Price  | Monthly Sales | Monthly Revenue
--------------|--------|---------------|----------------
Tripwire      | $20    | 500           | $10,000
Core Offer    | $47    | 50            | $2,350
Upsell 1      | $147   | 10            | $1,470
Upsell 2      | $497   | 1             | $497
--------------|--------|---------------|----------------
Total Revenue |        |               | $14,317
```

Want to earn more than $10k a month? Getting those $20 sales on automation isn't that hard with a good content or ad strategy. Even with a ten percent conversion rate on upsells, the profits look pretty nice.

One thing that's important to consider is making sure that your tripwire cost balances out your ad budget. Work on your conversion rate and prices so that you break even on any ad costs with tripwire sales.

In other words... If it costs you $2 for a new lead and your tripwire is $20, you need to convert every tenth lead into a customer to break even. Or... lower your lead cost. Or... raise your tripwire cost... but that could hurt you if you go above $20 depending on your market.

If you've served them well with your free offer, you may be able to get more.

I once worked with a coach who was spending $4 per lead on Facebook ads. His tripwire was only $7, and only converting at about 5% – so he was losing money on every new customer! When we improved his tripwire offer and raised the price to $27, suddenly his ads became profitable, and his business transformed.

## Expense Control: Know Where Your Money Goes

Now that we've built a system for bringing money in, let's talk about where it's going. This is often where entrepreneurs start to tune out, but stay with me – this is where the magic happens.

The first step is simple: You need to know your numbers.

I had a client who came to me frustrated because, despite making $20,000 a month in her business, she never had enough money to pay herself more than $3,000. When we looked at her expenses, we found:

- $4,800/month on online tools and software (most of which she barely used)
- $2,500/month on a virtual assistant who wasn't clearly tasked
- $1,500/month on office space she visited twice a month
- $3,200/month on ads that weren't being properly tracked or optimized

That's $12,000 in expenses that weren't strategically contributing to growth! By rationalizing these expenses, she was able to immediately increase her personal income to $8,000 while investing the remaining $4,000 into growth initiatives that actually generated returns.

Your business exists to serve your life, not the other way around. Every dollar your business spends should be intentional and evaluated for its return on investment – whether that return is financial, time-saving, or genuinely enhancing your quality of life.

### The 30-Minute Financial Clarity Process

Set aside 30 minutes each week (yes, just 30 minutes) to review:

1. **Revenue by Category** - What products/services generated income this week?
2. **Expenses by Category** - Where did money go out?
3. **Cash Flow Projection** - What's coming in and going out in the next 4 weeks?

That's it. Thirty minutes that will transform your relationship with your business finances.

I had a client who was consistently stressed about money despite making multiple six figures in revenue. When we implemented this simple 30-minute weekly review, she discovered she was spending nearly $2,000 each month on software subscriptions she barely used. That one insight paid for our entire year of working together.

Another client realized during his weekly review that a particular marketing channel was generating 80% of his qualified leads – but he was splitting his ad budget equally across four channels. By reallocating his budget, he doubled his qualified leads without increasing spending.

The magic of this weekly review isn't just in the specific insights – it's in the awareness and relationship with money it creates. When you regularly look at your numbers, they become less intimidating. You start to see patterns. You make better decisions intuitively.

And perhaps most importantly, you gain peace of mind. There's nothing quite like the confidence that comes from knowing exactly where you stand financially.

### The Three Categories of Expenses

To simplify expense management, I break all business expenses into three categories:

1. **Essential Operating Expenses** - Things your business cannot function without (hosting, basic tools, rent if you have a physical location)

2. **Growth Investments** - Expenses that directly contribute to business growth (advertising, team members who generate revenue, education that improves your skills)

3. **Nice-to-Haves** - Everything else (the fancy software, additional team members who don't directly generate revenue, office upgrades)

When cash flow is tight, you know exactly which category to cut first. When revenue increases, you know which category to grow first.

I worked with a business owner who was about to let go of her only support staff person to reduce expenses during a temporary cash crunch. When we categorized her expenses, we realized that her team member was actually essential to revenue generation, while her office space was a "nice-to-have." She gave up the office, worked from home for six months, kept her team member, and was able to maintain her revenue through the rough patch.

The way you categorize expenses might differ from another business. A physical retail shop needs a location – that's an essential expense. For an online coach, an office might be entirely in the "nice-to-have" category. The key is being honest about what's truly driving your business forward versus what's just nice to have.

### The Profit-Driven Expense Audit

Once a quarter, I want you to conduct a more thorough review of all expenses – what I call a Profit-Driven Expense Audit. Here's how it works:

1. **List all recurring expenses** - Subscription services, staff, rent, etc.
2. **For each expense, answer these questions**:
   - Does this directly contribute to revenue generation?
   - Is there a less expensive alternative that would work just as well?
   - What would happen if I eliminated this expense entirely?
3. **Identify at least three expenses to eliminate or reduce**
4. **Take immediate action** on those three items

I once helped a client conduct this audit, and we discovered she was paying $300/month for an email marketing platform with advanced features she never used. By switching to a simpler option at $50/month, she saved $3,000 annually – money she redirected to Facebook ads that generated $27,000 in new business.

Another client discovered he was paying $1,200 monthly for SEO services that hadn't generated a single lead in six months. By eliminating that expense and investing half of it in creating high-quality content in-house, he saw better results within 60 days.

The goal isn't to slash expenses mindlessly. The goal is to ensure every dollar you spend is intentional and generating appropriate returns.

### Measuring What Matters

I measure all the things that are important. Original goals that people have if I'm starting with them, so I can kind of watch how they improve and track. Some of them will be financial, but some of them will just be, you know, how many hours in the office.

One of my clients wanted to be able to not go into the office for a month or two if that's what he wants. Those are the kinds of things we track - the personal goals and values alongside the financial ones.

There's no software needed for this. It's just a simple spreadsheet that tracks the metrics that matter to YOU. What are your fan base numbers? What's your schedule like? How often are you writing or composing or creating? How often are you putting out new work?

This way, when someone says "this isn't working," we can look at the actual metrics. Not just followers or revenue, but the activities that DRIVE those results.

I had a client – a voice coach and musician who hated numbers and all administrative things (I have yet to meet a business owner who actually likes that stuff). She trusted me and did this exercise.

When she finally completed it, she immediately saw how she could reach her goals exponentially faster. She wanted to buy a ranch to foster children and teach music, and she got there THREE YEARS earlier than she had planned. I just got the sweetest message from her on my birthday – a video of her on the ranch inviting me to visit.

That's the power of tracking what truly matters to you, not just what traditional business metrics say you should track.

## Profit First: The System That Changes Everything

The final component of your simple finance system is ensuring you actually keep some of the money you make. This is where most entrepreneurs fail – they focus on revenue but forget about profit.

I was working with Mark, an eight-figure business owner. He wants significant growth, but what he wants most is freedom. The kind of growth he envisions would require more management than he wants to put in.

I told him, "That's okay, but you have to be aware there's a disconnect. Pick the thing you want most."

What he wants most is not having to show up at the office when he doesn't want to. So I said, "Then you have to be okay with the 80/20 rule. That 20% of the time you're not there, a lot of stuff just won't be optimized and working the way it should."

The business is still incredibly profitable and gives him everything else he wants except for that massive level of success he sometimes thinks about. He has to accept the trade-off – he's not getting to the absolute highest level of accomplishment, but he has freedom and happiness most people will never have.

This is what clarifying your financial goals does: it helps you make conscious trade-offs instead of unconscious ones.

The system I recommend is a modified version of Mike Michalowicz's Profit First approach, adapted for solo entrepreneurs and small business owners.

Here's how it works:

### Step 1: Set Up Four Core Accounts

1. **Income Account** - All revenue comes here first
2. **Profit Account** - Your business's reward for existing
3. **Tax Account** - Because the tax man always comes
4. **Operating Expense Account** - For running the business

These can be separate bank accounts, or if you're just starting, separate tracking in your accounting software.

### Step 2: Allocate Percentages

Twice a month, move money from your Income account into the other accounts based on these percentages:
- Profit: 5% (increasing to 10% as you grow)
- Tax: 15% (adjust based on your tax situation)
- Operating Expenses: 80% (decreasing to 60% as you grow)

I worked with a solo consultant who implemented this system when she was making just $4,000/month. Even allocating just 5% to profit seemed impossible to her, but she committed to it. 

The first few months were tight as she learned to operate on slightly less. But forcing herself to work within those constraints led to better decisions. She raised her rates. She stopped taking clients who weren't ideal. She eliminated unnecessary expenses.

Six months later, she had $4,800 in her profit account – money she would have otherwise spent without thinking. She took half as a distribution to herself (a nice weekend getaway) and kept half as reserves. More importantly, her monthly revenue had increased to $7,000 because the constraints forced her to make better business decisions.

### Step 3: Use Your Profit

Every quarter, take 50% of what's in your Profit account as a distribution to yourself. This is your reward for building a profitable business. The other 50% stays as cash reserves for your business.

This is critical. The profit distribution isn't meant to be reinvested in the business. It's meant to be a reward for you – the business owner. Take a trip. Buy something special. Do something that reminds you why you started this business in the first place.

This simple system ensures three things:
1. You're building a profitable business, not just a busy one
2. You're setting aside money for taxes (avoiding the panic many entrepreneurs feel)
3. You're forcing yourself to operate within constraints, which drives innovation and efficiency

I've seen this system transform businesses across industries – from e-commerce to consulting to brick-and-mortar retail. The key is consistency. Even when it feels tight, stick with the allocations. Your business will adapt to what's available, and you'll make better decisions as a result.

## The Long Game: Building Real Business Wealth

The people that are making money with it right now are selling the drill of "you could build an agency." In my view, the people that are going to make money with it for real are the people that build things where they turn it into a service for a certain target market, and then they go occupy that market, and then that recurring revenue multiple is real.

If you want to sell that business someday, they're just buying the cash flow. And the cash flow is real. The cash flow is built on your brand that was built on top of this software, but you went in and customized it for a specific market. Nobody else did that. And then you went and scooped up 10% of that market at a reasonable monthly price, and it's like, okay, yeah, we'll pay you. And then your stick rate is three years or whatever it is, that's what people buy it on. That's 8x in your own.

Let me share a story about long-term thinking. I worked with a client who built a simple software tool for real estate agents. It wasn't revolutionary – it just made a common task easier. He charged $37/month, built up to 300 subscribers over two years, and then sold the business for $336,000 (8x annual profit).

The buyer wasn't purchasing his coding skills. They were purchasing the reliable, predictable cash flow his business generated. They were purchasing the relationships he'd built with those 300 real estate agents. They were purchasing the reputation and the systems.

This approach to building business wealth is available to you too, regardless of your industry. The key is creating systems that:

1. Generate recurring revenue
2. Solve a specific problem for a specific market
3. Can run without requiring all your personal time
4. Build a valuable asset (your customer list, your methods, your intellectual property)

When you implement the finance systems we've discussed in this chapter, you're not just improving today's cash flow – you're building tomorrow's wealth.

I believe you can do this. I believe you deserve to create not just income, but lasting wealth. And I believe the systems in this chapter are your path to get there.

## Bringing It All Together: Your 30-Day Finance System Implementation

Let's bring this all together with a 30-day plan to implement these systems in your business.

Week 1: Revenue Clarity
- Map your current offerings and their price points
- Draft your Value Ladder (free content, tripwire, core offer, upsells)
- Calculate how many sales you need at each level to hit your income goal

Week 2: Expense Control
- Categorize all expenses from the past 3 months
- Identify expenses that can be eliminated or reduced
- Set up your 30-minute weekly financial review

Week 3: Profit First Setup
- Set up your four bank accounts
- Determine your allocation percentages
- Make your first allocation

Week 4: Optimization
- Review what's working and what's not
- Adjust prices based on market feedback
- Create your financial dashboard to track key metrics

I had a client complete this exact 30-day implementation plan last year. She'd been in business for three years and was making about $5,000 monthly but constantly stressed about money.

After Week 1, she realized her core offer was underpriced by at least 30% and created a new high-ticket option.
After Week 2, she eliminated $1,200 in monthly expenses that weren't serving her business.
After Week 3, she had her first-ever profit allocation – a modest $250, but it represented a profound shift in her business mindset.
After Week 4, she had complete clarity on her numbers and a plan to double her income within six months.

And she did it. Six months later, she was consistently at $10,000+ monthly and taking home more than twice what she had been previously.

Remember: The goal isn't perfection; it's progress. Each week you implement these systems, you're building a stronger financial foundation for your business.

You can do this. I believe in you. And I'm so excited to see how transforming your relationship with your business finances will change everything else in your business too.

## The Bottom Line: Math Is Your Friend

Changing the way you think about numbers is a POWERFUL way to change the kinds of numbers you have in your bank account each month.

You don't need to love numbers. You don't need to become an accountant. You just need simple systems that give you clarity and control.

Because when you know your numbers, you make better decisions. When you make better decisions, you make more money. When you make more money AND keep more of what you make, you create true freedom.

I've seen these systems transform businesses and lives over and over again. I've seen entrepreneurs go from constantly stressed about money to completely confident about their finances. I've seen people reach their financial goals years ahead of schedule because they implemented these simple but powerful systems.

And I believe you can do it too. 

In the next chapter, we'll build on this financial foundation and explore Simple Time Mastery – because once you know what to charge and how to keep more of it, you need to ensure you're making the most of the hours you have.

But first, complete the exercises in this chapter. They're not just busywork – they're the practical steps that will transform your business finances.
