# Chapter One: Principles and Priorities - Start by Defining What Matters Most

## Why This Chapter Comes First (And Why Nobody Initially Cares)

Let me start with something that might surprise you. 

Nobody cares about transforming their priorities. I mean it.

When I was creating a lead magnet about principles and priorities, I had ChatGPT write a headline: "The Surprising Key to Unlocking Your Business Potential: How Core Values Transform Your Priorities."

I laughed out loud and said, "Nobody cares about transforming their priorities! That's not good at all."

What people *actually* care about is getting traction and momentum in their business when they feel stuck. They care about making more money without working themselves to death. They care about spending more time with their kids while still hitting their business goals.

So why is this chapter first? Why am I talking about principles and priorities when nobody explicitly wants to transform them?

Because principles and values inform priorities, and priorities inform what gets done and what gets measured. And that obviously informs what we actually have in our lives and businesses.

This is the foundation everything else builds on. Skip this step, and you'll work twice as hard for half the results.

## The Big Rocks First (Or Why Your Jar Is Always Full)

There's a presentation you might have seen before. The presenter has a jar and next to it are big rocks, smaller pebbles, sand, and water. He asks, "Can you fit all of this into the jar?"

People try different approaches, but most fail. Then the presenter shows the right way: put the big rocks in first, then the smaller rocks, then the sand, and finally the water. Everything fits.

The moral? If you don't put the big rocks in first – your true priorities – you'll never fit them in later.

This is where the business concept of "big rocks" comes from. It's what matters most, what you start with. Because even if some stuff doesn't make it into your jar at the end of the day (and let's be real, something always gets left out), you've handled what truly matters.

But here's the million-dollar question: How do you know what your big rocks are? How do you decide what truly matters most?

That's where principles and values come in.

## Discovering What Actually Matters (Not Just What You Don't Want)

One of the biggest issues I see when working with clients is this:

They show up to meetings talking about the same tasks week after week that never get done. When asked why, they never say, "I wasn't working." Of course they were working! They were busy all week.

"I did this instead. I did that instead," they tell me.

So I ask, "Why didn't you do the thing we agreed was most important?"

And the honest answer? "Because it wasn't a clear enough priority for me to know that's what I had to be working on."

This happens because we haven't established values. Even when you're one person working in your business alone, you'll often sit there thinking, "What do I do today? What do I need to work on?"

But if you've established that you need to work on X because X will give you specific results, and Y and Z can't really be done well until X is done, then you're crystal clear that X has to be done first. It's the cornerstone of everything else.

The problem? Most people can't tell me what does matter to them. Instead, they can tell me what they DON'T want:

"I don't want to work after six o'clock."
"I don't want to deal with bad clients."
"I don't want to do my taxes."

Knowing what you don't want is a start, but it's not enough. You need to know what you actively DO want.

## Your Values Are Your Decision-Making Framework

Here's where things get practical. Your values aren't just fluffy concepts – they're your decision-making framework for EVERYTHING in your business.

I had a client who's an eight-figure business owner. He wants significant growth, but what he wants most is freedom. The kind of growth he envisions would require more management than he wants to put in.

I told him, "That's okay, but you have to be aware there's a disconnect. Pick the thing you want most."

What he wants most is not having to show up at the office when he doesn't want to. So I said, "Then you have to be okay with the 80/20 rule. That 20% of the time you're not there, a lot of stuff just won't be optimized and working the way it should."

The business is still incredibly profitable and gives him everything else he wants except for that massive level of success he sometimes thinks about. He has to accept the trade-off – he's not getting to the absolute highest level of accomplishment, but he has freedom and happiness most people will never have.

That's what clarifying your values does: it helps you make conscious trade-offs instead of unconscious ones.

## Values Shift Until They Lock

One thing to understand about values is that they shift over time – until they don't.

I worked with Dan Meredith years ago when he was copywriting and running his gym. He did everything in notebooks back then, and I think he didn't define his values clearly at the beginning. So we had many conversations about defining values and then sticking to them.

His values were shifting at that time, which is normal. Values do shift generally until you lock into your real core values. Then they rarely change fundamentally.

There's a point in most people's lives where their values are shifting, shifting, shifting – until they lock in. Then they become your north star.

The conversations I had with Dan were about: 
- Be clear about what you want
- Be honest about what you want
- Be aware of how you're sabotaging opportunities to get what you want
- Stay focused
- Stop trying to please everybody

I'd tell him, "Don't say you want to be a business owner and then also want to go play and do all these other things. Which one matters most? If play matters most, be honest about that and go do it. But don't act like you're a business owner who cares deeply about the business."

## Compatible Values Create Freedom

Working with people whose values align with yours is one of the most liberating things you can do in business.

About nine years ago (I've been doing this for 22 years), I made a significant shift in my practice. I ensured that the people I work with – partners, clients, team members – have compatible values with mine.

Notice I said compatible, not identical. They don't have to be the same values, but they must be compatible so that:

1. You never feel like you have to apologize for what's important to you
2. They never feel like they have to apologize for what's important to them

This creates a reciprocity where everyone feels safe and comfortable. You're not constantly fighting against fundamental differences in what you each care about.

Think about it like having a close friend who hates the outdoors when camping is your passion. You're always going to be at odds about how to spend time together. Business relationships are similar but with higher stakes.

## Personal Growth Precedes Business Growth

I've worked with countless clients over the years, and I've noticed something remarkable: the business is nothing without the solidity of the CEO behind it, the visionary, the person, and all their values.

When I think about Mark, and everyone's evolution I've ever worked with, the biggest transformation always happened with the person first, then their business. The business had a correlating transformation, but 100% of the time, the PERSON had the bigger transformation.

All the systems, teams, and processes are critical – but they're actually the simplest part. They're easy to implement once the foundation is right. The first thing is editing and modifying the person running the business so they're primed to understand the power and need for creating the right infrastructure.

This is why principles and priorities come first in my system: because YOU come first in your business. Fix your foundation, and everything you build will be stronger.

## The Freedom System That Business Books Don't Teach

Most business books and courses assume values that I don't have and never will have. For example, many imply that to be successful, you must be always-on, always growing, always scaling.

But what if your highest value is flexibility and freedom? What if you want to be able to say, "I'm not going to the office for a month" and actually do that?

Almost any traditional business consultant would say, "That's insane! You can't run a business like that."

I wouldn't say that. I'd say, "You won't run the optimal business that way from a pure growth perspective. There will be things that suffer."

But there are always trade-offs. If you have enough leaders in place, if the business is profitable, if your people are happy, and your highest value is freedom to do what you want with your time – then you've created the perfect thing FOR YOU.

Business books and courses don't typically approach things from this perspective. They judge you with "you could do better, you could hire someone, you could do this."

Yes, but everything comes with more stress. Every person you hire means more responsibility and more expectations. And we've already talked about how failure to meet expectations is where most stress and anxiety come from.

If your higher value is flexibility and fluidity in life so you can be a free agent, then the trade-offs will be losing some structure and momentum – but you'll maintain that autonomy and freedom throughout your life.

You're leveraging everything as much as you can, not for the sake of revenue. Revenue is feeding the autonomy. Revenue is the secondary thing. The autonomy and freedom come first.

## Start with Your Personal Values Inventory

So how do we begin this process of clarifying principles and priorities? We start with a personal values inventory.

I want you to spend time thinking deeply about what truly matters to you in these categories:

1. **Time** – How do you want to spend your days? What time boundaries are non-negotiable?
2. **Relationships** – What qualities do you want in your business relationships?
3. **Money** – Beyond a specific number, what's your relationship with money?
4. **Work Environment** – Where and how do you work best?
5. **Purpose** – What impact do you want to have?
6. **Personal Growth** – How does your business contribute to who you're becoming?

For each category, write down three things you value most. Then narrow those 18 values down to your top 5 overall.

These become your decision-making filters. When you're faced with choices about:
- Which clients to take
- What projects to pursue
- How to structure your day
- Whether to hire someone
- What prices to charge

...you'll run those decisions through your values filters. If something aligns with 4-5 of your core values, it's almost certainly a "yes." If it only hits 1-2, it's probably a "no" unless there's a compelling reason otherwise.

## Trading Up, Not Trading Off

A clarifying moment for many of my clients is when they realize they've been thinking about priorities all wrong. They've been trying to "balance" things, which implies a zero-sum game where giving to one area means taking from another.

What I teach instead is "trading up" – making conscious choices that maximize what matters most to you.

I despise waste. I have finite energy and only 24 hours a day, and only a handful of those are truly mine to spend on what matters to me. I want an amazing life, and I figured out how to create that for myself.

Along the way, I figured out how to help people with totally different values and mental processes do the same.

The exercise we're about to go through looks deceptively simple. It's just a spreadsheet – but pretend that spreadsheet is like Clark Kent. It only looks like a nerdy news reporter, but in real life, it's a superhero.

I first had people do this exercise 12 years ago under another program called My Freedom Systems. I've been delighted to learn that this exercise ALONE was deemed worth the price of my full course. And not only that, but 12 years later, these principles are still just as useful in helping people make the most money with the least amount of time and stress.

## The Priorities Matrix: Your Business Superhero

Now we're going to create what I call the Priorities Matrix. This is where we translate your personal values into practical business priorities.

For each of your top 5 personal values, ask:
1. What business activities directly support this value?
2. What business activities directly conflict with this value?
3. What metrics would tell me I'm honoring this value?

For example, if "family time" is a core value:
- Supporting activities might include: automation, delegation, strict work hours
- Conflicting activities might include: clients who need constant availability, projects with unpredictable timelines
- Metrics might include: number of dinner times uninterrupted by work, weekends fully present with family

This matrix becomes your strategic plan, your filter for opportunities, and your accountability tool.

## Making It Real: The Values-to-Actions Pipeline

The final piece of this framework is creating your Values-to-Actions Pipeline. This is where rubber meets road.

For each priority in your matrix:
1. What's ONE next action you can take in the next 7 days?
2. What system can you create to support this priority?
3. How will you measure whether you're living this priority?

Most people keep their values vague and aspirational, which makes them useless in daily decisions. When you create this pipeline, you're ensuring your big-picture values translate into concrete actions.

I had a client – a voice coach and musician who hated numbers and all administrative things (I have yet to meet a business owner who actually likes that stuff). She trusted me and did this exercise.

When she finally completed it, she immediately saw how she could reach her goals exponentially faster. She wanted to buy a ranch to foster children and teach music, and she got there THREE YEARS earlier than she had planned. I just got the sweetest message from her on my birthday – a video of her on the ranch inviting me to visit.

That's the power of aligning your business with what truly matters to you.

## The Seasons of Values

Before we wrap up this chapter, I want to emphasize something important: there are different seasons in business and life.

I don't believe in absolutes like "I would never do X" or "Always do Y." There are very few things that are eternally and infinitely true.

The seasons in your life and business are critically important. As coaches or consultants or leaders or teachers, we help people understand that there is a season where something does not make sense for you – don't do it. But only you can know that.

If you follow advice that's not compatible with your current season, your environment, your skills, or your values, you're creating a recipe for disaster – on a spiritual level, on an emotional level, on a relationship level. Anything that's so counter to those particular elements will be destructive inside, and you'll eventually implode.

Your principles and priorities will guide you through these seasons, helping you recognize when to shift gears, when to push forward, and when to pull back.

## Bringing It All Together

When principles inform priorities, and priorities inform actions, you create a business that serves your life rather than consumes it.

Remember:
- Nobody initially cares about transforming their priorities – they care about results
- Put the big rocks (your true priorities) in first
- Discover what truly matters, not just what you don't want
- Use your values as your decision-making framework
- Understand that values shift until they lock
- Surround yourself with people who have compatible values
- Personal growth precedes business growth
- Create a business freedom system based on YOUR values
- Build your Priorities Matrix
- Create a Values-to-Actions Pipeline
- Recognize the seasons of business and life

The next time you sit down to work and think "What should I do today?" you'll have absolute clarity. You'll know exactly what matters most and why. You'll make decisions faster, with more confidence, and with far less stress.

And that, my friend, is the true power of principles and priorities.

In the next chapter, we'll build on this foundation and explore Simple Finance Systems – because once you know what matters, you need to ensure that What Comes In > What Goes Out to support your priorities.

But first, complete the exercises in this chapter. They're not just busywork – they're the cornerstone of everything else we'll build together.
