# The Mindset Shift: You Actually Are Expert Enough

Let's be real for a minute. You're sitting there right now thinking, "Yeah, that all sounds nice, Tina, but I can't charge THAT much for what I do."

I see you. I've been in those shoes, staring at my price list, finger hovering over the keyboard, thinking about adding that extra zero but feeling like an absolute fraud.

Remember when you first rode a bike without training wheels? That gut-dropping moment when your parent let go and you were suddenly on your own? That's exactly how it feels to raise your prices. Terrifying. Exhilarating. And absolutely necessary for growth.

Look, most unpaid experts don't yet consider themselves expert enough to charge money. It's that gnawing voice in your head saying, "Who am I to charge for this? What if they find out I don't know EVERYTHING?"

Here's the cold, hard truth that nobody told you: Nobody knows everything. Not even the guru charging $25,000 for a VIP day.

Think about it this way: If your neighbor wants you to help with his computer because he's a "technoob" and you're awesome, he might offer to send over some killer BBQ when he grills this weekend instead of paying you.

Easy deal, right? That food is going to cost him money and time, and you're okay with that.

Why? Because you gave him value and you both know it.

But when it comes to charging actual money from strangers? Suddenly you're hemming and hawing and thinking maybe you should just do it for the "exposure" or the "testimonials" or whatever other BS excuse you've been telling yourself.

Sound familiar? I thought so.

When I first started as a consultant, I charged $25 an hour. TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS. I had six years of corporate experience building systems that saved entire departments. I was good. I was fast. And I was charging less than a mediocre plumber.

Why? Because I didn't believe I was expert enough.

Fast forward to now – clients happily pay me thousands for the same brain, just with more experience.

The difference? Not my skills. My belief in the value I provide.

You're in the exact same spot right now. You know more than the average person, and you can help them do something faster or better than they could do it themselves. That's expertise, plain and simple.

But you're still charging peanuts because deep down, you're afraid. Afraid they'll say no. Afraid they'll laugh. Afraid they'll discover you're not perfect.

Let me save you years of undercharging: They won't say no if you show value. They won't laugh if you deliver results. And they already know you're not perfect – they just don't care as long as you solve their problem.

Money is simply the currency used to exchange value. Nothing more, nothing less.

So here's what you're going to do right now. Open your pricing sheet. Add that 10%. Feel the fear. Do it anyway. The only one saying no to your worth right now is you.

If you're thinking, "But my market can't afford higher prices!" – I'm calling BS. Your "market" isn't every broke person with a pulse. Your market is the people who value solutions enough to pay for them. And those people are out there, right now, waiting for you to show up and solve their problems.

They're literally waiting for you while you're over here doubting yourself.

Don't make them wait any longer.
