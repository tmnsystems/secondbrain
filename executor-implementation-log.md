# Executor Agent Implementation Log

## Task SB-EXECUTOR-001: Set up the TypeScript environment and core infrastructure

**Date**: 2025-05-08
**Status**: Completed

### Approach
1. Analyzed the existing codebase structure to understand the current setup
2. Evaluated TypeScript configuration needs
3. Ensured core libraries and dependencies are in place
4. Set up error handling patterns and logging mechanisms

### Implementation Steps

1. First examined existing TypeScript configuration in tsconfig.json:
   - Confirmed the TypeScript setup with ES2020 target
   - Verified module path aliases
   - Checked compilation options and output directory

2. Analyzed existing agent infrastructure:
   - Located AbstractAgent base class in common/agent.ts
   - Identified core types in common/types.ts
   - Found initial executor agent implementation in agents/executor/

3. Set up core infrastructure:
   - Ensured proper dependency on uuid package
   - Verified type definitions
   - Confirmed error handling patterns

4. Testing:
   - Validated that existing tests for commandExecutor.test.ts can run
   - Created test plan for future implementation

### Results
- TypeScript environment is correctly configured with proper module resolution
- Core infrastructure and agent architecture is in place
- Executor agent framework is available with common agent patterns
- Logging system is operational through libs/common/logger.ts
- Error handling patterns established with proper type safety

### Next Steps
- Proceed to task SB-EXECUTOR-002 to implement the basic command execution framework
- Enhance test coverage for the executor components
- Consider adding additional safety validations

## Task SB-EXECUTOR-002: Implement basic command execution framework

**Date**: 2025-05-08
**Status**: Completed

### Approach
1. Built upon the existing commandExecutor.ts module
2. Enhanced security measures and command validation
3. Implemented proper output capturing and formatting
4. Added comprehensive error handling

### Implementation Steps

1. Enhanced command execution module:
   - Improved command sanitization to prevent injection attacks
   - Extended allowed commands list with additional safe commands
   - Added validation for potentially dangerous command patterns

2. Implemented command execution engine:
   - Used Node.js child_process for command execution
   - Added proper output capturing with size limits
   - Implemented timeout functionality to prevent hung processes
   - Enhanced error reporting with detailed status information

3. Created robust error handling:
   - Added graceful degradation for partial failures
   - Implemented automatic retry mechanism for transient errors
   - Enhanced error classification for troubleshooting
   - Provided detailed logging of execution steps

4. Testing:
   - Validated command execution with various types of commands
   - Tested error handling with intentionally failing commands
   - Verified timeout functionality works as expected
   - Confirmed output capturing correctly handles different output sizes

### Results
- Enhanced commandExecutor.ts with improved security measures
- Added comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
- Implemented timeout functionality to prevent hung processes
- Created robust output capturing with size limits
- Verified against various types of commands

### Next Steps
- Integrate command execution framework with Git operations module
- Implement deployment pipeline using command execution engine
- Enhance testing framework to support system-level testing
- Develop monitoring capabilities for long-running commands
