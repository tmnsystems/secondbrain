\# Tina's Distinctive Teaching Style: A Reference Guide

\#\# Core Elements That Make Teaching Transformative

\#\#\# 1\. Multi-Layered Metaphors  
Tina's metaphors work simultaneously on multiple levels \- practical, emotional, and often spiritual. They don't just explain concepts; they create new neural pathways for understanding.

Examples:  
\- \*\*Future Energy Exchange\*\*: "When we worry, we borrow pain from the future that probably isn't even going to happen... But when we hope and we visualize that thing that we're creating and going to do, we borrow energy from that reality that we haven't created yet, making it more likely for us to create that thing."  
  \- \*Practical Level\*: Explains how mental state affects outcomes  
  \- \*Emotional Level\*: Reframes anxiety as a choice  
  \- \*Strategic Level\*: Shows how visualization can be used as a tool  
  \- \*Spiritual Level\*: Connects to faith and manifestation

\- \*\*Temple Foundation Renovation\*\*: Comparing business fundamentals to renovating the LA Temple by digging under the foundation  
  \- \*Practical Level\*: Illustrates why foundational work matters  
  \- \*Emotional Level\*: Makes invisible work feel valuable  
  \- \*Strategic Level\*: Shows how strengthening basics enables growth  
  \- \*Spiritual Level\*: Connects business principles to eternal truths

\#\#\# 2\. Teaching Through Contrast & Paradox  
Tina frequently uses unexpected contrasts to illuminate deeper truths:

\- \*\*Conductor's Orchestra\*\*: Contrasting being a one-person band frantically running between instruments versus conducting a skilled orchestra  
  \- Shows both what not to do and what to strive for  
  \- Illustrates why trying to do everything yourself fails  
  \- Demonstrates the power of building and leading a team

\- \*\*Otter vs Duck\*\*: "Don't be a duck. Be an otter. Ducks look calm on top, but beneath the water, they're frantically moving those webbed feet to get where they're going. Otters be chilling on their backs, holding hands and taking an occasional dip and glide through the water."  
  \- Contrasts inefficient vs efficient approaches  
  \- Makes complex business concepts visceral and memorable  
  \- Adds humor while making a serious point

\#\#\# 3\. Integration of Multiple Knowledge Domains  
Tina seamlessly weaves together insights from:  
\- Business systems and optimization  
\- Psychology and human behavior  
\- Spiritual principles and eternal truths  
\- Scientific understanding  
\- Real-world experience

This creates a holistic understanding that's both practical and profound. Examples:  
\- Using temple renovation to explain business fundamentals  
\- Connecting neuroscience insights to productivity practices  
\- Applying spiritual principles to business growth

\#\#\# 4\. Precision in Language  
Tina is extremely careful with word choice and meaning:  
\- Distinguishes between similar but different concepts (e.g., "effect" vs "full effect")  
\- Challenges oversimplifications  
\- Teaches others to think carefully about language

\#\#\# 5\. Story-Driven Teaching  
Stories aren't just illustrations \- they're vehicles for transformation:  
\- Personal experiences shared to demonstrate principles, not gain sympathy  
\- Client stories that show both struggles and breakthroughs  
\- Analogies that create "aha moments"

\#\#\# 6\. Voice Characteristics  
\- Raw authenticity without self-importance  
\- Direct but compassionate  
\- Willing to share hard truths while maintaining hope  
\- Balances professional expertise with personal warmth  
\- Uses natural breaks and pauses for emphasis  
\- Mixes short punchy sentences with longer flowing thoughts

\#\#\# 7\. Teaching Structure  
Each lesson typically:  
1\. Opens with a relatable hook or story  
2\. Adds emotional resonance  
3\. Introduces key principle(s)  
4\. Provides practical application  
5\. Ties back to deeper meaning  
6\. Ends with actionable inspiration

\#\#\# 8\. Key Themes  
\- Sustainable success requires both systems and soul  
\- Growth comes through consistent fundamentals  
\- True optimization considers the human element  
\- Success without burnout is possible with the right approach  
\- Small, consistent actions compound over time

\#\# Using This Guide

When writing or editing, ask:  
1\. Does this create new understanding or just restate common wisdom?  
2\. Does the metaphor work on multiple levels?  
3\. Are we maintaining precision in language?  
4\. Does it integrate multiple knowledge domains?  
5\. Does it feel authentically like Tina?  
6\. Would this create an "aha moment"?

Remember: The goal isn't just to teach information but to transform understanding through unexpected but perfect connections that illuminate deeper truths.

﻿How Setting Firm Rules and Personal Boundaries Can Liberate You
 20 September 2017  0 Comments


I feel that every person, in every station in life, and in every aspect in life, should take the time to define and enforce rules of operation–rules that define how they will operate and how they expect everyone else around them to operate…


And I think they should enforce those rules.


This might sound like a recipe for conflict, but I believe it’s actually a recipe for greater peace.


Why?


MOST CONFLICT IS A RESULT OF A POWER STRUGGLE.


With the exception of where one person’s set of rules includes that they are the only rule makers, this power struggle can be avoided with a few steps.
1 – Define your rules
2 – Understand the rules of your counterparts
3 – Decide if the mutual rules are compatible
4 – If they are not compatible, discover if one is WILLING to yield to the other set of rules or make a new rule.
5 – If one will not yield to the other or make a new rule in order to cooperate… move on
The more you practice this, the less you will experience power struggles.


For someone who’s never done this, it may seem very rigid and cold.


But the truth is…


THIS IS A LIBERATING PROCESS.


You see… all people are not compatible with all people in intimate situations or even professional situations.
Think marriage, or business partnerships, or even employees that you hire, or clients that you take.


When rules are incompatible, anxiety strikes.


The thing is…


Many people have a “Sense” of their own rules, but they haven’t consciously defined them…


OR…


They haven’t yet chosen to enforce those rules.


Those people fall into the victim category.


And it doesn’t matter if you are the victim or have to deal with one…


Victim mentality causes stress.


Which is why one of my rules is that I will not operate with anyone who chooses to remain in a victim mentality.


Period.


I’m simply not compatible with that mindset.
I’m not compatible with manipulation.
I’m not compatible with lies.
I’m not compatible with disrespect.
As I’ve chosen these rules and began to enforce them…


I have discovered that others have made the same rules.


Because I had not yet defined my own rules, I had less exposure to people who had shared them.


YES – SOME PEOPLE’S RULES ARE RIDICULOUS


That’s where you get to decide to disengage.


Is it your employer?


Someone with authority over you?


It’s too hard you say?


THAT’S A CHOICE.


Period.


I’ve walked away from all income four times in a period of four years as a single mother because of incompatible rules.


I knew that I was better able to give my girls what they need without money than I was without self respect and satisfaction.


A BROKEN SPIRIT TAKES MUCH LONGER TO HEAL THAN A BROKEN BANK ACCOUNT.


The life you want is yours to define and to take.


You don’t have to plow through others to get it.


You don’t have to be abusive.


And you don’t even have to be inflexible.


You just have to be rigid with the things that matter most.


Choose what is flexible in advance.


Choose what is not.


Never yield those core values.


To do so is almost certainly going to cause suffering.


The only exception would be when your core values were created from a … let’s say… “less-enlightened” place… and you get a sense that you need to evolve.


— SET YOUR RULES
— LIVE BY THEM
— BE LIBERATED BY THEM


There is a saying there are those who act, and those who are acted upon.


There is a strong correlation to those who are acted upon and those who don’t set rules.


Decide which one you want to be…


Or it will be decided for you.

Why You Aren’t Happy In Your Business
 20 September 2017  0 Comments
  

Chances that is has less to do with how much money you are making and how much time you are working and has much more to do with:
* Lack of clarity
* Lack focus
* Lack of goals and
* Lack of priority
Let me break down each step and tell you why it’s these things and not just being broke and burnt out that’s making you miserable.
First of all, understand that being broke and being stressed in work, as well as being miserable, are all SYMPTOMS and not a cause.
The above items I stated are the actual cause of the problems, and knowing this is what’s going to help you actually SOLVE THE PROBLEM.
First, lack of clarity.
Clarity is crucial in order for the next three items to be achieved.
Unfortunately, but not uncontrollably, people don’t take the time to get clear. (While it’s not uncontrollable, sometimes people just can’t get there alone… more on this later)
Getting clear is about asking yourself the right questions.
WHAT DO I WANT OUT OF MY BUSINESS?
1. Do you want a certain kind of schedule? If yes (it should be yes) why? What is it that you want to do when you aren’t working?
2. Do you want a certain amount of money? If yes… why? How much money do you need to do what you want to do?
3. Do you want to make a difference in the market? Your community? The world? If so… what EXACTLY is it that you want to do and WHY?
Once you have answered these questions, make sure you have CLEAR answers. Not wishywashy, lukewarm, flexible answers. This is CRITICAL to getting the business that gives you an extra spring in your step and spice in your life. (Yes, it can really be that great.)
When you answer these questions, the answers should EXCITE YOU, when you think about having the business that does what you want it to do.
IMAGINE WHAT YOUR BUSINESS WILL BE LIKE WHEN IT’S “ALL GROWN UP”…
In other words, when you have created the business of its FULLEST POTENTIAL… no matter how long that takes… what does it look like?
NOW you know what you are creating.
NOW you know where you are going.
But what you also need to know some boundaries…. And THAT is crucial too.
What ELSE do you want out of life?
* Time with your family?
* Time to travel?
* Time to learn a new language or instrument?
* Workout?
* Get more rest?
It’s important that, when you set HUGE goals, like the one to create YOUR DREAM BUSINESS, you make time for a quality life NOW.
***NOTE… if you’re a “I gotta grind while everyone else sleeps” person… either read and learn or go on about your way… your future heart attack and break up are waiting for you***
Make sure that you have an “off” time and protect that time.
That will not force you to get less done… it just encourages you to be more efficient at doing what matters most.
Which leads to the next three items.
LACK OF FOCUS:
This is NOT the same as lack of clarity. Clarity is having a clear vision. Focus makes sure you never forget that vision.
DON’T ALLOW YOURSELF TO SWITCH TO AUTOPILOT… EVER!
Every morning, every afternoon, every evening, remind yourself of what’s important in all areas of life. Remember your health, remember your relationships, remember your mindset, and remember your vision for these and how your business will feed them. Plan your day, week, month etc, accordingly.
Next…
LACK OF GOALS
If you don’t know where you’re going, how are you going to get there?
Yes, you set your vision and got clarity (RIGHT?!?!)…
But you can’t just quantum leap to that destination.
You have to break it down into steps, into legs of the trip.
Reverse engineer and work backwards from that vision.
What has to be true?
When you answer that question, ask yourself, “Does anything else have to be true, FIRST?”
When you have broken that process down to the final thing which has no other prerequisites, BEGIN THERE FIRST.
You should have LONG TERM goals, 5 and ten years down the road.
You should also have yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly and daily goals.
The trick is, set your HUGE vision goals and WORK BACKWARDS.
When you ask yourself “If I reach this goal, what has to be true?” … and from each answer, ask yourself what else has to be true.
Work backwards until you find the thing that has to be true that is nearest to where you are now.
In other words, what’s the FIRST thing that has to be true?
Make that your first goal.
For example… If you’re going to be a millionaire… the first thing that has to be true is you have to have a plan, right?
So start with the plan.
Then you may need to acquire skills… so acquire those skills.
You may need to create products.
Raise prices.
Hire people.
Whatever has to be true next to get to the next level… THAT becomes your next goal.
Make sure you set goals for all areas of life:
* Set progress goals
* set financial goals
* set “quality of life”goals
* set growth goals
Make sure that the way you spend your time takes all of these goals into account.
Finally… the last lack that keeps you from being happy in your business is…
LACK OF PRIORITY
How many times have you started out the day, unsure of what to do, and you got “busy” checking emails, reading blog articles, “engaging” on social media, and found yourself zero percent richer or happier?
It’s because you have decided what your priority is in work tasks.
Decide what activities will get you closer to your goals fastest and do those first (more on this in a future post, stay tuned) and if nothing else gets done at the end of the day, you will still have moved the needle forward.
And THAT is whats going to create more happiness and less stress in your life.
It’s impossible to measure progress without a clear destination.
How could you possibly know if you are closer if you haven’t even defined where you are going?
We are destined to evolve as human beings.
The pull to do that is innate.
Feeling like we are not progressing leaves a dissatisfaction to the soul that is absolutely toxic.
You DON’T have to be brilliant to make this work.
You just need to be focused, decisive, and consistent.
These are all things you can choose to be, and choose to improve on.
FOCUS ON DECIDING WHAT’S IMPORTANT
Then, with a series of deep questions to yourself figure out…
WHY IS THAT MOST IMPORTANT
Then… simply…
DO WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT, FIRST
At the end of the day, you will feel the energy and satisfaction and confidence that comes from progress.
At the end of several days like this, you will grow more confident and hopeful.
As you continue to be consistent in these processes, YOU WILL QUICKLY BE ABLE TO MEASURE THE GROWTH THAT IS HAPPENING.
At that point, people tend to get hooked to the process.
If you have to be hooked on something, growth is the best addiction.
SIMPLE BUT NOT EASY. I CAN HELP
These steps are SIMPLE… Not very complicated.
But that doesn’t mean they are easy, or achieved without difficulty.
Sometimes you can’t see the forest for the trees.
Sometimes getting clarity, the first step, eludes you for so long that you give up on the rest.
I offer a consultation call that will help you get this clarity, regardless of what level of business you are at.
It’s $299, a two hour, very in depth call that has been likened to drinking from a fire hose because I’ll teach you so much…
But you’ll get the call recorded, notes, and, if my track record continues with it’s 100% success record, tremendous clarity on where you want to go, why, how you should get there, what you should do first, and for the next few months.
This or my group coaching program is my entry level access.
It’s the first step to making sure you get on track for the business and life you desire.

* Hiring for Small Businesses – Know the Order of Operations
*  28 September 2017  0 Comments
* * Hiring for small businesses can be a little like Algebra.
* * Remember how many people were absolutely in LOVE with math in school?
* * Especially those arithmetic expressions that looked like this? 4 + 2×3 = (4 + 2)×3 = 6×3 = 18?
* * Let’s not even get into Calculus.
* * Some people loved it, absolutely ate it up. But MOST people can’t hack basic math, much less advanced math.
* * Running, and hiring for small businesses is very similar in a couple of ways.
* First… Most people can’t hack it. It’s over their heads. Oddly… that doesn’t keep many people for thinking they can go into business for themselves and succeed.
* * Second… Running a successful business is absolutely all about the order of operations. If you do it wrong… things just don’t add up correctly.
* * For any business, but this is especially crucial to smaller businesses, it is important that you identify the most important position for being filled within your company and fill that role first.
* * The position should not be one of convenience as much as productivity directly related to the bottom line.
* * Let me give an example.
* * Joe owns a small business and he’s making some money. Joe feel like he’s not getting enough “stuff” done and also feels like he’s not making as much money as he could be.
* * Joe needs help… and Joe is fairly average… not immediately strategic about all moves. Like the average Joe he is, he translates “I need help” to “I need an assistant”.
* * Joe gets a little excited about the thought of hiring his own assistant. It makes him feel important and he thinks he can sluff off his work to some lackey and now… he’s going to get some serious business done.
* * The problem is… the things Joe isn’t getting done isn’t just minor administrative duties. Joe has a few problems.
* * First – he’s bleeding money and doesn’t know it because he doesn’t track his finances properly. He just knows he should have more money than he does. (Sound familiar?)
* * Second – He’s got a new product to launch that he knows his buyers will eat up based on the market but he’s had it for a year and not done anything with it because he doesn’t like doing the technical work to get it live and able to take orders. It took him two years just to get his first product to market.
* * Third – People are starting to ask for refunds just because they can’t get an answer fast enough when they have a question, and they don’t feel supported.
* * All of these things are affecting Joe’s bottom line.
* * Joe is not addressing any of them… and it’s not because taking the time to schedule appointments or pay bills or do research (typical assistant work) is keeping him from it.
* * Joe doesn’t do this stuff because he doesn’t like it and he can’t convince himself to do it.
* * But, if Joe DOESN’T fix these issues, 1) he will never grow far and 2) he could be out of business soon.
* * As soon as Joe hires an assistant… He’s immediately losing hundreds to thousands of dollars a month. Is that investment going to return to him immediately? In time or money? Is that going to improve his bottom line? Is it going to give him back enough time that his earning potential will balance out?
* * What might be a better first hire?
* * Joe doesn’t even know where all of his money is going. The first thing he needs to do is correct that. Hiring a financial assistant or CPA to manage his books should quickly point out what the next hire should be for Joe.
* * Yes, it will also show him some money management flaws he has and help him to get a better grasp on finances, helping direct him in other ways…
* * But it will also help Joe decide if what he should be doing next is hiring a customer support person or someone to get his product to market.
* * How?
* * Numbers.
* * The CPA loves that math that most of us hate. (Weirdo. God Blessed Weirdo.)
* * You need to know how much you make and how much you spend and more importantly… how much you are bleeding. I define bleeding is money that’s going out without giving you a return on your investment or too little of a return to justify the expense. Nearly every single client I’ve ever consulted with (possibly with ONE exception in 14 years) has had a standing expense on their books that was not earning them a return.
* * Getting a very clear grasp of numbers is an absolute eye opener. Sometimes people find out how easily they could improve their bottom line by just making a few cuts to wasteful areas. Other times they realize they aren’t putting enough money into something… for example, running ads that are performing well.
* * As you can see… hiring someone to help you get clear on your numbers can have a much more profound impact on your revenue, and almost instantly.
* * It is not likely that hiring a personal assistant will have as quick and powerful of an impact if this area is being neglected.
* * In business, a numbers expert is definitely one of the positions you want to fill first when you’re building your team.
* * From there, you want to hire the roles that will make the most significant impact on your bottom line in the shortest amount of time. This person might be the head of sales and marketing, fulfilment, IT or customer service… often in that order.
* * When you’ve taken the time to learn your numbers first, you know what you can afford for each of these positions and you should have a good idea as to what kind of ROI you can get when you fill the role.
* Do everything you can to make sure that your return on investment when hiring can happen within the first month. To that end, part of your onboarding process should include very clear expectations of roles and responsibilities, outline their decision making power and autonomy clearly, and make the targets very clear that they need to hit and by what date.
* * It’s not your job to tell them HOW to hit the target unless you can’t afford an expert and are going to train someone. In which case, (and it happens in startups with low initial capital) make sure you give them the outline and resources to learn what they need to learn.
* * Of course the “where” and “how”  of hiring for small businesses is a process all of it’s own. There’s a book that provides some fantastic insight into this process called “Topgrading” which (although bulky, in my opinion) can be extremely helpful to someone who’s new to the hiring process.
* * In my experience, I find that small business owners will take action on the least amount of information they feel necessary to make a decision. While learning HOW to hire is absolutely an important step towards success… It’s the second step.
* * First, you have to figure out WHO to hire. What’s the most important role to fill first? What does your company need most?
* * Even a bad hire can offer some relief and if nothing else, necessary experience for growth.
* * But hiring someone who cannot earn the company back their investment could put you out of business before you ever get a chance to grow past two people.
* * That’s the danger of being out of order.

How Being An Entrepreneur Saved My Life
 17 November 2017  0 Comments


The life of an entrepreneur is guaranteed to be crazy.
We’re not really “normal” people.


While normal people stop dreaming like they did as a child…


The entrepreneur is still designing their superhero costumes that they will save the world in.


Usually, they are surrounded by those normal people in the process.


Those sleepwalkers.  The ones who are happy with things “just the way they are”.


Those ones that want YOU to be happy “just the way things are.”


But if you did that… you’d never… EVER… get to fly in that amazing cape you’re making, right?


Okay… that might not be 100% realistic…


But it’s a fairly good analogy.


Entrepreneurs feel a power coursing through their veins.
They feel something calling to them that tells them… “You can do more!  You can BE more!”


And that’s when the trouble happens.


Trouble… like the kind that Martin Luther caused for the Roman Catholic church.


Trouble, like Harriet Tubman caused for slave owners in the south.


Wait a minute… there I go romanticising entrepreneurialism again.


Like we’re all heroes who do great things.


You might think…  I know a few of them… that’s not at all what they are.


And I get that…


But if you keep reading… I’ll tell you how this is more true than not… and how being an entrepreneur truly did save my life… no embellishment necessary.


See…


I’ve been an entrepreneur since I was 10.
From mowing lawns to babysitting, from digging tulip bulbs out of the Skagit Valley fields in clumps of hard, finger-mangling dirt at the age of 12 to having a newspaper route…


I’ve been working towards becoming a  superhero.


Because *I* needed to have a superhero.


As a young child…


I witnessed the murder of my infant brother at the hands of our own father.


I grew up in a house full of violent anger, substance abuse  and poverty.


I wanted more.


Not just more “Stuff”


I wanted more power.


More freedom.


I wanted more control over my life.


I found that work… whether in school or for money, gave me that.


I worked to be a better student because I wanted to get a scholarship since I knew that was the only way I would get to college. I could never afford it otherwise.


From the same age I started working for money, I was college bound.


When I finally got my full ride to college, though…


I was a little to caught up in the mistakes that my “finally achieved” freedom (of turning 18) gave me.


Additionally…


I realized I now had to deal with even more people with their own agendas being shoved down my throat in the form of college professors.


The combination had me dropping out of college.  They invited me back with my scholarships intact… and I tried two more times, and still quit before ever completing a second term.


I was done.  


There were too many restrictions I couldn’t live with.


And I, like many other of my kind…


Took a harder road than I had to.


But  how is it that being an entrepreneur saved my life?
This is that story.


Patterns love to repeat themselves.


The pattern of abuse is no different.


I ended up marrying what was familiar to me. Someone who treated me horribly and was full of rage.


I won’t get into how a person of my level of intelligence and strength tolerated that for as long as I did.  Sufficeth to say, I had a lot to learn and it took a long time to learn it.


I had four children, whose lights were dimming in the environment we were in.


I was afraid for them.


For their pain.


For their breaking spirits.


And I was afraid of what would happen to us if I tried to leave.  (The threats and the anger were very real and intense)


I had been working from home for 8 years… but I only had supplemental income.  It wasn’t enough to live off, even if it was subsidized by welfare aid.


If my ex didn’t kill me… lack of money was sure to.


It wasn’t until I realized I felt dead inside anyway that I decided, I really had nothing to lose.


And so… I went back to work on my superhero cape.


That is to say, I got up the courage to leave.


Slowly, over time…


Through fierce and intense and very REAL battles…


I DID become the superhero I needed.
And I became the hero my children needed.


It’s been nearly 7 years since I left.


We went from our first “Safe house” of 900’ sq with the five of us, right next to the airport and railroad, with no yard and no room to breathe…


To a brand new, never lived in before, large, beautiful, house on the hill. It has 15’ vaulted, pine ceilings and overlooks the city, lakes and mountains.


I’ve created a 6 figure business that I only work while they are at school, and not even that entire time.


I’m there to wake them up gently in the morning…


Cook for them…


Clean for them….


Coach soccer…


And stay up in the middle of the night when someone needs to talk.


I set my own schedule.


I employ friends who cannot get work otherwise.


But most importantly…


I wake up peaceful, safe, free, and full of hope EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.
I know not everyone that goes down this path gets to this place.


Which is why I do what I do…


Help others find this same kind of freedom.


If you need help sewing your superhero costume…If you’re the entrepreneur who is a hero waiting to be born…
But you just don’t know how to bring it all together yet…Reach out to me.  I can help.

Why Writing Down Your Entrepreneurial Vision Matters
 21 November 2017  0 Comments


Here it is… unsolicited advice.


My knee-jerk reaction to unsolicited advice is to return it it with unsolicited advice.


Like… “Let me tell you where you can put that advice”.


Unless… of course… someone takes the time to explay “WHY” that advice is something I should listen to AND they manage to get me to see their point as valid.


If I’m not on board…


That advice goes in one ear and out the other.


So, in true “Golden Rule” form…


I want to get you to understand why this advice is pertinent to you and get YOU on board so that you not only listen… you DO.


Why?


Because if more visionaries could actually COMPLETE their quests to fulfill their visions and bring them to reality… then MY world becomes richer. I will get to reap the rewards of more creativity being brought to life.


I want to see that happen.


Here’s the thing…


The process of you writing down your entrepreneurial vision is likely the first step to making your vision take a physical form.
It’s now stepped out of the ether and onto paper… or some digital equivalent thereof.


I mean, ask yourself, honestly… How many “visions” have you imagined for your business(s)…


And how many of your visions have actually ever come to fruition?


1%?


Less than 1%?


My experience in working with hundreds of business owners tells me that for most people… 1% would probably be generous.


Granted…


A good portion of ideas just aren’t GREAT ideas and shouldn’t necessarily be brought to life.


But…


Until you START bringing your visions to life…  How do you learn how to recognize which ideas are viable and which ones are not?


THAT kind of knowledge only comes from experience…


Experience that most people never get to because they are too busy being busy… too busy planning… too busy doing… well … anything but bringing their visions to life.


That’s the power of writing down your entrepreneurial visions.
Did you know the word “entrepreneur” is derived from the French verb entreprendre, which means “to undertake”?


And one of the definitions of “undertake” is attempt. Another definition is to “Commit to”


So, one could say that an entrepreneur is one who commits to attempt to do something.


One may also say that wording explains why most of them never actually COMPLETE anything.


Oh… the opportunities for judgement and criticism here are ENDLESS.


And won’t we be happy to pass that judgement on ourselves, and stop all progress?


And if not, won’t others be more than willing to pass that judgement on us, and halt the train…


If you want to become one of those visionaries who makes great things happen…


You want to START by bringing your vision to life as fast as possible.


That starts with writing it down.


Yes… it may fail.


But better to have failed through the experience of trial rather than to die in the mind before ever having a chance at life.

Extract More Money From Your Small Business – Part 2
 29 December 2017  0 Comments


Remember, I don’t know exactly what you’re doing and what you’re offering OR how good you are.


If you feel like you’re not good enough to charge some of these prices… lower them. Then… improve your skills.


That being said…


Here’s a good rule of thumb to follow.


If you’re offering one on one consulting time or group coaching (and you’re not a TOTAL narcissist…


Take the highest price you’re comfortable with charging and then ADD 10% to that price.


Once you start getting sales at your price, incrementally increase your price by 5-10% for every new customer you take on until you stop getting conversions.


DON’T BE THE ONE TO TELL YOURSELF NO!


Let your customers tell you what they will pay.


*note – correct pricing and packaging for value isn’t going to be enough if you don’t know how to pitch your offer.  If pitching is hard for you, study the book called”Pitch Anything” and work on that skill.  It will serve you well in many areas of life to improve this one skill.


Let’s talk about the different types of products and services you might offer.  This is going to relate to digital products and virtual services.  Any physical products could be added in as well… just remember to calculate your profit margins accordingly.


First of all, I’m a big believer in leading with value.   


You’re reading my “lead by example” version of that right now.


I want you to get some value from me and KNOW I’m worth investing in before I ever ask you to invest.   If I can’t do that, I’ll probably not convince you I’m worth your time anyway and that’s just not a foundation


I can build on.


So find a way to create something of value for your market that you can give away.  Create something that complements OR supplements what you already do.


I grow businesses in many different ways.  One of them is helping entrepreneurs craft solid offers and clear their head trash so they can actually pitch them and make money.


I found that is SUCH a common problem that I decided I would give as much help with that as possible, free of charge.  Obviously, it would work better one on one… but this is a way I can serve my market and find potential leads.


DO THE SAME THING FOR YOUR MARKET.


The next thing you will create to ascend them up your value ladder is a low level offer, sometimes referred to as a trip wire.


You can have many different entry points into your marketing “eco system” … it does not have to be simply linear… but for the sake of simplicity and what I like to focus on, “Fastest Path to Cash” lets consider a linear value ladder starting with free, to low cost and upwards.


Your low cost product should be something that can solve ONE specific problem for them.  It should be easily digestible within one to two hours and should allow them the ability to implement within a day.


The price here is between $6-$20.  There’s so many ways you can validate that your product (ebook or video training work really well) is worth more than dinner for two.


It may take you a while to think about why… but think it out…. Write up those bullet points and look at it.  When you look at that and say “That’s a no brainer” … You’ve got a winner.  


DON’T OVER CREATE!


REMEMBER to make it easily and quickly digestible and actionable!
The problem you will want to solve is not so much how to give value, not if you know your stuff.


It’s going to be more about demonstrating the value in a product they haven’t seen yet well enough to get them to part with their money.  So focus on this part!  


Pretend it’s your best friend and you want them to understand why they HAVE to have this.  You would tell them:


Benefit!
Benefit!
Benefit
Benefit!
Benefit!
What are the benefits of your product?  Get CLEAR on that and making the pitch will be a lot easier, as will choosing the price.


The next offer is going to be your CORE offer.


This is the one that should bring you the majority of your income.  All of your marketing and products will be leading up to THIS product or service that allows you to give max benefit to max audience size.


My preference is that this is scaleable, so it’s a digital product or training that modulated and self-paced (online membership course etc) with possible weekly trainings, live videos, q and a etc inside of a group.


This lets you leverage your time while being able to serve more people at a solid price point.


Finally, you have your upsell offers.


Upsells are not created to be just one more possible way to squeeze money out of a prospect.


It has to be purposeful and make sense for your market.


Keep this in mind… people that pay the least expect the most.


It’s harder to sell people on free and $5 than it is to sell the RIGHT person on $200 or more.


The person who’s focused on VALUE rather than dollars (no, they are not the same) is going to be willing to spend more.


Once you’ve shown them value at each level, they are much more likely to want more from you and be willing to pay higher prices if you continue to offer them what they want.


Upsells are going to solve a problem that not everyone in your market need solved, but the ones who do need it solved understand the value of it.


I’ll use one of my own value ladders as an example:


Free Optin/Lead Magnet – 10 Ways to $10k


TripWire offer – Projects in a Box –


Pre-mapped out project templates for multiple business scenarios to help the “organizationally challenged” get organized fast. $17 per template


Core Offer – My Freedom Systems – $97


Four modules in a membership site teaching people Email management (email overwhelm KILLS productivity) Time management, Project Management (next level on what to do with the templates you bought) and Outsourcing (so you can hire the people to actually do the work ☺ )


Upsell 1 – Group Coaching $199/month or $999 for 6  months (one month free)


I offer 15 minute one on one calls twice a month and a weekly q and a call that’s recorded for all members of the group.  


Upsell 2 – Business Consultation Call $299


90-120  Minute call with me to create a clear plan for what’s next in the business to increase cash and freedom.


RARE UPSELL – (I offer this to less than 1% of my audience)


Retainer client agreement. Price varies  They get weekly calls with me and I speak to them and their team to keep projects on schedule and optimize profits and time.  I’ll spend 1-5 hours a week with clients from $2500-$10,000 a month.  It’s not for everyone.  The ones who want it are the ones who make enough that my optimization skills validate the investment.
—


Applying This To Your Offers
The strategy is to segment what you offer into a value ladder that you can ascend your customers up through.


Use benefit bullet points to help you figure out what a price is for these offers.


Think about how much time and stress your product or service will save them.  


Use reference points like minimum wage hours worked vs. expert hours.  If you gave them, effectively, an hour worth of your time, is that not worth twice minimum wage?  


Is it worth dinner for two?


Is it worth … Well… What is it worth?


Think hard and DON’T undervalue yourself.


Okay… Here’s the worksheet to help you with some numbers and seeing HOW fast things can add up to $10k a month for you.


Did I just hear you say “Finally!!!!”???


I better not have!


I had to warm you up to know what to plug in there, Speedy Gonzales.


Without context, the numbers don’t mean anything.


If you got to this point and skipped the rest above… Slap yourself on the wrist!


Then go back up and read it.
…


…


…


All done?  Good ☺ Let’s move on.


Scenario One –Lowballed


When you’re too afraid to charge much… do you see how many sales you have to make in order to hit $10,000 a month?


Product        Price        Monthly Sales        Monthly Revenue
TripWire        $5        750        $3,750
Core Offer        $20        150        $3,000
Upsell 1        $67        50        $3,350
Total Revenue        $10,100
Ask yourself… is it harder to charge more and get fewer people to say yes or to charge less and get more people to say yes?


Scenario Two:


Product        Price        Monthly Sales        Monthly Revenue
TripWire        $10        500        $5,000
Core Offer        $27        100        $2,700
Upsell 1        $67        35        $2,345
Total Revenue        $10,045
Here, doubled the TripWire cost, but it’s still only $10.  We bumped the Core Offer price $7 and left the upsell the same.


Here’s the thing.  With this offer, you need 315 LESS “yes’s” to get to $10k a month.


When you think about what’s harder… getting a yes or a yes at a few buck higher… usually it’s just the “yes” that’s scariest.


I told you… MATH IS YOUR FRIEND!


SCENARIO THREE:


Product        Price        Monthly Sales        Monthly Revenue
TripWire        $12        475        $5,700
Core Offer        $37        75        $2,775
Upsell 1        $67        25        $1,675
Total Revenue        $10,150
Again… just a few tweaks to the price and now we need even less sales to hit that number.


Something to think about is the percentage of conversions that take the offer.


The higher you can increase your conversion rate from TripWire to Core Offer to Upsell, the more sales you get, the higher value each of your new customer becomes.


As that happens, you can afford to invest more to acquire each new lead.


SCENARIO FOUR:


VIP Prices


Product        Price        Monthly Sales        Monthly Revenue
TripWire        $12        450        $5,400
Core Offer        $37        45        $1,665
Upsell 1        $97        10        $970
Upsell 2        $997        2        $1,994
Total Revenue        $10,029
This is a powerful example of what happens when you have higher ticket offers available.


With only TWO sales, you just added nearly $2k to your monthly revenue total.


See how fast that can add up?


Only two sales out of your 450 customers.  Improve your conversion rate and that generates a lot more money very quickly.


EXCITING, ISN’T IT?  


Bet you wanna call up your old math teacher and thank them!  


Too much?


Yeah… okay.  ☺


SCENARIO FIVE:


Product        Price        Monthly Sales        Monthly Revenue
TripWire        $12        300        $3,600
Core Offer        $67        40        $2,680
Upsell 1        $197        15        $2,955
Upsell 2        $997        1        $997
Here we upped the Core offer $20 and doubled the upsell price.  


Remember, these are mock scenarios just to give you an visual idea of what happens when just a few numbers change.


SCENARIO SIX:


Product        Price        Monthly Sales        Monthly Revenue
TripWire        $20        275        $5,500
Core Offer        $67        40        $2,680
Upsell 1        $197        5        $985
Upsell 2        $997        1        $997
Total Revenue        $10,162
Upped that TripWire and BOOM.  More $$


SCENARIO SEVEN:


Product        Price        Monthly Sales        Monthly Revenue
TripWire        $20        300        $6,000
Core Offer        $67        40        $2,680
Upsell 1        $147        8        $1,176
Upsell 2        $497        1        $497
Total Revenue        $10,353
Some different price points. Lower Upsell prices need a few more front end offers, but not much.


SCENARIO EIGHT:


Product        Price        Monthly Sales        Monthly Revenue
TripWire        $20        300        $6,000
Core Offer        $47        45        $2,115
Upsell 1        $147        10        $1,470
Upsell 2        $497        1        $497
Total Revenue        $10,082
Lowered the Core Offer price… still making $10k.


SCENARIO NINE: – MORE PLEASE!


Product        Price        Monthly Sales        Monthly Revenue
TripWire        $20        500        $10,000
Core Offer        $47        50        $2,350
Upsell 1        $147        10        $1,470
Upsell 2        $497        1        $497
Total Revenue        $14,317
Want to earn more than $10k a month?  Getting those $20 sales on automation isn’t that hard with a good content or ad strategy.


Even with a ten percent conversion rate on upsells, the profits look pretty nice.


SCENARIO TEN: – HIGH ROLLER


Product        Price        Monthly Sales        Monthly Revenue
TripWire        $20        500        $10,000
Core Offer        $47        50        $2,350
Upsell 1 3 PAY        $297        10        $2,970
Upsell 2        $997        1        $997
Total Revenue        $16,317
A few years back, Digital Marketer did a study that found that they could charge THREE Times the price if they divided that price into three payments and it converted almost as well, only a 2% difference.


Instead of charging $97, they charged three payments of $97 and only lost two percent of sales.


Payment Plans are DEFINITELY something you want to consider adding to your model.


Something else you want to consider is making sure that your tripwire cost balances out your ad budget.


Work on your conversion rate and prices so that you break even on any ad costs with trip wire sales.


In other words… If it costs you $2 for a new lead and your tripwire is $20, you need to convert every tenth lead into a customer to break even.


Or… lower your lead cost.


Or… raise your tripwire cost … but that could hurt you if you go above $20 depending on your market.  


If you’ve served them well with your free offer, you may be able to get more.

Just adjust the price column and the number of sales column, don’t touch the totals, as that’s a formula that will automatically change as you change the price and total number of sales.


THAT’s IT!


Changing the way you think about numbers is a POWERFUL way to change the kinds of numbers you have in your bank account each month.

A SIMPLE PATH TOWARDS POWER, PURPOSE, PROSPERITY AND PEACE – AT YOUR OWN PACE
 14 January 2023  0 Comments
https://youtu.be/UuNFR_M2BFs


I’m going to break down a little bit of how I’ve been able to create space to be there for my girls ANY time they need me, both in time and financial support.
I am not the flashy sort. I’m weird by almost every standard. Always have been, always will be. And I’m okay with that.


I have had people look at me and shake their heads more times than I can count and just say “You are so weird.”


I do things differently because a lot of what other people do just doesn’t make sense to me. I can sound really smart but I can also sound REALLY dumb. It can take me a while to wrap my head around some things.


Despite this, I’ve reached a level of success that most will never acheive, when compared to the general population. I won’t quantify that because frankly, it’s private. Suffice it to say I have an incredible amount of freedom in my life due to what I earn and how little time I have to spend earning it.


The first thing to understand is this did not happen FAST.
Part of that is because I got started in 2002 on DIAL UP and NOTHING about the internet could have been considered FAST at that time.


Except for how quickly people could waste time, lose their money or find someone to destroy their marriages with. Some things haven’t changed in that regard.


Even though I had a full-ride scholarship, I dropped out of college three times after only getting past the first term.


Another example of how I can be really smart and REALLY stupid.


I graduated with honors in high school but I never did homework and always did the minumum work to get good enough grades that I *could* earn a scholarship because I wanted a different life so badly.


The pattern of doing *just enough* to get where I wanted to go has been consistent throughout my life.


In some ways, I’ve felt ashamed of that.


I’ve felt like I never really lived up to my potential because I never had the discipline to reach mastery in any particular area.


Case in point, I spent less than an hour on this post between writing, recording, and making the image.  There are MUCH MORE polished people than I. That said… I’m pretty happy with my less-than-polished efforts and results.  


Over the years and decades of adulthood and watching people climb their different ladders… I noticed something about most of those who DID acheive mastery levels.
They had more stress.
They beat themselves up a lot.
They were hard on themselves AND others.
It took a toll on their health and relationships.
I also noticed that a pattern I would observe in most tenacious Goal Getters was how hard they would work to push towards their goals, even when it seemed like the powers of the universe had conspired to slow them down by any means necessary.


And that’s when I realized…


There is a natural rhythm to life that does not respond well to brute force.
There’s a pace at which things seem to have their own “will” to be flowing at.


I learned that if I stopped trying to brute-force my way to the things I wanted, I would get there just as fast, but with less battle scars.


That was one of my experiments. I “tested” what it would be like to cool my jets and push things as far as I could… not to the point of resistance but to the point of PUSH BACK


Resistance is a word people use a lot but I’ll replace it with friction. That uncomfortable feeling of heat from the grinding efforts of pushing forward against a barrier. I never let friction stop me.


What I *do* work to recognize is the point at which my pushing is not getting me any further and now I am on a hamsterwheel, running without going anywhere, or falling down and flying off the wheel completely.


I have experimented with abandoning goals that didn’t seem to be achievable.


I have experimented with letting things take their cool down periods or go at a slower pace periods and just refocusing my energy elsewhere for a while.


What I have found is that many times, inspiration or  opportunity will come that allows me to start making more progress towards a goal again, or allows the progress to resume at a faster pace.


During the cool down periods or slower pace periods… I haven’t stopped thinking about what I wanted and how I can get there.


I starting taking off any fixed/hard deadlines about when things had to happen.
The side effect of taking off what are essentially ARBITRARY DEADLINES is that I removed the desparation from the equation.


I shifted the expectation from WHEN something has to happen to just having something happen.


I have applied this practice to business goals, health goals, spiritual goals and relationship goals.


I have PRIORITIZED PROGRESS OVER DESTINATION AND DEADLINE.
I found that when I took the desparation out, I had more room for INNOVATION and EXPERIMENTATION.


Here’s the thing…


When you are working on a deadline you want to go with the thing you THINK is going to get you the best results.


That is almost always going to be something you learned from someone else. You know about it and think it will work because you saw someone else do it.


What you LOSE in that type of behavior is the opportunity to make your own magic.


If you are less focused on HAVING to do something by a certain time, you can explore the different paths you can take to get there.


When you go slower, you have more time to observe  your surroundings.
You have more time to experiment with different tools and resources and processes.


You can make the journey to  your destination that much richer.


And I would encourage you to strongly consider that.


The truth is, none of us knows when we will draw our last breath.
I can think of nothing sadder than ending this life full of regret and wishing I had better used the time I had here making my own kind of magic.


I test EVERYTHING in my life.  I am always looking to strike a balance between a fulfilling level of growth and improvement with an optimized level of energy and peace.


I have learned I cannot be happy if I don’t have enough work to do in my life.  It does not all need to be income producing but I MUST be employed in purposeful action for the majority of my day or I will languish.


I have learned that if I do too much, my health and relationships suffer, and axiety abounds.
I have also learned that some days and some seasons I can do more than other times.  So I test my capacity often and do not ever assume that what I can do today is the same as yesterday, or that tomorrow will be the same as today.


Through simple little tests, and a willingness to remove arbitrary deadlines that were set “because I want to” or think that’s what they “should” be, I have created a life and business of power, purpose, and peace.


I hope that you can find some value in these things and grow in power, purpose and peace yourself. 💙

I’m Tina Marie, and I’m a business consultant
that has helped several startups grow to million
dollar businesses within a year, and others to
multi-million dollar companies in under three years
from their inception.
To tell you how I got here, I’d have to go back a
good 30+ years. I was entrepreneurial and geeky
from the beginning. At 8, I was learning how to
write programs in BASIC on a Radioshack TRS80
(think floppy disk and cassette tape drives... oh
yeah!) Lemonade stands were a little too social for
my taste, back in the day, so at ten, I was mowing
lawns and babysitting. By 11 I had a paper route
and made a good $65 a month. From that point
on, if I wanted something, I was the one who made
it happen.
I worked in fields picking crops with migrant
workers. I worked in school cafeterias and then
hustled my way into a job at a Law office as a 16
year old runner for 5 local attorneys when I had
decided I wanted to go into law.
I managed to get a full ride to college and then
quit.. Three times before quitting for good, when
I realized I couldn’t stand the agendas and
propoganda that came with the education.
Instead, I found a way to get paid to learn, and
started working in a call center that housed tech
giants like Intel, Apple, Adobe and the likes. While
I started as a technician, I rapidly moved up the
ranks to account management during my 6 years
there. I learned that I have a knack for improving
any environment I worked in via optimization.
My systems saved jobs and accounts before I even
realized the power of what I had created.
After the birth of my second (of four) daughters,
I decided to figure out how to replace my full
time income from home. While I went down the
“SQUIRREL!!!” path that most entrepreneurs find
themselves on, I quickly (Within a year) realized I
could take my existing skills and find a home for
them online.
I’ve been growing companies as a secret weapon
on the inside ever since... all while having the time
to raise my girls, cook their meals, coach them in
sports and do the things that matter most to me.
And now... 16 years after starting online and 17
years after my first child, I’m sharing my systems
with as many entrepreneurs as I can so that others
can be as happy, fulfilled, and liberated as I am.
Working smarter and not harder is not cliche...
It’s an anthem to live by.

Math Is
Your Friend.
Chapter 1
Most entrepreneurs do not go into
business because they love crunching
numbers and balancing the books.
It is impossible to tell someone you are not
speaking to personally exactly how they should
price and package their offers.
This is my solution to that problem.
I am going to give you ten customizable scenarios
with different types of products and packages that
you can plug into your business (with a little brain
power from yourself) that should help you see
what you can change to get more profits out of
your business, with very little additional work other
than creating the offers and writing them up.
Most entrepreneurs get started because they are
unsatisfied with the status quo in some way or
another and find the only solution is to create their
own paths.
We venture out on it and learn as we go. And while
there are tons of great programs that teach how to
SELL or even WHAT to sell...
There is very little spoken about how to package an
offer and what prices to use to hit your goals.
There is a reason for that...
Start With
“Why”?
Chapter 2
Why is it so hard to charge the right
price?
If they cannot do it at all... obviously you have
value.
If you can do it FASTER or BETTER than they
can... you have verifiable value.
When YOU are your product, how you value yourself
has EVERYTHING to do with this struggle.
Here are some things you need to consider in
your mind when you figure out your value to your
clients:
Could they do what you (or your product or
service) will do for them, or as well or as fast as
you could?
Mindset.
Chapter 3
You Actually Are
Expert Enough.
Chapter 3: Part 1
Most unpaid experts don’t yet consider
themselves expert enough to charge
money.
Easy deal, right? That food is going to cost him
money and time, and you’re okay with that, right?
Why? Because you gave him value and you both
know it.
Well... when you’re giving value to a complete
stranger who you are only interacting with
through websites, text, videos and other marketing
materials... even socially on the interwebs...
Trading BBQ for your genius skills isn’t really going
to pan out. And the bottom line is: If you don’t
charge properly you will end up broke.
If you know more than the average person does,
and you can help them do something they could
not do as fast or as well as you can help them to
do, then you are expert enough to charge money.
Money is simply the currency used to exchange
value
Look, let’s say your neighbor wants you to come
help him on the computer because he’s a
technoob and well, you’re awesome. But, because
he’s your friend and lives next door... he doesn’t
offer money, he offers to send you over some of his
killer BBQ when he grills this weekend.
Being Broke
Helps No One.
Chapter 3: Part 2
You are not going to be around to help
anyone because you’re broke and
depressed.
But the economy needs you to contribute!
You have a serious obligation to go out there and
compete for business and serve YOUR MARKET.
You know... the ones who don’t want to do business
with that douchebag Steve who may be as good
or even a little bit better at what you do, but isn’t
worth the investment.
Sound a little brutal? I know. But... YOU KNOW I’M
RIGHT.
So stop arguing with me and with yourself and
listen up.
Getting paid properly is the way to feel free and
happy AND it’s the way to ensure you have the
resources you need to continue to hone your
craft and offer your products and services to the
marketplace.
I don’t want this to go to your head or anything...
Why You and
Not Some Other
Expert?
Chapter 3: Part 3
There are a ton
of reasons why
people will want
to pay you and
not someone else.
I don’t want to spend a long time on this so just
think about how you’ve chosen one person over
another simply on feeling instead of value. If you
show up and do the work, you can find a way to
get a piece of the market.
That’s my pep talk.
If you need one on one advice, you can always some time with me for a little tough love.
(Paid of course... I KNOW MY VALUE)
Pricing and
Packaging.
Chapter 4
Remember, I don’t
know exactly
what you’re doing
and what you’re
offering or how
good you are.
If you feel like you’re not good enough to charge some of these prices... lower them.
Then... improve your skills. That being said... Here’s a good rule of thumb to follow.
If you’re offering one on one consulting time or group coaching (and you’re not a
TOTAL narcissist)...
10% Rule
of Thumb.
Chapter 4: Part 1
Take the highest price you’re
comfortable with charging and then
ADD 10% to that price.
Let’s talk about the different types of products
and services you might offer. This is going to
relate to digital products and virtual services. Any
physical products could be added in as well...
just remember to calculate your profit margins
accordingly.
Once you start getting sales at your price,
incrementally increase your price by 5-10% for
every new customer you take on until you stop
getting conversions.
DON’T BE THE ONE TO TELL YOURSELF NO!
Let your customers tell you what they will pay.
*note – correct pricing and packaging for value isn’t going to be
enough if you don’t know how to pitch your offer. If pitching is hard
for you, study the book called “Pitch Anything” and work on that
skill. It will serve you well in many areas of life to improve this one
skill.
Lead With
Value.
Chapter 4: Part 2
First of all, I’m a big believer in leading
with value.
I grow businesses in many different ways. One of
them is helping entrepreneurs craft solid offers and
clear their head trash so they can actually pitch
them and make money.
I found that is SUCH a common problem that I
decided I would give as much help with that as
possible, free of charge. Obviously, it would work
better one on one... but this is a way I can serve my
market and find potential leads.
Do the same thing for your market.
You’re reading my “lead by example” version of that
right now.
I want you to get some value from me and KNOW
I’m worth investing in before I ever ask you to
invest. If I can’t do that, I’ll probably not convince
you I’m worth your time anyway and that’s just not
a foundation I can build on.
So find a way to create something of value for your
market that you can give away. Create something
that complements OR supplements what you
already do.
Map a Value
Ladder.
Chapter 4: Part 3
The next thing
you will create to
ascend them up
your value ladder
is a low level
offer, sometimes
referred to as a
trip wire.
You can have many different entry points into your marketing “eco system”... it does not have to be simply
linear... but for the sake of simplicity and what I like to focus on, “Fastest Path to Cash” let’s consider a linear
value ladder starting with free, to low cost and upwards.
Your low cost product should be something that can solve ONE specific problem for them. It should be easily
digestible within one to two hours and should allow them the ability to implement within a day.
The price here is between $6-$20. There’s so many ways you can validate that your product (ebook or video
training work really well) is worth more than dinner for two.
It may take you a while to think about why... but think it out.... Write up those bullet points and look at it. When
you look at that and say “That’s a no brainer”... You’ve got a winner.
Don’t
Overthink It.
Chapter 4: Part 4
Remember to
make it easily and
quickly digestible
and actionable!
The problem you will want to solve is not so much
how to give value, not if you know your stuff.
It’s going to be more about demonstrating the
value in a product they haven’t seen yet well
enough to get them to part with their money. So
focus on this part!
Pretend it’s your best friend and you want them to
understand why they HAVE to have this. You would
tell them:
• Benefit!
• Benefit!
• Benefit!
• Benefit!
• Benefit!
What are the benefits of your product? Get CLEAR
on that and making the pitch will be a lot easier, as
will choosing the price.
Your
Core Offer.
Chapter 4: Part 5
The next offer is going to be your core
offer.
This is the one that should bring you the majority
of your income. All of your marketing and products
will be leading up to THIS product or service that
allows you to give max benefit to max audience
size.
My preference is that this is scaleable, so it’s a
digital product or training that modulated and
self-paced (online membership course etc) with
possible weekly trainings, live videos, q and a etc
inside of a group.
This lets you leverage your time while being
able to serve more people at a solid price point.
Upsells.
Chapter 4: Part 6
Upsells are not created to be just one
more possible way to squeeze money
out of a prospect.
Once you’ve shown them value at each level, they
are much more likely to want more from you and
be willing to pay higher prices if you continue to
offer them what they want.
Upsells are going to solve a problem that not
everyone in your market need solved, but the ones
who do need it solved understand the value of it.
I’ll use one of my own value ladders as an example:
It has to be purposeful and make sense for your
market.
Keep this in mind... people that pay the least
expect the most.
It’s harder to sell people on free and $5 than it is to
sell the RIGHT person on $200 or more.
The person who’s focused on VALUE rather than
dollars (no, they are not the same) is going to
be willing to spend more.
TripWire Offer – Projects in a Box
Pre-mapped out project templates for multiple business scenarios to help the “organizationally challenged”
get organized fast. $17 per template
Core Offer – My Freedom Systems - $97
Four modules in a membership site teaching people Email management (email overwhelm KILLS
productivity) Time management, Project Management (next level on what to do with the templates you
bought) and Outsourcing (so you can hire the people to actually do the work)
Upsell 1 – Group Coaching $199/month or $999 for 6 months (one month free)
I offer 15 minute one on one calls twice a month and a weekly q and a call that’s recorded for all members of
the group.
Free Optin/Lead Magnet – 10 Ways to $10k
Upsell 2 – Business Consultation Call $299
90-120 Minute call with me to create a clear plan for what’s next in the business to increase cash and
freedom.
RARE UPSELL – I offer this to less than 1% of my audience
Retainer client agreement. Price varies. They get weekly calls with me and I speak to them and their team
to keep projects on schedule and optimize profits and time. I’ll spend 1-5 hours a week with clients from
$2500-$10,000 a month. It’s not for everyone. The ones who want it are the ones who make enough that my
optimization skills validate the investment.
Applying this to your offer.
Think hard and DON’T undervalue yourself.
Okay... Here’s the worksheet to help you with some
numbers and seeing HOW fast things can add up
to $10k a month for you.
Did I just hear you say “Finally!!!!”???
I better not have!
I had to warm you up to know what to plug in there,
Speedy Gonzales.
Without context, the numbers don’t mean anything.
If you got to this point and skipped the rest above...
Slap yourself on the wrist! Then go back up and
read it.
The strategy is to segment what you offer into a
value ladder that you can ascend your customers
up through.
Use benefit bullet points to help you figure out what
a price is for these offers.
Think about how much time and stress your
product or service will save them.
Use reference points like minimum wage hours
worked vs. expert hours. If you gave them,
effectively, an hour worth of your time, is that not
worth twice minimum wage?
Is it worth dinner for two? Is it worth ... Well... What is
it worth?
Example
Scenarios.
Chapter 5
Scenario One:
Lowballed.
Chapter 5: Part 1
Lowballed.
When you’re too afraid to charge much... do you see how many sales you have to make in order to hit $10,000
a month? Ask yourself... is it harder to charge more and get fewer people to say yes or to charge less and get
more people to say yes?
Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue
TripWire $5 750 $3,750
Core Offer $20 150 $3,000
Upsell 1 $67 50 $3,350
Total Revenue $10,100
Scenario Two:
Bump the Core
Offer.
Chapter 5: Part 2
Bump the Core Offer.
Here, doubled the TripWire cost, but it’s still only $10. We bumped the Core Offer price $7 and left the upsell
the same. Here’s the thing. With this offer, you need 315 LESS “yes’s” to get to $10k a month.
When you think about what’s harder... getting a yes or a yes at a few buck higher... usually it’s just the “yes”
that’s scariest. I told you... MATH IS YOUR FRIEND!
Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue
TripWire $10 500 $5,000
Core Offer $27 100 $2,700
Upsell 1 $67 35 $2,345
Total Revenue $10,045
Scenario Three:
Bump in Price +
Conversion.
Chapter 5: Part 3
Bump in Price + Conversion.
Again... just a few tweaks to the price and now we need even less sales to hit that number.
Something to think about is the percentage of conversions that take the offer. The higher you can increase
your conversion rate from TripWire to Core Offer to Upsell, the more sales you get, the higher value each of
your new customer becomes.
As that happens, you can afford to invest more to acquire each new lead.
Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue
TripWire $12 475 $5,700
Core Offer $37 75 $2,775
Upsell 1 $67 25 $1,675
Total Revenue $10,150
Scenario Four:
Vip Pricing.
Chapter 5: Part 4
Vip Pricing.
This is a powerful example of what happens when you have higher ticket offers available. With only TWO
sales, you just added nearly $2k to your monthly revenue total. See how fast that can add up?
Only two sales out of your 450 customers. Improve your conversion rate and that generates a lot more
money very quickly. EXCITING, ISN’T IT? Bet you wanna call up your old math teacher and thank them!
Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue
TripWire $12 450 $5,400
Core Offer $37 45 $1,665
Upsell 1 $97 10 $970
Upsell 2 $997 2 $1,994
Total Revenue $10,029
Scenario Five:
Double the Upsell
Price.
Chapter 5: Part 5
Double the Upsell Price.
Here we upped the Core offer $20 and doubled the upsell price.
Remember, these are mock scenarios just to give you an visual idea of what happens when just a few
numbers change.
Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue
TripWire $12 300 $3,600
Core Offer $37 40 $2,680
Upsell 1 $197 15 $2,955
Upsell 2 $997 1 $997
Total Revenue $10,232
Scenario Six:
Tripped Up.
Chapter 5: Part 6
Tripped Up.
Upped that TripWire and BOOM. More $$.
Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue
TripWire $20 275 $5,500
Core Offer $67 40 $2,680
Upsell 1 $197 5 $985
Upsell 2 $997 1 $997
Total Revenue $10,162
Scenario Seven:
Lower Upsell
Price.
Chapter 5: Part 7
Lower Upsell Price.
Some different price points. Lower Upsell prices need a few more front end sales, but not much.
Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue
TripWire $20 300 $6,000
Core Offer $67 40 $2,680
Upsell 1 $147 8 $1,176
Upsell 2 $497 1 $497
Total Revenue $10,353
Scenario Eight:
Lower Core Offer
Price.
Chapter 5: Part 8
Lower Core Offer Price.
Lowered the Core Offer price... still making $10k.
Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue
TripWire $20 300 $6,000
Core Offer $47 45 $2,115
Upsell 1 $147 10 $1,470
Upsell 2 $497 1 $497
Total Revenue $10,082
Scenario Nine:
More Please.
Chapter 5: Part 9
More Please.
Want to earn more than $10k a month? Getting those $20 sales on automation isn’t that hard with a good
content or ad strategy.
Even with a ten percent conversion rate on upsells, the profits look pretty nice.
Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue
TripWire $20 500 $10,000
Core Offer $47 50 $2,350
Upsell 1 $147 10 $1,470
Upsell 2 $497 1 $497
Total Revenue $14,317
Scenario Ten:
High Roller.
Chapter 5: Part 10
High Roller.
A few years back, Digital Marketer did a study that found that they could charge THREE Times the price if they
divided that price into three payments and it converted almost as well, only a 2% difference.
Instead of charging $97, they charged three payments of $97 and only lost two percent of sales. Payment
Plans are DEFINITELY something you want to consider adding to your model.
Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue
TripWire $20 500 $10,000
Core Offer $47 50 $2,350
Upsell 1 - 3 PAY $297 10 $2,970
Upsell 2 $997 1 $997
Total Revenue $16,317
Something else you want to consider is making sure that your tripwire cost balances out your ad budget.
Work on your conversion rate and prices so that you break even on any ad costs with trip wire sales.
In other words... If it costs you $2 for a new lead and your tripwire is $20, you need to convert every tenth lead
into a customer to break even.
Or... lower your lead cost.
Or... raise your tripwire cost... but that could hurt you if you go above $20 depending on your market.
If you’ve served them well with your free offer, you may be able to get more.

From: Done Transcript for Tina Maria CAll.txt
00:00:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hey, hey, hey, lady. How are you? You're good. You're good.
00:00:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm a little tired now.
00:00:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I don't know how productive I'll be right now. So let's just make this a short one. How's that?
00:00:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's totally fine. I spent the rest of last night pretty much in the fetal position cramping.
00:00:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, shoot.
00:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, man. I didn't get anything done.
00:00:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I just got off the call with Dan and cramping again. So. Oh, shoot. Well, we can make this short. I mean, I'm excited about everything. So, but we have next week books. I know it's going to be really well.
00:00:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we could probably just see, basically see if there were any thoughts that we had that we could capture that we could use to continue to kind of distill over the weekend until we talk again. I did go check name cheap for. the spicy brain CEO and I'm one that would get all the adjacent domains. I didn't buy anything. I thought I'd talk to you, but spicy CEO, a spicy brain CEO podcast, the spicy brain CEO, spicy brain CEO Za, plural. I would get all of those so that we've got them, you know, copycats and whatnot. It doesn't cost that much. And I'm also maybe a domain addict.
00:01:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know, but having been around, you know, I still own I still own ultimate consulting challenge.com from like 15 years ago when I used to run them all the time.
00:01:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I still own your web business assistant, which is how I got started. Nothing on it, but yeah, I used to own plug-in squeeze page and I let that go away, but somebody owns that now. and it's domain stories are interesting.
00:02:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And it's fun when there's another nerd in the house.
00:02:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that was the biggest thing for me. It's just like I really keep feeling that. love the thought of that spicy brain CEOs and the neurodivergence being able to have a broader umbrella to talk about executive dysfunction because that's not the only thing I think that we could talk about, which this just popped into my brain. But the 80D version of what it's like to be an entrepreneur anyway and most entrepreneurs are 80D. So there's more than just executive dysfunction. There's some of us just can't like I used to be able to read books all the time. I cannot read now. I get annoyed. get angry. If- there's bullet points I can skim. If there's pictures, it makes me feel stupid sometimes that my brain can't focus on attach to if it's small text. I get angry, like legitimately angry. And it used to be the other way around. I would get mad if I was told to listen to something, I needed to see it. So I still need to see it, but my brain is really good at drawing the pictures now because I have enough experience and context to be able to draw the pictures myself. And so I get mad if people want to draw picture and their picture sucks. I get angry.
00:03:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That is funny.
00:03:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Small text, safe, interesting. Yeah, so but that's not just me. There are a lot of us that are just skimmers will not read. And so we need you to be concise. There are some people that love my long messages because their brains are like, oh, it's structured, it's good, it's succinct.
00:03:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And there's others like Tina, stop talking so much, stop writing so much. And they get mad because their brain is overwhelmed with all the things that I've said.
00:04:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that is important when it's in business and you need that information. So I've learned to chunk things into single ideas. I've even had a friend in Sunday school, he's a doctor, pull me aside, like, I don't know how to tell you this, but I need you to just stop and let me chew on one thought that you have, because you go here to here to here to here. And I got angry and I was like, it's not about you, but whatever, maybe it's for somebody else. But there's wisdom in not using a fire hose to give people information. So there's so many nuances to the conversation. And then there's also on the female aspect, ADD for a woman going through a perimenopause and being able to talk about out just neurodivergence and talking about women. So maybe we know that we're going to repel some men and maybe some men are interested because they haven't went lives. Or maybe they just want to know what it's like with the women that they work with. But being okay with talking about female specific things like perimenopause and menopause, where our brains change, the chemistry in ourselves, it changes. But we're not ready to be out to pasture, you know what I mean? And that season of life, again, we're bringing the village back. We've lost the village elders, we've lost the community, but we need the village. And so I think we're bringing the village elders back. And I'm 47, maybe I'm not elder elder, but I'm like, I'm there, you know?
00:05:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, no, I love that. And you know, it's funny, I had a client call earlier today. And it was just an hour call of him and I was checking into what he was always doing, been with me for about 15 years. he just real low. Yeah, but he's kind of right now kind of not doing too much just besides working full time because his wife passed away few years ago and it still hasn't. Yeah. So I was like, what do you want to do? And I was like, you know, it's really just making an extra thousand or two thousand months. I love what I do. You know, so I was like, well, you know, and then I explained for us, he, know what, sometimes you don't want to do, you could just then, instead of starting with your product offer, just start with a podcast or something you want to talk about start interviewing people, right? And I gave an example of us and he's right away, like, I would buy that for my granddaughter, like because she is like in high school, about to go to college. And I know she's got ADHD and maybe this executive dysfunction is like, I'm interested as a buyer or listener to your podcast. So that's awesome. Yeah, yeah. And I, and I told him it was a little bit more for entrepreneurs, but we do want to help people also who are younger too. So I thought that was really cool that he was right away saying, I'll buy that.
00:07:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's amazing. I, that's exciting. But it's also not surprising. I think one thing that I trust in myself is my intuition in being able to read needs of people because that's what always trying to pay attention to. So on a market level, it's, it's really good. But, but yeah, but then there's the other side of me that knows that we have to pace ourselves and build. We can't serve multiple audiences well at the same time. So build for one audience first, serve them well, then extend to the next one, taking best practices from what we learned here. Yeah. And because in, in the, in me trying to serve too many, many people at once. That's where I've created the overwhelm and the disservice also and just the failure to actually launch and gain that momentum. So that would be the one thing. But what I do love is knowing ahead of time that there are multiple facets and paths that will extend and that this one thing, which is also you'll find a huge factor of my operational choices, is I want to do one thing that serves multiple purposes. So everything I do is leveraged and to be able to know that the goal is to also serve youth and help empower them to be able to, because this is what I do with my daughters, choose your path. We were talking about create your own adventure, choose your own adventure books. That's what I've taught my girls how to use computers since they were age two. I've got my oldest, she graduated and immediately got a two-year degree in digital media and design and now she's working on game design as a four-year degree. My second daughter has been a photographer paid since she was 17 and she also does, she's done social media management and now she is a media buyer because I put her through ad skills and how to get work. My 14, my 23-year-old also is a seamstress. sewed prom dresses ball gowns. She taught herself when she was 14. I've always given them all the tools. Like we have sewing machines and embroidering machines. We have cricket machines. They have boxes of stickers. My 17-year-old can do acrylic nails like professionally and she's going to go into beauty school but she's also a seamstress and can sew anything. She makes costumes. They do gore like like crazy Hollywood level gore design and not just gore.
00:09:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hold on. I'm going to show you this real quick.
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but my point is, is that they've also struggled in school, actually, up through seventh grade, sixth grade, they were always taught for their class and teachers helpers. And this is the thing that I've learned about ADHD people, it tends to happen is where the structure changes, and it becomes more homework specific and they pile stuff onto you, rather than allow your brain to take time to learn things. And that's when they just start getting overwhelmed because it's, it's mentally overwhelming. It's not because their brains can't process it. It's just that, I mean, that they're not intelligent enough to do it. It's that the workload is not conducive to actually learning. What? Oh, there it is.
00:10:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
on. Wow.
00:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, a couple of years ago. And then she created this.
00:11:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm trying to get a good that's wild.
00:11:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She made these tails. That's from Sonic. There's a character called Tails and there are two Tails. Yeah, she made that. I put them in the other. That's the same one.
00:11:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, very cool.
00:11:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but I'm teaching them that they can create their own path. I was on the career path of I'm going to go to college because that was my way of escaping, but it was high pressure. It was stressful. It was overwhelming. It was soul crushing. Not to be career oriented and goal oriented, but the path is created to squash creativity and to create conformity. And that is spirit crushing. And most ADHD entrepreneurial types are the types where they know that there's.
00:12:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
it was born to be free. Yeah.
00:12:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if we can help younger people skip, you know, needing to wait until they're in their mid 30s or early 40s to embrace themselves, if we can teach them that their way their brain works isn't wrong, it just needs different things than the institutions provide.
00:12:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:12:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And to feel good about themselves, then they'll go and they'll create this amazing world for us. they're already like Gen Z and Gen. I don't know what the other one there's like, I know what I can't keep track of them, but they're more compassionate, more accepting, more freely themselves. They have a lot of great qualities. But if we can also teach them how to, how to harness their mind. Yeah, and just kind of liberate them because the world still hasn't really learned how to optimize mind and a brain and harness it. That to me is thrilling to think about the impact of that generation and also because they suffer from anxiety so bad. The suicide rates are climbing and it's because they don't know how to deal with this overwhelm and they can't deal with the overwhelm because the institution is created to create more. Yeah. School, right? Yeah. We gotta work hard. We gotta change the math. We gotta do this. We gotta do that. And they're like, but I can't.
00:13:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I can't.
00:13:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it literally can save lives to teach them how their mind works. Yeah. And that it's not disordered and that's actually pretty amazing. I literally think it can see lives.
00:14:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. No, I agree. I agree. I mean, because like, if my friend's son didn't have a support group, who knows, he could have went off the deep van after that doctor's meeting too, right? getting, you know, rebranded, like, you know, because he was thinking, you everything's going wrong for me, you know? Yeah.
00:14:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cool. So, um, yeah, if we want to just keep kind of pondering and let you rest, that's one of the reasons I don't usually do such long calls is because I need a recovery period. There is, uh, it's an energetic exchange and it seems like it's, you know, just talking, but using my brain like that, which is why I don't a lot of clients. There's a huge recovery period from it. Like it's a, it's a big, it doesn't hurt me while I'm doing it. You know, like it's fun and amazing, but I always need a big recovery period and it's, it still surprises me, but I plan for it for the most.
00:15:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's fine.
00:15:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's why the conversation of pace is also a big part of you'll, you'll see, like, yay, calm down. We got calm down.
00:15:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's okay. I love it. I love it. No, and I think I'm going to learn a lot from that.
00:15:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I don't think I control my energy. I think I give way too much away. Oh, I imagine that.
00:15:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:15:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're a, you're a giver and a server and you're very busy. I see all your emails and I see all the things that you're doing. And you're excited. You have a lot to give, but protecting and managing energy has been huge to me because I saw, and I will keep this short, sure saw a real yesterday that was a great way to explain it. And she asked this lady, she said, if I asked you to give me your bank account, count, use your name and password. Would you give it to me? And they was like, probably not. She goes, right. Why? Because like, if she had infinite money, she wouldn't care if somebody took money from her.
00:16:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Right? Oh, there's the analogy.
00:16:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Right. So she goes, I'm asking you for level 10 access, but I'm only showing up maybe as level three, because I'm not giving you money.
00:16:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm not putting money into that.
00:16:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not matching what you're giving me access to.
00:16:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:16:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I was like, wait a minute. So she says, so what you do is you don't try to force people to come up to level 10. What you do is you remove the locks and you give them level access to where they're at. But a lot of times, like in our relationships, we just keep trying to pull people up to our level and want them to give according to what we're giving. Or be worthy of what we're giving because we want to give it to them and we see their worth and their value But they're still only showing up at level three entry level. Yeah, I Was like well, that's amazing, but I think of that in terms of energy So I have a lot of energy and I have given a lot of it, but And here's another quick conversation is that the Filipino lady that I'm working with She wants to create So she's been working from home for years and she's a mom She has a lot of friends like I want to do what you do and I want to be able to work from home And she wants to create a VA program that teaches other people how to become VA so that they can Be mama and still provide for their family and which I've done for the last 22 years And I said I said I love that I said but I could tell you in 22 years Every single person that's ever said Tina help me work from home. So I can do what you do. First of all, you can't do what I do. But I will try to help you work from home. And I will show you these different paths. Not one person ever did the work.
00:18:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, wow.
00:18:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Interesting. Got one. But if they weren't already on the path and going and looking for the information, because it was that important to them, but they were just like, Oh, it sounds, I want what you have.
00:18:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
want to be able to work from home, control over my freedom.
00:18:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But they didn't want it enough to even go look for it. They just wanted enough to ask for it. But I want to give it to everybody. And what I love is that I work up here, because I choose to, and they're here going, I want what you have.
00:18:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But I don't want to do this. Yes. Yeah.
00:18:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So when it comes to like energy management, recognizing that a lot of people will not invest their energy, their mental energy, or their effort. to the same level, even clients, I will fire them if I care about their business more than they do.
00:19:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't care what they're making.
00:19:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If I keep asking you the same question and you tell me it's important to you, but your actions say it's not because you don't do what we agree to do, that means I care about it more than you do because I have to keep bringing it up. When I hired you for that, you don't own me.
00:19:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm not under you.
00:19:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, I don't need you. You need me. And yeah, so learning those things has been given. We have finite energy and finite hours. So anyway, all right. Well, I'm sure that you're fried. probably have nothing else unless you have questions or not. No, no, no, not right now.
00:19:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, just like everything. I like the spicy brain and I just love it the more I think about it.
00:19:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like this is really cool. It's good to do it. So yeah, I love that. Okay, so then Tuesday, we're meeting.
00:20:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, like you said Tuesday.
00:20:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I will make sure not to wear myself out Monday so I can come right at it.
00:20:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But she tailed on Tuesday. Yeah, you're gonna see big difference between one 30 year whatever it was versus after four 30.
00:20:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, I believe that I'm yeah, the time of day definitely matters and the time of the month matters. Maria, I'm ready to be done. Am I help me father? There's no point in this right now.
00:20:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Can you just take it please? you just take it? All right, well, still great connecting with you though.
00:20:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, it's good to talk.

00:00:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, nice.
00:00:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I'm very excited about it. But I have this people that build my deck did not build it right. And so it's very creaky. It's not always been creaky. And that's where I work. And it's driving me bonkers. So now I have to deal with people coming in and out and probably doggies and the doggies like to play tag with the deer around here. They will chase each other up and down the fence. Because if we had some baby deer that were born and they used to sleep under my porch and they've grown up around my dogs.
00:00:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And they will so cool.
00:00:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Chase my dogs and my dogs will chase them. But my dogs will be barking their heads up while it's happening. So it's cute. But also my brain.
00:00:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I love it though.
00:00:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's like deer.
00:00:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Are you kidding me? I remember when I lived in Florida, the golf course community we had deer in our backyard some mornings and beautiful to watch.
00:00:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But they're actually living there. That's That's so cool. I will show you, I'm going to text you a picture of these so you can just kind of see the area.
00:01:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
These are my kiddos and my daughter.
00:01:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going grab my Turn it on. Well, that is my two youngest daughters and my, the one in the back, that's her boyfriend helping them build it. And there's also a tree house that I had built for them up there, which is huge. It's got astroturf and lights inside and papisane chairs and we can see the whole city and It doesn't take a while to get to me because I just turn you on So but so where do you live exactly? Southern Oregon Okay, and so you call it if I'm a falls. It's a dinky little Redneck town is what it is a hillbilly place, and I can't wait to leave but I had babies here, so Years and and so do you have like a big backyard so that though? It's not very big actually so we were resting for a long time after I got divorced I basically found the safest place I could as fast as I could and then they sold it and I didn't get much notice So I had two months to find Finance and close our house Which is that almost snow time. And the criteria primarily was be in our church ward and in our same school district.
00:03:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So that limited it tremendously.
00:03:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it was a beautiful house and it was brand new. So nobody's lived in it. And it's on a hill, which is crazy in the winter because we get a lot of snow. But my kids went from playing outside and playing basketball all the time to day stops playing outside immediately. only moved the block away. But because of the steepness of the hill, these lazy kiddos would not walk up it. So they stopped playing. There's no neighbors that talk and visit. And it's beautiful, but it's just I need them to be where they're engaging with people more and okay, pros and cons to everything.
00:03:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah. So this one they're building.
00:03:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are they building in this picture? That's a gazebo.
00:03:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So it's going to be it's
00:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
going to be, see if I can find a picture to show you what it's going to be, because I also have a really nice couch that goes outside, but the pine tree just keeps dripping sap on it. Well, it would if I didn't keep it covered all the time, but because I keep it covered all the time, nobody wants to deal with the cover and take it off. so this has netting on it. We also have a smoker grill out there, but this is what they're building.
00:04:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, it's going to be gorgeous idea.
00:04:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I already have the lights and everything.
00:04:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Cool.
00:04:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The fairy lights. Yes.
00:04:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I bought this big like wicker egg chair that is. seen those.
00:04:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. So making our, I'm a, I'm a homemaker. That's my money goes to home and family and traveling.
00:04:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's it. I love it. Yeah. We redid our whole backyard last year to want to make it look like an English magical garden. So we have that we we might still. We'll do the gazebo. We said no at first when the designer suggested it. But just because it's mostly evening when I want to be out there.
00:05:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Come here. Come here. Come here.
00:05:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that dear.
00:05:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't say hi.
00:05:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, cute.
00:05:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's my that's my Baha'nies boy. Okay.
00:05:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
English, English garden.
00:05:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I saw picture with your mom or a video. She was smelling her roses and it looked so peaceful and nice back there.
00:05:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It is. Yeah. We're in a really small town here too in Canada. yeah, it's nice. And my mom's backyard. Actually, I worked from her house yesterday afternoon and she was just cute thing because like she goes to take a nap in the afternoon and then and it was really bad rain. Like we've had flooding here and everything. But it. So you're not at about three o'clock yesterday, all of a sudden five o'clock, she comes down and her bathing suit like, what are you doing? It's five o'clock and she goes, I'm going for a swim. I'm tired of being inside the house all day. know, I'm like, Mom, you have more energy than me.
00:06:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you're amazing. It's the naps, Maria.
00:06:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
powerful. It must be because I was just amazed. was just like, here she comes. she's 88 years old and she just, yeah, come down down and get her bathing suit and just goes and swims, jumps in the pool. I'm like, Oh my God. And then she's like, how come you don't have bathing suit here? So I know, you know what? I'm going to go buy second one and just keep it there. Cause I probably would have joined her, right?
00:06:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I told my friend to do. Cause I have a friend and she comes in Queens for me on Friday because she's amazing and an organizer and so smart. Anyway, I talked her into it and pay her good, but I'm like, I'm swimming with me. yeah, yeah, like that water sunshine. I don't need a lot else.
00:06:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. know, that's right.
00:06:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I've been excited about this. I tried to be productive. I'm telling you, the beginning of my existence is not having people to work with. It didn't used to be a problem for me, but the older I get, the more it gets like that. I think part of it also is after getting into this transitionary phase, I really feel my emotions coming on, I'm annoyed by it. But since my older girls have moved out and I haven't had the chaos at home. And the energy of all these people, because I left the workplace, that was difficult. Then the kids got bigger, know, I had four of them. And so that filled me up. But now they're gone most of time. The two are the two oldest are gone all the time and the two youngest are gone most of the time. And so I wasn't aware of how much I was feeding off of their energy, even when they weren't in the room.
00:08:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Got it. Got it.
00:08:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's annoying. I'm not really a cry baby, but like my emotions are I worked so hard to not suppress them anymore.
00:08:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I purposely let them be free, but it's really annoying when it's this one.
00:08:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'll cry when I'm mad. I'll cry when I'm happy.
00:08:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'll cry when away.
00:08:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So like, I've got to figure out. I don't have enough work to hire somebody regularly. And I'm like, if I just get one more client, I'll just pay somebody just to sit there with me.
00:08:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But I need riffing.
00:08:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need somebody to sit there and hammer things out. And I've never needed that before, because I had energy around me. I didn't know that I was literally drawing energy from their presence, even just being in the house. But I'm very conscious of but now because I noticed when I'm productive, it's when they're here and they're busy doing stuff, even if we're not together, I'm like, I can do stuff. They'll be gone all week long. And I'm like, I'm gonna get so much stuff done, get nothing done. The second they get home, like, boop, boop, boop, boop.
00:09:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, interesting. Yeah, so that's where I've been, like I'm not really not getting a lot done, but I did work with chat GBT last night.
00:09:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get these little spurts where something pops to my brain and I will capture it. But that's basically as productive as it gets. I won't sit down and do things. But because you asked me, let me go to my notes here. to be crying, whatever. me look somewhere from my face, stop the leap. What are you, what's that? There's a child. Anyway, so talking about a welcome video, you said to think about video training and structure. so what I was thinking, Let me close this, is that, sorry, I'm not on my normal computer, I'm on my laptop, so I have to kind of like organize everything better for this to crank drive minutes. So, think about video training and structure, and so, I was thinking about this, and I think that no matter what entry point, somebody comes in with me, there are, there are going to be some key principles that I want them to understand before we go forward, because I want them to complete whatever they came here for, because it's always their time otherwise. And so, the thing that I know, wow, that was, sorry, okay, the thing that I know is that, in order for us to do things, we have to be committed to it, so we have to buy into it. Otherwise, it's just a momentary fluke, you know, they're in the moment, like how many times Time is your brain committed to something and your 10 minutes later is like, I'm not the same person.
00:11:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We're not doing that. Yeah.
00:11:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but if I get buy-in, I kind of get buy-in to the spirit, not just the energy of that moment. So, I think in the beginning, I want to tell them when they get there, okay, so and so you sign up for this, whether it's paid or free, whatever it is that we're doing. And the reason that you did it is because there's a result that you want. And there's a result that you want because there's something missing that you don't have or there's something present that you don't want or both. Okay. So, here's how we're going to get it, but let me explain to you why working with me and going through what I'm teaching you is a little bit different. I'm going to explain to you leverage. And I'm going to explain it very quickly, explain what a lever is, and explain how it's doing working you. that's almost impossible making it very simple by applying pressure to a device, a device being a system, a structure, a process, whatever. But I'm actually going to have like a little picture or maybe a jiff that shows a very simple lever, a stick, a rock, a heavy thing, and they're like, you can't move the rock and then you push pressure on the lever, boom, the rock goes up. That's leverage. Most people are not ever thinking about leverage. And if they are thinking about it, it's not constantly, it's not persistently, it's not intentionally. Because everything that I do is leveraged, always looking to increase my leverage. I'm always, people talk about working smarter, not harder, but how do you do it? It's levers. It is what devices can you use that gets more from less. So I want to teach that to them very quickly. Like we just cover that maybe two minutes, but they should be engaged in it. Most of their brain. are going to be like, you were listening, they're probably going to be listening, like, I can get more from less. And you're telling me how people always tell me I should, but they don't tell me how.
00:13:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah.
00:13:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or why it's simple or why it can happen. So they just learn something new. first few seconds that they're there with me.
00:13:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:13:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The next thing is I'm going to tell them I need you to consider energy. This is a resource that we all have. But as you know, it fluctuates. It's sometimes unreliable. It's sometimes not there when you need it to be. But most people think about energy retroactively. I want them to think of it proactively. I am always thinking about energy. I am thinking about tomorrow's energy today. And I'm doing everything I can to maximize today's energy and tomorrow's energy and making my choices consciously so that I have sufficient, if not, plenty of energy to be able to do all the things that are most important to me. And then the next thing I'll tell them about priorities because how do I have energy for the things that are most important to me if I have it consciously and intentionally chosen what is most important to me. So, so-and-so name, we're going to go through an exercise, a series of exercises that are very quick, that are very succinct like the things that I just explained to you that are going to help you sort and filter the current activities that you have so that you can learn how to prioritize them and so that you can learn how to leverage your time to get the most out of it in the least amount of effort as well as maximize your energy. And this might seem like a big ask and that it's a lot to do but what I can tell you is and I promise you that if you will spend whatever time it takes to get to this. Some people can get through it in 10 minutes. Some people take, you know, two hours. But if you take the time to go through and organize these, to complete this task because I don't want to overwhelm them with describing it yet, then I guarantee you, you're going to have a shift in the way that you spend your time and the way that you spend your energy and you will think about it differently forever from this point on. But when you think about it differently, it's going to be so clear in your mind about how you can do differently. when you, here's the thing, if you want to be different, you have to do something different. But if you want that different to be good and strategic, then the difference that you do has to be good and strategic. And I'm going to tell you, without knowing your business, without being over your shoulder, I'm going to show you how you can custom tailor, not according to what I I think is important, but what is important to you, your activities so that you get more from less of your time and so that you have more energy and more peace while you're doing your activities, your work activities, business, whatever. I'll improve that script a little bit, but basically that's it and then send them through the exercise and then have a closing one. Like, okay, this is not, so first of all, I want you to pause for a minute and I want you to ponder and reflect on what did you experience? What was your aha moment? I would like you to write down your ahas. What were your epiphanies? did you notice that maybe you didn't notice before? What did you notice about how you should not be spending your time or how you should be spending your time? What did you notice about energy and what could be altered and improved? Now what we're gonna do is go through and apply this. I want you to do, sort your activities according to, you know, what we just did, and then I want you to spend the next 30 days operating with this new awareness. But what I want you to do again in 30 days, and maybe you're not an overachiever and maybe you want to do it in 90 days, but you want to come back to this activity soon, and what you want to do is the same activity. You want to take stock again of where your time is going, how it's impacting your energy, how it's impacting your profits, because now they've had it all explained to them that it's energy profits, time, all this stuff that they're looking at. And ask yourself, because now you're a new person, you're a new person tomorrow, you're a new person 30 days from now, you're a new person 90 days from now, and I want you to go back through this activity and go, is there something else I'm not paying attention to that I'm not aware of? And what I can promise you is that you will have changed, you will have a new epiphany So if you continue to do this, this is called an iteration, we make a new change, we make a new improvement, and if you continually do that, and maybe it's not every 30 days, maybe sometimes it's every three months, and maybe one day it's six months later, and maybe life got crazy and it's a year later. But thing about this is that I'm going to teach you timeless principles. You can go back and apply anything I'll ever teach you, and every time you apply it, you will have an improvement, because you will have changed in your awareness and understanding will have increased, and so your ability to apply the timeless principle will improve the results. So it doesn't matter, if you're really consistent about doing it, if you're more consistent, you get better results, but every time you do it, you will get good results.
00:18:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, so, so Breaking that out. I I started taking notes here. So so video ones about leverage video to energy and priorities to shift To shift you away like how you spend time how you think about your time And you're gonna kind of have them do exercises in that video too during video too By the way, like it everything you just said first of all Overall summary, but I went into like okay.
00:19:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's let's create this mode. Okay mechanical mode.
00:19:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
get it. I'm good Yeah, yeah. so so yeah, like just real quick Rather than just drawing. I just want to start this little document. So Energy and and here you'll you'll do also talk about yourself and success stories, right? Okay our results So energy and priorities shift away, okay, so and then come back in three days since activity repeat Take stock where time is going how it's impacting your problems. It's all this in video too and the exercises.
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I didn't break these up. What we could do is I could just make whatever comes out and then we cut it if cutting is needed. But what I was imagining is the leverage energy and priorities is all in the welcome video because all of that is a preface to what we're about to do.
00:20:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And it's very short. I cover it in less than five minutes.
00:20:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it could be broken into chapters or it could be broken into short of videos. But I really do think it needs to be a contained thing because this is the before you start you need to have this. It's a micro lesson.
00:20:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Five minutes is still very short.
00:20:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it is a timeless lesson in and of itself. Leverage, energy priorities, and learning how to maximize those and also the concept of persistence and consistency. which are not the same thing. Persistence is how energetically you're at it, right? drive for it. Consistence is frequency. they're both separate elements, but if they're both present, those are productivity amplifiers and magnifiers and multipliers. So that's what makes it leveraged also when there's persistence behind it.
00:21:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Persistence is a leverage.
00:21:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Consistency is a lever. So, but these are not, this is not how people are thinking. Most people don't think this way, which is why when I get the new clients I've been getting are attorneys and doctors and they're paying me a thousand dollars an hour and their minds are blown. And so like I, in my point, is not anything. It's just that these are some of them are Ivy League and They're still not thinking like this. My point is that this is not, people aren't trained this way, but once they have the understanding, these are not difficult concepts and these people are not too stupid to understand this. It is, it's just not taught and given. And so anyway, anybody could apply it to any type of business, any type of activity, any type of stewardship and they will be better, they could be a soccer coach and this would help them. This would help them. You know what I mean? Like any stewardship that you have, leaders said, this is how I think I'm going to be arrogant, but I'm probably arrogant.
00:22:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, I'm sure it would help a lot. I guess the thing I'm thinking in my mind is just, yeah, let's get the training done and out there and start having people go through it to get the more testimonials and stuff for it.
00:22:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, it's just sitting down and getting it done, but I need to just sit down and get it done. Today. It'd be a good day. I just I need to do day. You like just give me do they say Tina? need you to have X done by X and be aggressive about it because I could do it. I need I need accountability. need help. Please.
00:23:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:23:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:23:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So so two questions. Yeah, we can give you deadline is and the first question is is in one week good enough like by Tuesday next week.
00:23:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yeah.
00:23:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because it should take a total of like four hours or less. Like it could be one hour. But I know myself sometimes it condense 60 minutes of concepts into a five minute video more valuable than just blabbing away for 60 minutes.
00:23:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I don't mean think it'll be an hour.
00:23:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I already have a video for this. Actually, I just want to make it for it's way better now. So it's all years ago and it was like 20 minutes. So let's have a deadline of a week from Tuesday. Yep. Oh, Friday. Okay.
00:23:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Friday. Awesome.
00:23:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I could have it done by tomorrow.
00:23:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. But I won't push myself.
00:24:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like I have What's today Tuesday? Yeah, yeah, and the second question is for you to get this done will be better, would it be better for us to just do a working session where I go. Okay, go create video one right now and let's come back in half an hour. Okay, let's do that. So, so, yeah, go create video one right now and then let's reconvene right now.
00:24:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's Well, normally that would be good today because of the work situation.
00:24:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Gotcha.
00:24:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. But but we could say, you know, create first draft today. Let's have a working session tomorrow. Like we can even wrap it up if you want to because I don't want to monopolize your time. I paid for a certain amount and I don't want to use that. Yeah.
00:24:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What? Go ahead. Tomorrow's wide open after 12 noon my time.
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, I didn't get around, yeah, my brain, Maria, oh, so I'm taking my daughter to girls camp tomorrow. That's early in the morning. And, um, the heck is that? Oh, so I found a co-working thing yesterday, actually. Oh, cool. And, um, it's called flow dock club, I think.
00:25:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:25:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to try doing something like that.
00:25:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
totally forgot about it already.
00:25:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But, um, flow dot club, I'll go to the website. Yeah, go look at that.
00:25:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Right. We're going to get your work done. Go get focused free. Oh, that's cool.
00:25:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It seems like different people create their own sessions and their types of sessions. that they want. So this one that I chose, it's called 120 minutes, finished strong flow club with Lex, and she's like a law student or something. And so they have five minutes of briefly sharing goals with the group, 50 minutes of doing solo focus work on mute, five minutes celebrating at the end. And I was like, that's perfect.
00:26:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's amazing. This is amazing.
00:26:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:26:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, I really need that.
00:26:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So.
00:26:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Wow.
00:26:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:26:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Right. Yeah, I like it.
00:26:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but then I meant if it was today, that'd be even better. I don't know how they're, how long they're gonna be working on this because even though, but I imagine it's gonna be a while and that's just a major brain disruptor.
00:26:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, no, I get it. I get it.
00:26:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like if I have my cleaner here and sometimes just ask me questions. Oh, I know. Yeah. Oh, you're going to hair appointment is white going with you. Are they still working? I'll pay you all. I love you. Bye. Have fun. I love her hair done. Okay, so hasn't told me what time she wants to be for girls camp tomorrow and it's 45 minutes away. So I really Don't know what my availability is until I know at least she'll be there by 10.
00:27:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I at least we'll be back by 11 My time so noon my time is to wake up. Wait, what time did you say you're available? Yeah, like after 12 noon Um, nine a.m. So If you're available after 12 noon, your time that's three o'clock, my time that works. I go up till about five o'clock. And then Thursday, Thursday after 2.30 PM, after 11.30 AM your time.
00:28:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I have a call with Dan from 12 to 1 on Thursdays, but then I'm done after that. So if you have that time block tomorrow at noon, and I hate to ask for a tentative time, but I'm okay if you can't do it. But if we're just reviewing what there is and then, because honestly, if I finished it, I'll just send it to you and say, here's what we thought. And so it doesn't necessarily have to be a fixed time. We can just do kind of a back and forth for the most part. And then if... I can experiment with that flow session and see if that's helpful, but basically what I need for me. Okay, so your offer super , by the way, was, you know, it takes you 18 or whatever, 180 hours. I don't remember to come up. was a structure and a format of things that need to get and things that you would extract and then this is what we've got out. So the bullet point of even that mental focus of, okay, these are the things that we need to have. So you go, you know, Tina, you go create this and then you're telling me if you tell me what you're doing, that will help me just go, okay, these are my containers.
00:29:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I need to go fill them up.
00:29:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And is there, I don't even like, if I could look at the sales page, I'd go back and look at that. Epic, could you help me figure out what the structure is and what, what all I want to need to do and like, how do we get to the finished product? So I know if I create it, the, I create the training, um, then there's, there's copy and there's all these other things. What parts do you do? What parts are we doing together?
00:30:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:30:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
been a thing.
00:30:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So basically, um, I'll, and you're kind of a rare breach that you're going to So like, I kind of do the copy and, but you know, you, like, you might have something that's like stellar to write instead or add to it, et cetera. Um, less is more in these little $3 things. keep in mind it's really just a headline bullet points stuff. And then, um, I will like, uh, help put together basically, like once you have the training done, like I can kind of just take a look at it and. Just, it's more just review what you've done, like, like, again, you're kind of every that you're very experienced all this. So it's more like, is there a worksheet or success action that needs to be better or added to it to make sure there's consumption, right? my biggest thing about this is like, how many people are really going to use it? So there's that. And as far as getting it done, yeah, like I'll do the sales page and even the technical set up of it and the reality is, again, then what's the order bump going to be? So I help strategize like what the offer portfolio is. So what the order bump should be and then what is the what's after they buy the $3 thing, whether or not they buy the order bump or not, they land on either a thanks page or like upsell one page. So typically what's not in scope, obviously, is crafting up to the one upsell too for you. But typically what a lot of people do, and I even suggest that even for the, like, product boss who've made a million dollars with their $37 offer, right, is they first started with just the front end thing, and then it wasn't up. So one was just a thank you page for the first month. And then after that, they added. So what you could do on the thinking page, like we just need to figure out what what you want to send them into. So it could be, you know, book a call and into, you know, your private coaching, it could be, you know, just for now, love how creating hybrid coaching, like, I don't know what it looks like, and how much of your time I can buy, and how much of your help I could have that being able to stay focused and basically getting through the offer creation.
00:32:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If I can implement this co-working so I've got, you know, something to help me do my stuff where I don't need your high level brain. But I tend to overthink offers, and copy. I do know less is more, but I also know that long copy does a really good job when somebody needs more time to be convinced so I go through a gamut of logic and I just go like that. But I also know that done is better than perfect and perfect isn't real. But because I get stuck in my head having somebody just go, well, this works. Let's try this. You know, this is what I do with my people.
00:33:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, let's just try it. Like, you don't know. Yeah, that's kind of what that is. Just try it. That's kind of what this is because like, what I, to be honest, what I kind of foresee for you for just a cadence, I really feel this is that it'd be cool because you're also your energy so amazing live and zoom and stuff. It'd be cool if like, end result, six months from now, what's the cadence look like? That, And also from the customer journey point of view is that they come in and two ways to get access to you from cold, right? Is either buying the $3 thing and remember you're still building your list because the way the $3 thing is they opt in, right? For it before they buy so they're gonna have lot of abandoned carts Which is still on your list and that person might buy something else for me And and then you have once a month like a mid ticket like a hundred dollar maybe live workshop once a month. That's it So you're starting to build an offer portfolio from that because if the workshop is slightly different every month not the same one Those things can become you're up. So one you're up cell to see how we're kind of the case But also I'm riding on something else here. That's interesting We're in a weird and year into this also because your your love of psychology and everything and trends Um 2024 and 2025 26 we're in a weird movement moving forward because with AI and everything. Yeah, content online is a commodity like anybody like you know a 16 year old kid could pretend to be a 45 year old and say I made a million dollars and put up a bunch of content and you know whatever do okay so I think we're shifting to A that's why I like the $3 thing people want some immediate thing for cheap right to get to know you yeah low-risk yeah and they get a taste of your stuff but be also some live access to you because authenticity sells right so so in that live access you know is engineered like I'll get to the group coaching session for second but but if it's once a month like this workshop you don't have to do this for the rest of your life you actually building up all these other little products that can be sold and then also the workshops can be recorded and chair won't go up sorry and so that becomes part of the concert That library anyway, my brain will exactly exactly. And then if you're going to this, this is actually, I'm actually re visualizing my own micro offer kind of business to is is and I like this concept is that then you go to the hybrid coaching that's way more high ticket, like maybe it's a hundred bucks a week or 250 a week with you and you're only doing in your game for this to, you know, live coaching a month. But they get access to you. We can figure out what the pricing is and stuff, but because I know you're really good at that, like, because that really resonated with me last week about the value, right? so discounting. But you know, you could have some more high end kind of group container coaching that is not like open, close, open, close.
00:36:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's more like it's there.
00:36:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I don't like that game and also can't talk about consistency.
00:36:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, do that. So it's out of alignment. with my other principles to do.
00:37:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. so the monthly workshops can also be built based on kind of the feedback you're getting from people. Like you could have a beta, beta founders join my, you know, XYZ program, you know, Go ahead.
00:37:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was just going to say what I like about it being so low ticket filling it up is that what what is really difficult for me is low energy. So, so like when I show up to alive and I've done group training and there's hardly anybody there and everyone's quiet, it drives me nuts. I can talk to myself. I want to. I don't enjoy just hearing the sound of my voice that you wouldn't know because I don't shut up. But this energy, it's because of you. Like, because you're here and not just because a person is here, but a person with an amazing mind and personality and values, I'm feeding off of that. So if there's nobody in there or there's a couple of people or their weak energy, like I really want to be able to fill up a room.
00:38:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:38:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Again, back to I draw energy from kids that are here, and I'm not even with them. Like I'm very sensitive to energy. But also, as you've experienced, I can project it, which is why I'm never afraid of AI because no type of AI has spiritual soulful energy. And I do know that my translates through text even.
00:38:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know how.
00:38:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know why, but I know that when people read my words, even just the words change them. Pure text, no images. So, you know, like I'm excited for that, but I also have to keep it in the energy container of, I can't build a framework that requires too much of my time. I need to leverage my time so that yeah, whatever access people get to me. Um, what I wanted to be is an environment where the energy is there for them to top into because even if they are aware that they're feeling the energy and being benefited by the energy, they're still being benefited by it. They don't have to. They just need to feel it and that they're getting so, so one of the things that I've learned is that where most people just kind of throw a grenade at a business or they just make you want to overhaul everything, I'm taking surgical cuts, that's what the leverage is. So anyway, but I really want to be able to find a way to work with you long term. I don't think I need a lot of your time and maybe because we were talking about the CEO of the Spicy Brain CEO being separate, but and I would love to serve you if there would be a way that you would like to use my brain, I would be happy to just share it. Find like I'm not opposed to paying obviously. Yeah. Yeah, not what I mean, but whatever it is Maria I really I want to spend more time doing this together. I would love to support you So to separate I have a habit of converging things and this needs to have its container But anyway, I get excited when you talk about it and those offers that makes logical sense to me And I'm excited because this is what I need Cool. Yeah, so so no, it's cool So yeah, and I definitely think that too because I think you could help me a lot on focusing and in your time management stuff and just You know, yeah, so so now so really what we're talking about is sort of like you're just selling Different levels of access to yourself right like is the three-dollar thing You know is like there's just your training right in the worksheets, you know, but I do have more training So just just because my work on Yeah semantics of it and logistics of it like there is definitely more training to be had that doesn't need to have access. Yeah, because I think that I can train it in video very well. And I think that my energy and my experience have been that even in video and it doesn't have to be live, the energy is still contagious. Yeah, infectious, you know, and so I do think that they're on the spectrum are more levels of it's not access to me per se, but just to the training and that there's always an upsell of access with whatever level of training they're getting. yeah. But there's definitely more modular type stuff that we can sell and package and put together. And if I do these co-working sessions, I can hammer them out because I can do the stuff in my sleep. Yeah, have the energy, just the energy. Yeah, anyway, so that help kind of Yes, we're selling access to me. Yes, there's a spectrum of it and the price point, but we also can sell just the information and the training. That's a lot of words to insert that. Sorry.
00:42:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, no, I got it. That's good. good. um, yeah. So I think, I think, yeah, first up, let's just get the training part done, the $3 thing done. um, you said, your clients just get out there.
00:42:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I'll get it out there. Okay.
00:42:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And just, so, and just close things off. um, when are we, it's kind of potentially tomorrow, right? And you're just going to text me.
00:42:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what, how about we do this because I, I don't, um, can we schedule it for Thursday or even, um, Friday? And do just email communication back and forth, because I think if I create something, we don't need to be on a call for you to say, you know, you need to go create this, like, I just need you to be able to review it. And then to me calls are for brainstorming, clarity, you know, things that can't be done through email or vox or even I love the audio messages, because I don't like I love talking to you. I love that. If I if I can just get the stuff done, I'd rather have your time for riffing, you know, that type of thing that can't be accomplished the other way.
00:43:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
